Hess, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn August 15, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 12, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 30, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 12, \n2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on February 26, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 8, 2009. I convened the hearing on said date. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F into \nevidence that were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 12) The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through V. Applicant did not object to \nmy consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed are limited \nto matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d. \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He was born in Iraq and went to high school there. \nFrom September 1974 to September 1977, he attended an Iraqi university where he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in agricultural engineering. In 1978, he married his wife, an \nIraqi citizen at the time.  As required by the Iraqi government, he began basic training in \nthe army in December 1978. He left the army without permission in February 1979 and \nwent to Kuwait in October 1979. His wife joined him four to six months later. They lived \nthere until late 1985, when they came to the United States on visitors\u2019 visas. They \nstayed for a couple months, during which time they applied for immigrant visas with the \nhelp of Applicant\u2019s brother, who was residing in the United States. (GE 2). \n \n \nUpon being denied U.S. immigrant visas, Applicant and his wife went to Canada \nin early 1986, as refugees, while waiting for U.S. permanent resident status. In 1990, he \nobtained Canadian citizenship, as did his wife and two sons. One of his sons was born \nin Iraq and one son was born in Kuwait. His daughter was born in Canada. They lived \nand worked in Canada until October 1996 when they moved to the United States after \nbeing granted U.S. resident alien status. In August 2004, Applicant and his family \nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens.  \n \n  \nAfter arriving in the United States in 1996, Applicant worked as a truck driver and \nhis wife found a position in a bank. In February 2004, he obtained a position with a \nfederal contractor to work with the U.S. Coalition Forces (Forces) to help organize the \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nIraqi elections.  He worked in Iraq until July 2004, when he returned to the United States \nand resumed his previous job as a truck driver. (GE 2) In August 2005, Applicant was \nhired by a federal contractor as a bilingual, bi-cultural agricultural advisor for the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. In that role, he has been assisting the Iraqi government in \nthe improvement of its agricultural resources and conditions. (Tr. 24) There is no \nevidence that Applicant returned to Iraq until February 2004 when he was employed by \nthe Forces. \n \n \nApplicant and his family maintain dual citizenship with Canada. He never voted in \nany Canadian election and does not hold any property or have any financial interests in \nCanada. He does not travel to Canada to maintain privileges of citizenship. The last \ntime he used his Canadian passport was to travel to Iraq between March 2004 and July \n2004, when he was employed by the Forces and sent to Iraq. He destroyed that \npassport in September 2004, when he received his U.S. passport (after becoming a \nU.S. citizen in August 2004). He has traveled to Canada periodically for a vacation, \nusing his state\u2019s driver license or U.S. passport.  His last visit was in December 2008 for \na short vacation. (GE 1) He has no intention of exercising any rights as a Canadian \ncitizen.1 (GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. They are deceased. Both of them were \nteachers. (Tr. 34) He is one of six children, four boys and two girls, all of whom were \nborn in Iraq. One of his brothers was killed during the Iraq-Iran war. One brother is a \nU.S. naturalized citizen and resident of the United States. He is a practicing physician. \nHis third brother is a citizen resident of Iraq. In August 2008, that brother retired from his \ngovernment position as an accountant for the Ministry of Defense. (Tr. 38) Applicant \nsaw him about six months ago in the Green Zone of Iraq because both of their offices \nare located in the international area. (Tr. 39) He speaks to his brother about once every \nmonth and a half. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s two sisters are resident citizens of Iraq. One of them \nis a widow and the other is single. Neither of them works. (Tr. 29) He rarely sees them \nbecause they live outside of the Green Zone. He speaks to them every couple months. \n(Tr. 40) The last time he saw them was in 2006 when he visited their city on business. \nThey do not know that he works in Iraq for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (Tr. 41) \nHis wife has two sisters, who are resident citizens of Iraq. He does not have any contact \nwith them. He does not know how often his wife speaks to them. She has not seen her \nsisters since leaving Iraq in 1979. (Tr. 43) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owns two houses in the United States and has U. S. bank accounts. \n(Tr. 27) His wife is a manager of a bank. (Tr. 26) His two sons work for U.S. companies \nand his daughter goes to cosmetology school. (Tr. 48) He does not own any property in \nIraq. (Tr. 55) There is no derogatory information in the record concerning his police or \nfinancial records. He has never been fired from a job. He has never been arrested. He \nhas never used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (GE 1) \n \n                                            \n1The SOR did not raise any security concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits, setting forth his accomplishments while \nworking in Iraq.  In May 2004, the Governance Coordinator for the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority recommended Applicant for a position with the new U.S. Embassy in \nBaghdad. The Coordinator noted that \u201cDuring the outbreak of criminal violence last \nmonth, you continued your work, at great personal risk, which ensured that we were \nable to make rapid progress when security was restored.\u201d (GE 2) In June 2004, the \nAdministrator for the Coalition Provisional Authority thanked him for his efforts in \nworking to establish a democracy. (AE D) In June 2006, the Director of the Civil Military \nOperations Directorate recognized Applicant\u2019s talents and assistance. He wrote, \n\u201cThrough [Applicant\u2019s] connections with the Iraqi government and with his ability to \nknowledgably communicate about agricultural issues and especially in Arabic, he has \nbeen able to help the Coalition Forces forge forward in developing national level policies \nand assist in building a cohesive partnership between the two governments in the area \nof Agriculture.\u201d (GE 2) \n \n \n In 2007, Applicant received a 2006 Foreign Agricultural Service Honorary Award \nfor \u201cselfless dedication to rebuilding a strong relationship with Iraq and cultivating an \nenvironment of trust and partnership.\u201d (AE A) The U.S. Agriculture Attach\u00e9 submitted a \nstrong Letter of Recommendation, referencing Applicant\u2019s work from September 2006 to \nFebruary 2009. He noted that Applicant had passed through security and background \nchecks. He stated, \u201cPerforming as much more than just a Bilingual/Bicultural advisor, \nwe rely on [Applicant] as a key interlocutor for our diplomatic engagements . . . His \nperformance has been all the more remarkable given the stressful, dangerous, and \nchaotic working conditions in Iraq.\u201d (AE B) The Senior Strategic Policy Advisor at the \nU.S. Embassy Baghdad submitted a letter, having worked with Applicant for more than \ntwo years. In February 2009, he wrote that Applicant \u201cis an individual with tremendous \nprofessional and personal worth to our office with the U.S. Embassy in a war-zone \ntheater of operations. This letter of introduction will serve as my highest \nrecommendation for a most valued and loyal employee.\u201d (AE C) \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and desire \nto continue his work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cI am American . . . My \nloyalty is for this country.\u201d (Tr. 47) In his closing argument, he stated: \n \n I know, ma\u2019am, the Iraq is dangerous country, but we have to realize one \nday this country is going to be normal country, and if we don\u2019t take the risk \nto make the change I don\u2019t think anybody can make the change.  And we \nare the people we could make the change to help the U.S. government. \nAnd we [have] been working so hard to achieve this, this goal.  (Tr. 53) \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Hearing Exhibits, including \nthe fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. Despite the \nelections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al \nQaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nwith aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq \nremains, although there has been a decrease in violence since January 2008. \u201cAn \nimproved security environment has resulted from the combined factors of Coalition \ntroop surge and sustained presence, the declared ceasefire by Muqtada al-Sadr\u2019s Jaysh \nal Mahdi militia in August, improved Iraqi Security Forces proficiency, and increasing \npopular support for the actions of Iraqi Forces again AQI and other extremist groups.\u201d \n(HE IV). Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for foreign influence are set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;2 and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n                                            \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nSince leaving Iraq, Applicant has maintained telephone contact with his brother \nand two sisters, who are residents and citizens of Iraq. He does not maintain contact \nwith his two sister-in-laws. After he started working in Iraq in 2005, Applicant periodically \nsaw his brother who worked in the same international complex where he worked. He \nspeaks to him approximately once a month. He calls his sisters every couple months \nbut has not seen either of them since 2006. His sisters do not know that he works for \nthe U.S. government in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family in Iraq could create a \npotential conflict of interest between his security obligations and desire to help them, \nonly in a situation wherein they were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if \nhe did not cooperate. Since retiring, his brother is no longer connected with the Iraqi \ngovernment. His sisters do not work. None of them have positions in which they could \notherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or technology. However, \nunder either disqualifying condition, security concerns in this case could arise in \nconnection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected information from \nApplicant by threatening harm to his family members in Iraq.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Those with potential application in this case are:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe current positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq do not \ninvolve the government or military and they would have no interest in acquiring \nprotected information. Only their physical presence creates the potential that their \ninterests could be threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice \nbetween their interest and those of the United States. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) has some \napplication.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant produced significant evidence establishing AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his \nrelationship and depth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the United States. He has lived in the United States since 1996 \nand has not returned to Iraq until his employment with the U. S. Coalition Forces in \nFebruary 2004. His wife and children are U.S. citizens, residing and working in the \nUnited States. He owns property and holds bank accounts in the United States. He \nworked for a U.S. company before starting his position with a federal contractor. He \ndoes not own property in Iraq and has had limited contact with three siblings living \nthere. While in Iraq, he has willingly risked his life to support the U.S. efforts. There is no \nevidence that he has connections or contact with any people other than his family \nmembers. He refers to himself as an \u201cAmerican.\u201d \n \nApplicant maintains ongoing, albeit sporadic, communication with his siblings in \nIraq. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(c) cannot apply, as those contacts are sufficiently frequent and not \ncasual.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or \nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Three circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nfriendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s siblings to obtain such \ninformation. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1996. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there. He was \neducated at an Iraqi college, married there, and has one son that was born there. Third, \nthree of his siblings and two in-laws remain resident citizens of Iraq.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 12 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for almost five years. His spouse and children are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. Out of his sense of patriotism for the United States in its \nendeavors in Iraq, he has worked for the U.S. government as an Arabic-speaking \nadvisor. His ties to the United States, which he refers to as his country, are much \nstronger than his ties to his three siblings or two sister-in-laws living in Iraq. There is no \nevidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the United \nStates. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he has worked diligently \nand impressively for three years in an important capacity for the U.S. efforts. His \nsupervisors and colleagues assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and \nresponsible, giving him excellent evaluations and praising his dedication to the cause of \nfreedom in Iraq. He is a good family member, employee and U.S. citizen. After leaving \nIraq in 1979, he never returned until he worked with the U.S. forces in February 2004, \nwhich was prior to his obtaining U.S. citizenship. \n \n No witnesses recommended denial of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no \nderogatory information about him in the record. There is evidence that he has \nsuccessfully worked in high-risk circumstances and made significant contributions to the \nUnited States in its agricultural efforts in Iraq. He credibly asserted his allegiance to the \nUnited States. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as a bi-cultural translator and advisor in Iraq, I conclude Applicant has fully \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.3 Overall, the record \nevidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising under Guideline B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n                                            \n3I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                             \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nIn an undated response received by DOHA on April 30, 2009, Applicant admitted\n8 of 13 allegations under Guideline F and 4 of 6 allegations under Guideline E.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated May 28,\n2009. Applicant received the FORM on June 8, 2009, but declined to respond to its\ncontents. On December 7, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded the case for\nassignment to an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on the same day.\nJanuary 27, 2010\n\n Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR). Applicant failed to note information regarding her children on her\n      1\nsecurity clearance application.\n Item 6 at 2. Specifics regarding these and other incidents are vague. \n      2\n Id. Applicant provides no details regarding this lay off or potential lay-off.\n      3\n Id. at 2-3.\n      4\n W ith regards to her co-signing aid for her \u201csons,\u201d Applicant noted they had \u201cscrewed me one to [sic] many\n      5\ntimes and its not happen [sic] again.\u201d Item 6 at 4. \n Id. at 4.\n      6\n Id.\n      7\n2\nBased on a review of the case file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to\nmeet her burden regarding the security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old administration specialist who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since September 2007. She has also been employed as a financial\naid advisor for a state university since 1999. Applicant has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin business administration. Married, Applicant has \u201csent 3 kids to college [and] the last\none is still attending college in her second year.\u201d  In choosing an administrative\n1\ndetermination, Applicant chose to rely on the written record. The facts she submitted\nwith regard to her financial situation are mostly derived from her response to the SOR\nand her responses to DOHA Interrogatories. These narratives are comprised of\ncomments unsupported by documentary evidence. Because the information provided\nwas brief, the facts of record are scant.\nApplicant was laid off from a job in 2004, resulting in a year-long period of\nunemployment and the interruption of a debt consolidation repayment plan.  Two years\n2\nlater, she faced another lay-off.  During this time period, she co-signed on various\n3\naccounts for one or more sons, which they neglected.  These included two car\n4\npurchases and the acquisition of an apartment.  When Applicant was apprised that she\n5\nhad a number of delinquent accounts noted on her credit report, she stated that she\nwas unaware of the contents of her credit report and ultimately denied knowledge of\nsome of the accounts.  She implies, however, that some of the entries might be the\n6\nresult of identity theft because she lost her driver\u2019s license and a military identification\ncard in 1999 or 2000.  \n7\nWhen completing her security clearance application, Applicant denied having\nbeen delinquent on any debts for over 180 days within the last 7 years. She did so\nbecause she believed she had reactivated a repayment plan to address her outstanding\ndebts, thus placing them in active repayment. She was unaware that payments on this\n\n Id. at 6.\n      8\n Id.\n      9\n Response to the SOR at 3.\n      10\n Applicant claims in her Response to the SOR that this account was paid off, but failed to provide evidence\n      11\nthat this debt was satisfied.\n Applicant claims in her Response to the SOR that this amount represents the total owed by her son on\n      12\na car loan. She states that the sum is his responsibility, but concedes she was a co-signer on the loan.\n Id.\n      13\n Applicant claims in her Response to the SOR that this amount represents a sum owed by her son(s) for\n      14\nan apartment for which she was a co-signer.\n Applicant simultaneously admits and denied knowledge of this account.\n      15\n3\nrepayment plan had not been reinitiated when she started her present job.  For the\n8\nsame reason, she answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking whether she was currently over\n90 days delinquent on any debts. She also answered \u201cno\u201d to these questions because\nshe was \u201ca little uneasy with putting all [her] personal information on the internet.\u201d  \n9\nOn her security clearance application, Applicant denied she was charged or\nconvicted with a felony offense or, in the last seven years, with any other offense. She\nadmitted, however, that she was found guilty of theft by deception on January 29, 1996,\nsentenced to a year in jail, two years of probation, and a fine of $371 for issuing two\nbad checks. She maintains, however, that a relative living with her wrote the checks\nwithout her permission.  She also admitted that she was charged with theft by\n10\ndeception in April 1991, but notes that it was due to an overdraft caused by mis-\ncommunication between her husband and herself. She denied that she was charged\nwith theft of services/failure to pay a just debt in October 1991, and theft of services in\nApril 1992, but provided no evidence to support her claim. \nAt issue in the SOR are 13 delinquent accounts, noted in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a\u20131.m. Applicant admitted those allegations noted in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($1,070), 1.c ($1,042), 1.f\n($203),  1.g ($16,876),  1.h ($11,073),  1.I ($162); 1.j ($1,980),  and 1.m ($48).\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nConsequently, she admitted that she has about $32,500 in delinquent debt. She denies\nthe remaining financial allegations, but provides no evidence or explanation supporting\nher denials. These debts amount to about $5,000. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      16\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      17\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      18\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      19\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      20\n4\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n16\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n17\nis on the applicant.  \n18\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\n19\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any\n20\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\n\n Id.\n      21\n5\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to\n21\ndeny an individual a security clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an\napplicant\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a\nclearance.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are\nthe most pertinent to the case. Applicable conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set\nforth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d It\nalso states that \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d Here, Applicant admitted that she has at least\n$32,500 in delinquent debt. While she denies responsibility for an additional sum total\nof about $5,000 in debt, she provided no evidence that those debts are not hers or that\nthey have been formally disputed. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such conditions\nraised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security\nconcerns.  \nAlthough she failed to provide specific dates for any periods of unemployment,\nApplicant repeatedly referenced at least one lay off in 2004 that affected her ability to\nmake timely payments on a debt repayment plan. Such a situation is sufficient to raise\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are multiple in number and remain unpaid. She\nadmits to debt amounting to approximately $32,500. While she alludes to one or more\nrepayment plans, she failed to submit evidence of their existence, her payments on\nsuch a plan or plans, or any other documentary evidence indicating she has attempted\nto address the debts at issue. She similarly failed to present documentary evidence that\nshe has a scheme to address these debts in the near future or that she has received\nany form of financial counseling. Therefore, neither Financial Considerations Mitigating\n\n It is unclear whether this is the job from which she was temporarily laid off. There is no evidence,\n      22\nhowever, showing that she was ever totally without some income or forced to receive unemployment benefits.\nThere is only her statements that there was sufficient income to continue on a debt repayment plan. \n6\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts), nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control) applies.\nApplicant currently holds two jobs, one of which is a state job she apparently has\nheld uninterrupted since 1999.  In the past two years, however, she apparently has\n22\nheld two jobs without interruption. There is no indication that during this period she\nreinitiated repayment on her debt payment plan or sought out an alternative method for\naddressing the debts at issue. There is no evidence that any of these debts have been\npaid or disputed. With no evidence shown indicating some degree of progress on the\ndebts at issue, financial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d The guideline further notes that \u201cany failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process\u201d is of special interest. Here, evidence was presented\nsuggesting Applicant was less than forthcoming with regard to her police record on her\nsecurity clearance application and indicating she falsified material facts regarding her\ndelinquent debts. \nThere is no directl evidence that Applicant intentionally misled or deceived when\nshe denied having a police record. All the incidents at issue occurred over seven years\nprior to her security clearance application certification and there is no evidence as to\nwhether she knew if her 1991 charge or 1996 conviction for theft by deception were\nfelony incidents. She did, however, know that she was under a debt repayment plan\nwhen she was laid off in 2004, that payments under that plan ceased when she could\nno longer make them, and that the repayment plan involved significantly overdue\naccounts. Her decision not to acknowledge the existence of the repayment plan, if not\nthe accounts being addressed under that plan, clearly misrepresented her financial\nsituation. Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies.\n\n7\nApplicant completed her security clearance application in October 2007.\nAlthough she failed to submit information as to what accounts were included in her\nrepayment plan or provide some indication as to the sum at issue, reference to the\naccounts at issue indicate that her total liability for delinquent debts is quite high, nearly\n$40,000. To date, she has yet to express a complete understanding of the true extent\nof her debt or the contents of her credit report. Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition\n(PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply, nor does PC MC \u00b6 16(e) (the individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). None\nof the other mitigating conditions apply.\u00b6\u00b6 \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature woman who has worked two jobs simultaneously since at\nleast September 2007. While she demonstrated maternal concern in co-signing loans\nwith her sons, she ultimately became liable for their loans, leaving her liable for the\nloans at issue. While she stated that she had a number of her debts included in a\nrepayment plan, she failed to submit a copy of that repayment plan and similarly failed\nto provide a list of what debts were included under such a plan. Her lack of specificity\nwith regard to her period or periods of unemployment is as vague as her narrative\nregarding the debts at issue. In these proceedings, the burden is squarely on the\nApplicant to mitigate security concerns. By choosing an administrative determination in\n\n8\nlieu of a hearing, she chose to rely on a scant record virtually devoid of documentary\nevidence supporting her assertions. Consequently, financial considerations security\nconcerns remain unmitigated. Due to a similar lack of documentation, personal conduct\nsecurity concerns remain unmitigated.\nThere are no facts bringing Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States into question.\nHer reliance on a less than comprehensive written record, however, leaves significant\nquestions unresolved. I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 29, 2008. She answered \nthe SOR in writing on November 6, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 10, \n2008, and I received the case assignment on December 15, 2008. DOHA issued the \nfirst Notice of Hearing on January 12, 2009, for a hearing scheduled for January 28, \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. A severe snow storm occurred that day, preventing her from driving to the hearing \nsite, and Applicant\u2019s request for a continuance was granted. On April 27, 2009, the \nsecond Notice of Hearing was issued by DOHA for a hearing on May 11, 2009. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 15, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until June 19, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On that day she \nsubmitted Exhibit C, without objection. The record closed on June 19, 2009. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in \u00b6 1 of \nthe SOR, with explanations, except \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, which she denied. She also provided \nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is single, has two children, ages 8 and 3, and is 27 years old.  She has \nan associate\u2019s degree in surgical technology, and works for a defense contractor in the \nhealth services business.  Her salary is $26,000 annually.  (Tr. 14-28, 59; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has 14 delinquent debts totaling $33,675.  She began having financial \ndifficulty in 2005 when she became pregnant with her second child.  She had to reduce \nher work hours at the restaurant where she worked, thereby decreasing her income.  At \nthe same time, her boyfriend lost his job, and found a job which paid him less than he \nearned previously.  They were renting a house at the time, bought new furniture, and \nother items.  When their income was reduced, Applicant and her boyfriend started living \noff their credit cards for the next seven months.  When their house lease ended, they \nmoved back into her parents\u2019 home.  Applicant took a year off work, from 2005 to 2006, \nafter her second child was born.  She borrowed $3,000 from her grandparents to rent \nanother house in September 2006.  She has repaid $1,800 of that debt.  Applicant \nseparated from her boyfriend in May 2007. Applicant was obligated on the debts after \nthe breakup of this relationship because she had the good credit previously which \nallowed them to make these purchases. She then lived with her parents until April 2008, \nwhen she obtained another rental home which she currently occupies. (Tr. 30-35, 47, \n66) \n \n \nApplicant has no credit cards now.  She pays her current monthly bills out of her \ngross monthly income of $2,050.  She receives child support of $250 from one former \nboyfriend, and $170 from the other father of her first child.  She used her 2008 tax \nrefund to pay her rent and child care expenses. (Tr. 70-76) \n \n \nApplicant owes $6,690 to a bank for a credit card debt (SOR Para. 1.a) which \nshe incurred when buying necessities when she was unemployed, dating from 2005.  \nThe bank obtained a judgment against her, and garnished her wages in the amount of \n$444 monthly.  That action caused Applicant to consult with a bankruptcy attorney and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nshe filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 18, 2009.  Her former boyfriend filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy on his share of their debts previously (Tr. 41, 48, 68, 79; Exhibits, 2-6, C) \n \n \nApplicant owes $145 to a cable television provider (SOR Para. 1.b) and another \n$262 to the same provider (SOR Para. 1.c).  These debts are unpaid, and Applicant has \nnot made any effort to repay them since they became delinquent in 2005. (Tr. 49, 50; \nExhibits 2-6) \n \n \nApplicant owes $375 to a satellite television provider (SOR Para. 1.d).  She has \nnot made any payments on this debt and it remains unpaid. (Tr. 50-52; Exhibits 2-6) \n \n \n \nApplicant owes debts on seven credit cards, dating from 2000 and later.  The \namounts are $6,583 (SOR Para. 1.e), $3,290 (SOR Para. 1.f), $2,970 (SOR Para. 1.g), \n$5,935 (SOR Para. 1.h), $775 (SOR Para. 1.i), $1,015 (SOR Para. 1.j), and $4,749 \n(SOR Para. 1.l).  None of these debts have been paid.  (Tr. 52-57; Exhibits 2-6) \n \n \nApplicant also owes $675 to a landlord for unpaid rent on the first house she and \nher former boyfriend rented (SOR Para. 1.k).  This debt remains unpaid.  (Tr. 56, 57; \nExhibits 2-6) \n \n \nApplicant owes $130 on an auto insurance policy on one of her former \nboyfriend\u2019s car (SOR Para. 1.m).  She has not paid anything on this debt. It has been \nowed since 2007. (Tr. 58; Exhibits 2-6) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s final delinquent debt listed in the SOR was for $81 owed to a \ntelephone company (SOR Para. 1.n).  She has not paid this debt after it became \ndelinquent in 2005. (Tr. 58; Exhibits 2-6)  \n \n \nApplicant answered the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Standard Form \n85P on May 24, 2007.  In response to Question 22 (b), which asked if she were over \n180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation, she answered \u201cno,\u201d although \nher delinquent debts listed in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e to 1.j, and 1.l to 1.n were more than 180 \ndays delinquent.  Applicant misunderstood the question and what her answer should be, \nbecause she was paying on her auto loan, which was the only loan she had.  Her other \ndebts she did not understand them to be loans or financial obligations.  Applicant is \ncredible in her explanation, based on her obvious lack of financial knowledge and \nsophistication. (Tr. 63; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 18, 2009.  Her total debt is listed in \nthe bankruptcy schedules at $39,129.30.  There are 19 debts listed in the bankruptcy \nschedule, whereas there are 14 debts listed in the SOR. (Exhibit C) \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters.  One letter is from her \nsupervisor which describes her as a top performer in the work unit.  The other letter is \nfrom a co-worker who has known and worked with her during the past four years.   She \ncharacterizes Applicant as hard-working, smart and intelligent, and a valuable employee \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto her organization.  Applicant has had no problems in her work location. (Tr. 80; \nExhibits A and B) \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes nine conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  Of these conditions, four are applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions demonstrate poor self-control and serious lack of financial \njudgment.  Her unpaid debts extending over several years, and her lack of any \nreasonable plan to repay them, are of serious trustworthiness concern. \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), Applicant has 14 delinquent debts totaling $33,675 listed in \nthe SOR.  She has not repaid any of them.  Applicant declared she does not have the \nmoney to repay these debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19 (b) applies because Applicant and her former boyfriend lived off her \ncredit cards when they were unemployed or underemployed.  She did not live within her \nincome, and instead  took money through the credit cards which she never had any \nability to repay based on her salary history of earning less than $30,000 annually. \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), she has not repaid any of these excessive debts.  \nShe has a four-year history of not making any payments on these debts. The debts go \nback to 2000. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n Applicant consistently spent beyond her means to repay the debt. Her debt \namount, her declared lack of funds to repay these debts and absence of interest in \nrepaying the debts, coupled with a high debt-to-income ratio, shows AG \u00b6 19 (e) is \napplicable.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline.  Of these six conditions, two apply to the Applicant\u2019s situation: \n \n (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand, \n \n (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by her second boyfriend who left her \nwith his child, and the debts they incurred while furnishing a rental home. Both of them \nlost their jobs in 2005, and suffered decreased incomes as they sought other \nemployment.  Applicant used her credit cards for current purchases while lacking the \nincome to repay those debts in a reasonable time period.  Applicant took no steps to \nrepay these debts in the past four years because of her low income and current \nexpenses.  Her former boyfriend has not helped her repay any of the debts he incurred \nwith her, and in fact, was discharged in bankruptcy of his obligations for these debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) has limited applicability. \n \n \nApplicant initiated the Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding to eliminate her debts \nafter one credit card creditor obtained a judgment against her, and garnished her \nwages.  The garnishment created a large hole in her monthly income which she used to \nsupport herself and her two children.  She was compelled to move quickly to resolve \nthese 14 debts by the bankruptcy proceeding.  It was the only legal method she had \navailable to resolve the debts, because her income would never have allowed her to \nrepay any of these debts. AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying.  One of these conditions applies to Applicant\u2019s situation: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose on her SF 85P, the Trustworthiness Application, that \nshe had multiple debts delinquent longer than 180 days.  However, she did not \nunderstand the total nature of the question asked, thinking it referred only to her car \nloan.  She had no other loans outstanding at the time.  The phrase \u201cfinancial \nobligations\u201d contained in the question did not seem to Applicant to refer to the debts \nlisted now in the SOR.  After hearing Applicant\u2019s testimony, and observing her \ndemeanor and lack of financial sophistication, coupled with her focus on caring for her \nchildren amidst her tumultuous personal life, I find her explanation credible.  She did not \ndeliberately mislead the Government, but was innocently confused.  Because there is \nno deliberate falsification, there need not be any mitigating conditions applied.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was involved first with one man by whom she had a child.  Then, she became \ninvolved with another man by whom she had another child.  During that relationship, \nthey incurred debts furnishing a rental home for their family unit, and became financially \ndelinquent. Both suffered loss of employment in the 2004-2006 time periods.  Applicant \nwas left with the debts after the breakup of the second relationship because she had the \ncredit in the past which allowed them to make these purchases.  She has not had the \nincome to repay the debts, and could never repay them based on her salary history.  \nUsing credit cards for living expenses is irresponsible action, but Applicant explained \nshe had no other recourse.  She has now stopped that type of conduct, has no credit \ncards, and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy to resolve the debts.  The bankruptcy is a legal \nmeans to resolve her debts.  Caring for her children motivated her spending habits, and \ntrying to live a middle-class life on a lower-than-middle class income also motivated her \nspending.  With the bankruptcy filing, there is no likelihood of recurrence because \nApplicant has undergone a behavior change, living on a cash basis only.  The \nhumiliation of having to explain herself at a hearing also motivates her not to repeat her \npast conduct.  She obviously only wants to live in peace, do her job, and care for her \nchildren.  I am also persuaded by the comments submitted by her supervisor and her \nfriend who is her co-worker. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a trustworthiness determination. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct issues.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old male working for a defense contractor. He started working for his present employer in January 2007 in a temporary capacity, then became a full-time employee in January 2008. He has a high school diploma and completed two years of college. Married, he has two grown children and one 17-year-old child. In his Answer to the SOR, dated November 11, 2008, Applicant admitted all factual allegations raised in paragraph 1 regarding finances (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m). He denied the allegation set forth under paragraph 2 regarding personal conduct (\u00b6 2.a). At age 18, after completing high school, Applicant joined the military. At age 24, he married his wife. At the time, she was having financial difficulties, so Applicant helped her manage her finances. This became a pattern, with her getting into debt and him helping her out. Applicant was honorably discharged in 1994 owing to a disability. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s spending pattern became out of control in the early 2000s, by which time he could no longer stay current on both their obligations. Once, around 2002 or 2003, she purchased a new car to replace a 2000 model vehicle. He reluctantly signed as a cosigner on the purchase. Within a few days, he realized the purchase was a mistake. Applicant also concluded the car was unreliable. He tried to return it to the dealer. The dealer would not accept the car, however, and stated it belonged to the credit union that financed the purchase. Applicant left th",

On October 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nregarding Applicant arising under Guideline F and Guideline E. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 11, 2008, admitting all 13\nallegations under Guideline F and denying the single allegation raised under Guideline\nE. He also requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the\nrequest on January 2, 2009, and it was assigned to an Administrative Judge. A hearing\nwas convened on February 5, 2009, at which Applicant requested a continuance for\nvalid personal reasons. Without objection, the continuance was granted. The case was\nJune 29, 2009\n\n      Tr. 8.\n1\n2\ntransferred to me on March 4, 2009, for caseload considerations. Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel agreed on a hearing date of April 2, 2009. A notice of hearing was\nissued on March 16, 2009, to that effect. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted what has been accepted as Exhibits\nA through E without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nuntil April 17, 2009, to submit additional matters. On April 14, 2009, he submitted what\nhas been accepted as Exhibits F-I without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on April 17, 2009. The record was then closed. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, it was unclear as to when Applicant received the Notice of\nHearing. I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days\nnotice before the hearing. Applicant effectively waived his right to 15 days notice.  \n1\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old male working for a defense contractor. He started\nworking for his present employer in January 2007 in a temporary capacity, then became\na full-time employee in January 2008. He has a high school diploma and completed two\nyears of college. Married, he has two grown children and one 17-year-old child. In his\nAnswer to the SOR, dated November 11, 2008, Applicant admitted all factual\nallegations raised in paragraph 1 regarding finances (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m). He denied\nthe allegation set forth under paragraph 2 regarding personal conduct (\u00b6 2.a).\nAt age 18, after completing high school, Applicant joined the military. At age 24,\nhe married his wife. At the time, she was having financial difficulties, so Applicant\nhelped her manage her finances. This became a pattern, with her getting into debt and\nhim helping her out. Applicant was honorably discharged in 1994 owing to a disability. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s spending pattern became out of control in the early 2000s, by\nwhich time he could no longer stay current on both their obligations. Once, around 2002\nor 2003, she purchased a new car to replace a 2000 model vehicle. He reluctantly\nsigned as a cosigner on the purchase. Within a few days, he realized the purchase was\na mistake. Applicant also concluded the car was unreliable. He tried to return it to the\ndealer. The dealer would not accept the car, however, and stated it belonged to the\ncredit union that financed the purchase. Applicant left the car at the credit union, which\nlater told him it belonged to Applicant and his wife. The most the credit union offered to\ndo was auction the car, leaving the couple responsible for the difference. \n\n      Tr. 18.\n2\n      Tr. 20.\n3\n      Tr. 27, 32.\n4\n      Tr. 32.\n5\n      Tr. 30. Note: At Tr. 32, a typographical error in the transcript states allegation 1.f is a duplicate of\n6\n\u201c1O.\u201d There is no \u201c1O\u201d allegation.\n      Tr. 33-34.\n7\n      Ex. F (Financial counseling letter, dated Apr. 7, 2009).\n8\n3\nThe following year, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s 2000 vehicle began having automotive\nproblems. They bought her a 2002 car and Applicant assumed the payments on her\ntroublesome 2000 vehicle. In 2005, she damaged the 2002 automobile in an accident.\nOn her own initiative, after various attempts to have the car repaired, Applicant\u2019s wife\nbought a 2005 model vehicle. This left Applicant making payments on both the 2000\nand 2002 vehicles. \nThe 2002 automobile was repossessed in 2005. The 2000 car was then totaled\nin an accident while driven by Applicant\u2019s son. In the interim, Applicant found it\nimpossible to pay rent on an apartment in another region where he was going to school,\nmake his house and car payments, and pay for insurance on all of the vehicles. His wife\nagreed to get insurance coverage for the cars, but only obtained coverage for herself\nand their son. Although financially responsible for the wrecked 2000 vehicle, the\ninsurance company would not work with him because he was not one of the insured\nunder his wife\u2019s policy. He never learned what became of the vehicle.  \n2\nAt some point in 2005, Applicant was let go from his job at a mill. Unemployed,\nhe went to college for a year in another state. When he returned home, he found work\nat an automobile restoration business. He was a valued employee, but was eventually\nlaid off.  In 2006, his wife left him and moved out of state with their teenage son. In the\n3\nsummer of 2007, he started working for his current employer as a temporary employee.\nA year later he was promoted to full-time permanent status.\nAt issue are 11 delinquent debts and 2 judgments, noted in the SOR as\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m. They represent approximately $51,000 of debt.\nAllegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are duplicate entries representing the same debt.4\nAllegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h are duplicate entries representing the same account.5\nAllegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.m are also duplicate entries representing the same account.6\nApplicant does not recognize the telecommunications entity noted in \u00b6 1.g and denies\never having had service with that company. He also denies knowledge of the entity\nnoted in allegation \u00b6 1.i.  He is working on having these accounts formally disputed with\n7\nhis financial counselor.  Allegation \u00b6 1.k represents emergency medical care not\n8\n\n      Tr. 36-37; Ex. G (Medical query and receipt).\n9\n      Tr. 25. Applicant made two $25 monthly payments in 2007.

Subtracting these duplicates and disputes, the amount at issue is about\n9\n$32,000.\nApplicant has made some actual progress making payments on a judgment\nowed a credit union, noted in allegation 1.j (judgment for approximately $1,471 entered\nabout November 2005).  Regarding allegations \u00b6\u00b6 F and M, duplicate accounts,\n10\nApplicant has negotiated a settlement of 50% of the $365.82 balance now pending.  \n11\nApplicant earns $8.75 an hour, working 40 hours per week. He is paid every two\nweeks. His monthly net is about $1,070 on a total compensation package worth\napproximately $16,000 per year. When he can, Applicant sends money to his 17-year-\nold son, who lives with a disability. Applicant\u2019s personal needs are minimal and he lives\na simple lifestyle. He is currently living within his income. He pays $635 a month for a\nplace to live and about $175 a month for food. His utilities are approximately $120 a\nmonth. He has no land line, internet, or cable, relying instead on a $39.99 a month cell\nphone. He drives a 21-year-old car that is paid off. His auto insurance is paid and he\nspends about $25 a week on gasoline. Applicant tithes at his church approximately\n$350 a month.  He has received financial counseling and is considering getting help\n12\nthrough a credit counseling service. His financial counselor cautions that having the\nVeterans Administration pay his medical balance and having duplicate accounts\ndeleted from his credit report will \u201ctake some time.\u201d  \n13\nAt work, Applicant is praised for his performance and maturity.  His overall\n14\nreview rating is \u201cSometimes Exceeds Expectations,\u201d a ranking between \u201cMeets\nExpectations\u201d and \u201cConsistently Exceeds Expectations.\u201d  When documenting his\n15\nhonorable discharge from the military, it was noted that he had received several\ndecorations, medals, and ribbons to his credit.  \n16\n\n      Tr. 55-56.\n17\n      Tr. 56-59, noting, for example, that Applicant thought a charge-off meant a debt was \u201cwiped out.\u201d\n18\n      Tr. 63.\n19\n      Tr. 60, noting the Government\u2019s closing argument.\n20\n5\nIn executing his public trust questionnaires, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a\nquestion asking whether he was over 180 day delinquent on any debts. It was not his\nintention to be dishonest.  He was unclear about the question and unaware that he had\n17\nexistent debt.  In his closing, Applicant noted: \u201cThe one thing that I\u2019ve learned from the\n18\nmilitary service, be responsible, accept responsibility for your actions. And with that\nsaid, if the statement that I signed checking no [is incorrect], then I\u2019m responsible for\nthat. So I will accept responsibility however you decide, sir.\u201d  Prior to financial\n19\ncounseling, Applicant lacked sophistication with regard to finances.  \n20\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, mostly between\n2002 and 2006. Thus far he has been unable to pay most of his delinquent obligations.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\n\n7\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose between about 2002 and 2006, a period\nduring which he testified he could no longer stay abreast of his now estranged wife\u2019s\nspending. As examples, he points to her automotive dealings. He also cites to personal\nemergency medical needs and to a child with physical special needs. With his wife and\nnearly 18-year-old son now physically in a distant state, and Applicant\u2019s medical care\notherwise provided through the V.A., these circumstances are no longer existent. I find\nthe behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and\nit does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some\nof the financial problems arose from his wife=s expenditures, from medical necessity,\nand periods of unemployment. Throughout, Applicant continuously tried to keep his\nwife\u2019s spending under control, stay employed, and meet his obligations. He generally\nacted responsibly, trying to curb his wife\u2019s spending and resolve situations in which her\nautomotive acquisitions exceeded their income. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c), given Applicant\u2019s recent financial counseling,\ninitial efforts to dispute the multiple erroneous entries on his credit report, and obtain\nsettlements. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ In\naddition to the aforementioned, Applicant has already received one settlement offer\nafter his financial counseling, resumed repayment on one account, and has referred his\nmedical bill to the V.A. for reconsideration. Although significant strides have not been\nmade, he has shown a good faith effort in light of the minimal income his current\nemployment provides. This mitigating condition applies in part.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set\nout in AG & 15: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation. Here, Applicant denied having any debts delinquent over 180 days on his\nSF-85P. Vague as to the meaning of the question, and unaware his past obligations\nwere covered by the term \u201cdelinquent debt,\u201d he answered no to the applicable question.\nApplicant\u2019s own direct testimony and that elicited by Department Counsel demonstrate\nApplicant\u2019s lack of sophistication with regard to financial terminology. Given his credible\ntestimony throughout the proceeding, there is no indication of falsity on his part. This\nguideline does not apply.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a straight-forward and\ndirect man who openly takes full responsibility for his financial failures. His demeanor\nand credible testimony reflect his military experience. His testimony provides a direct\nlink between his estranged wife\u2019s spending habits and financial commitments between\n2002 and 2006 and much of his current delinquent debt. Despite his best efforts over\nthe years to rehabilitate her financial situation, the efforts only served to worsen his\nown. \nWith his estranged wife now residing in a distant state supporting herself, and his\nyoungest son on the verge of adulthood, Applicant is no longer acquiring debt, is living\nwithin his means, and is now free to focus on his own finances. He did not rush into\nbankruptcy, preferring instead to honor his obligations himself. He recognized that he\nlacked financial savvy and sought financial counseling. Applicant is now considering\ncredit counseling, as well. While significant debt remains, he has made some important\nfirst steps in addressing his delinquent debt. \nIn terms of wages, Applicant\u2019s salary is relatively low. This is not unusual in\ntrustworthiness determinations. To his credit, however, Applicant is noted for his\nprofessionalism, maturity, and productivity on the job. His appraisals demonstrate he is\nreliable, trustworthy, and able to protect sensitive information at work. These facts\nindicate he is a good candidate for his position, a position offering the financial stability\nand longevity needed to complete his financial rehabilitation. Now living safely and\ncomfortably within his income, Applicant\u2019s military diligence and personal sense of\nhonor should continue to inspire him to persist in the resolution of his delinquent debt\nand the deletion of errors on his credit report. The notion he would engage in illegal\nacts to generate income is antithetical to his core beliefs regarding personal\nresponsibility, both expressed and demonstrated. Overall, the record evidence leaves\nme without questions or serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\npublic trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal\nconduct. Access is granted.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains seven allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g.); he denied two allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 19-20, 28-31, 35-46, 55-63.) Applicant is 54 years old and a high school graduate. He has been married to his wife for 34 years. They are the parents of five adult children. All of Applicant\u2019s children are self-supporting, although he provides some financial help to a daughter who has three children. Applicant\u2019s annual gross salary is approximately $41,000. His wife\u2019s annual gross salary is about $25,000. Applicant also receives about $13,000 annually in military retirement pay. His total gross annual household income is approximately $80,000. (Tr. 25-27, 73-74.) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. military at age 18 and served for 20 years. He held a security clearance while in the military. He retired in 1992. (Tr. 25-26, 89-90; Ex. 1.) Since his retirement, Applicant has held a number of civilian jobs. From June 1992 to December 1992, he worked as a sales associate. From December 1992 until November 1995, he was a computer helpdesk technician. From December 1995 to February 2003, he was employed as a contract computer technician.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(EQIP) Questionnaire on January 23, 2008. On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 25, \nOctober 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n2008. I convened a hearing on September 22, 2008 to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced two exhibits, which \nwere identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A and B and admitted to the record \nwithout objection.1   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness September 29, 2008, so that Applicant could provide additional information for \nthe record. Applicant timely filed a document clarifying his employment between \nDecember 1992 and November 1995 and two of his personal checking account \nstatements. I marked Applicant\u2019s additional submissions as his Ex. C, D, and E, and \nthey were admitted to the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \nof the hearing on September 26, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains seven allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.)  In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted five of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g.); he denied \ntwo allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of \nfact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 19-20, 28-31, 35-46, 55-63.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and a high school graduate. He has been married to his \nwife for 34 years.  They are the parents of five adult children.  All of Applicant\u2019s children \nare self-supporting, although he provides some financial help to a daughter who has \nthree children. Applicant\u2019s annual gross salary is approximately $41,000.  His wife\u2019s \nannual gross salary is about $25,000. Applicant also receives about $13,000 annually in \nmilitary retirement pay.  His total gross annual household income is approximately \n$80,000. (Tr. 25-27, 73-74.) \n \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. military at age 18 and served for 20 years.  He held \na security clearance while in the military. He retired in 1992. (Tr. 25-26, 89-90; Ex. 1.) \n \n \nSince his retirement, Applicant has held a number of civilian jobs.  From June \n1992 to December 1992, he worked as a sales associate. From December 1992 until \nNovember 1995, he was a computer helpdesk technician. From December 1995 to \nFebruary 2003, he was employed as a contract computer technician. He earned about \n$42,000 a year in that job.  (Tr. 30-31.) \n \n \n1 While the Government did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s Ex. B, Counsel noted that Applicant \nhad previously submitted the document identified as Ex. B in response to DOHA interrogatories on June \n19, 2008. (Ex. 3 at 9.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant\u2019s wife became ill, required surgery, and lost her job.  Applicant \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) In May 1996, the \nbankruptcy court discharged approximately $14,000 in debts owed by Applicant and his \nwife. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health improved, and, with a few exceptions, she has been \nsteadily employed since the end of 1996.  (Tr. 28-30, 69-70; Ex. 6.) \n \n \nFor about 3\u00bd years between 2003 and September 2006, Applicant had a series \nof short-term jobs as a contractor.  In September 2006, he began to work as a computer \ntechnician for his present employer, a government contractor. His job requires a security \nclearance.  (Tr. 30-32.) \n \n \nIn 1993, Applicant and his wife purchased a home. In 2004, they sold the home \nand realized a profit of about $41,000. They did not purchase another home, but used \nsome of the proceeds from the sale of their house to pay credit card debt.  (Tr. 33-34.) \n \n \nIn 1999 and 2000, Applicant opened two credit card accounts with the same \ncreditor. He defaulted on these accounts in about 2004, and both accounts were placed \nfor collection. These accounts are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR. The \ndelinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. is approximately $4,515. The delinquency alleged at \nSOR 1.b. is approximately $2,707. Applicant entered into a judgment agreement with \nthe creditor on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. The judgment entered against Applicant \nreduced the debt to $2,500, and he agreed to pay the creditor $25 a month, with interest \ncontinuing to accrue. Applicant believes he has paid about $600 on the debt, and he \nestimates it will take him approximately 80 months to pay off the principal amount of the \ndebt.  He has taken no action to pay the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 37-42.) \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied he had not satisfied a delinquent \nmedical debt of approximately $492 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. He provided a cancelled \ncheck for $60, $30 of which he claimed was related to the medical debt alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. He also provided documentation that showed insurance payments of $445.  At his \nhearing, he stated he had recently paid a balance due of $20 on the account. He failed \nto provide documentation to show that his payments were directly related to the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. or that the debt had been satisfied in full. (Ex. 3 at 8, 9; Ex. B; Tr. \n60-63.) \n \n \nApplicant also denied a debt in collection status alleged at SOR \u00b61.e. He claimed \nthat the debt of approximately $205 to an electric company had been satisfied. In a \npost-hearing submission, Applicant provided copies of his bank statement corroborating \nthat the debt had been satisfied by a payment of $104.50 on April 9, 2008, and a \npayment of $105.28 0n May 12, 2008. (Tr. 55-60; Ex. D; Ex. E.)  \n \n \nIn the last seven years, Applicant has purchased a number of automobiles. In \n2001, he acquired a loan of $27,000 to purchase an automobile. In 2005, the \nautomobile was voluntarily repossessed and sold, leaving a deficiency balance of \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n$7,000.2 In 2002, he borrowed $33,000 to purchase a vehicle for his wife. He was \nunable to make the monthly loan payments on the vehicle, and it was also voluntarily \nrepossessed in 2005. After it was sold by the creditor, Applicant owed a deficiency \nbalance of approximately $13,000, which he did not pay. The debt grew to \napproximately $14,400, was placed for collection, and was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. The \ndebt remains unsatisfied.  (Tr.  42-46.) \n \n \nIn October 2005, Applicant purchased another vehicle with a loan of   \napproximately $20,000.  Applicant\u2019s monthly payments on this vehicle are $470. In May \n2007, Applicant borrowed $10,000 to purchase another vehicle for his wife. In February \n2008, he traded that vehicle to a dealer, and took out another loan of $25,000 to \npurchase still another vehicle. His monthly payments on his most recently-acquired \nvehicle are $485.  (Tr. 48-52.) \n \n \nIn June 19, 2008, Applicant responded to financial interrogatories sent to him by \nDOHA.  In a personal financial statement, he reported his net monthly income as $2,340 \nand his wife\u2019s net monthly income as $1,630. He also reported that each month he \nreceived $1,019 in military retirement pay. His total net monthly income was $4,989.  \nAfter subtracting his monthly living expenses, Applicant had $20 remaining at the end of \neach month. He reported he had owned no real estate and had no savings. At his \nhearing, Applicant reported an increase of $54 in his net monthly salary, making his \ntotal net monthly income $5,043.  (Ex. 3; Ex. A.) \n \n \nApplicant listed his monthly expenses in a personal financial statement he \nprepared for his hearing as follows: rent: $1,220; utilities, cable and internet: $578; \npayments on loans for his two automobiles: $952; medical insurance: $226; car \ninsurance: $370; gas at $4.00 per gallon: $512; automobile repairs and upkeep: $30; \nclothing: $100; groceries: $800; miscellaneous: $125; and payment of debt identified at \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. These expenses left him with a monthly remainder of $41.  He indicated he \ncould cut some of his costs by spending about $270 less for gasoline, $50 less for \nclothing, and $200 less for groceries. He noted he no longer paid $64 a month for his \nson\u2019s orthodontia. Applicant acknowledged that his monthly expenses related to paying \nfor, operating, and insuring his automobiles were approximately $1,900 or 38% of his \nmonthly income. (Ex. A; Tr. 74-78)  \n \n \nApplicant has not had financial credit counseling. He has lived from paycheck to \npaycheck for most of his life.  (Tr. 85, 89.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 This debt was not alleged on the SOR and is included only to show Applicant\u2019s pattern of debt \nacquisition to purchase automobiles. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g.,loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from  \nat least 1996, when he declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy, to the present time. While his \nwife fell ill and required surgery in 1996, she recovered and was back at work by the \nend of 1996.  Applicant and his wife have, for the most part, been steadily employed \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsince he retired from the military in 1992. Their annual income, including his military \npension, is approximately $80,000. \n \n Applicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had paid a debt of \n$205, alleged at SOR \u00b61.e.  He failed to provide documentation to prove that he had \nsatisfied a medical debt of $492, alleged at SOR \u00b61.d. He provided documentation to \nshow he had entered into a settlement agreement to pay the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. $25 a month, plus accruing interest, on a debt of $2,500, an arrangement that will \ncost him money in interest and not retire the debt for many years. He acknowledged two \ndebts, totaling almost $19,000, but has made no arrangements to pay those debts.   \n \nApplicant had not received financial counseling. While he admitted his financial \ndelinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial problems or how to \nresolve them. He was financially over-extended, had no savings, and had very little \nmoney left at the end of each month. Nearly 40% of his income went to maintain, \noperate, and insure his two automobiles. He had no plan in place to systematically \nresolve his substantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude \nthat none of the Financial Consideration mitigating conditions apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person of 54 \nyears. His financial problems began at least 12 years ago. During that time, he has lived \nfrom one paycheck to another.  Despite an annual income of $80,000, he has not taken \naffirmative action to live within his means and to pay or resolve his substantial \ndelinquent debts. His lack of attention to his financial delinquencies continues to raise \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsecurity concerns. He has borrowed large sums of money to purchase automobiles.  \nNearly 40% of his monthly income goes to pay his automobile loans and to maintain \nand insure his automobiles. Despite a steady income for several years, he failed to \nbudget his income to satisfy his many other debts. Instead, he continued on a pattern of \nover-extension, which, in the past, led to vehicle repossessions. He has a low net \nremainder at the end of every month, and he has no savings, raising concerns about his \njudgment and potential financial vulnerability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It was also alleged that Applicant traveled to Iran in 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and that Applicant has in Iran a bank account containing about $30,000 and a vested real estate interest worth about $20,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted with explanation each of these allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 49 years old and has been employed since October 1998 by a large defense contractor for work in the satellite communications field. He has worked in that field for almost 20 years, but his work has not required a security clearance until now. His Facility Security Officer (FSO) has known Applicant for about 10 years. He recommends Applicant for a position of trust based on daily contact with him over the entire time Applicant has worked for their company. (SF 86; Tr., 55, 62) The government did not allege this fact under Guideline C (AG 9 - Foreign Preference), ostensibly because 4 Applicant\u2019s FSO has custody of Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport and has agreed to notify the government if Applicant asks for it s return so he can travel to Iran.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert G. Schwalls, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn July 3, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his\nemployment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of and/or\n1\nadditional information about potentially disqualifying information in his background. After\nreviewing the results of the background investigation and his responses to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nJune 24, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, these guidelines supercede those contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to\n2\nclassified information. On November 10, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline B (foreign influence).\n3\nOn December 15, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a\nhearing. On January 14, 2009, Department Counsel made a pre-hearing submission\nthrough which the government asked that administrative notice be taken of certain facts\ngermane to the issues presented by the pleadings. The submission consisted of a nine-\npage memorandum supported by 17 enclosed documents (Attachments I - XVII).\nThe case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009, and I convened a hearing\non April 1, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009. The\nparties appeared at the hearing as scheduled. The government presented three exhibits\n\u2013 Applicant\u2019s e-QIP (Gx. 1) and his responses to interrogatories (Gx. 2 and 3). They\nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and presented one\nwitness. \nI also granted the government\u2019s pre-hearing administrative notice request. The\nentire administrative notice request is included in the record as Judicial Exhibit (Jx. 1);\nhowever, for reasons discussed at the hearing (Tr. 16 - 19), I have not considered the\ninformation contained in Jx. 1, Attachments XII and XXIV - XVII.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline B, the government alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nfour sisters (SOR \u00b6 1.b), two brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.c), fiancee (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and her\nimmediate family members (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are all citizens of and reside in Iran. It was also\nalleged that Applicant traveled to Iran in 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and\nthat Applicant has in Iran a bank account containing about $30,000 and a vested real\nestate interest worth about $20,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant admitted with explanation\neach of these allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions\nin response to the SOR, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old and has been employed since October 1998 by a large\ndefense contractor for work in the satellite communications field. He has worked in that\nfield for almost 20 years, but his work has not required a security clearance until now.\nHis Facility Security Officer (FSO) has known Applicant for about 10 years. He\nrecommends Applicant for a position of trust based on daily contact with him over the\nentire time Applicant has worked for their company. (SF 86; Tr., 55, 62) \n\n The government did not allege this fact under Guideline C (AG 9 - Foreign Preference), ostensibly because\n4\nApplicant\u2019s FSO has custody of Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport and has agreed to notify the government if\nApplicant asks for it s return so he can travel to Iran. (Tr., 42 - 43, 55 - 57)\n3\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. In 1978, he came to the United States for\nhis undergraduate degree. However, in 1980, out of concern about Iranian government\nactions that might affect his father after Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution, Applicant returned to\nIran. Before he could leave the country to complete his college education in the United\nStates, Applicant was required to complete two years of military service required of all\nIranian citizens. He served in the Iranian Army from 1982 until 1984. He returned to the\nUnited States in 1985. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr. 45)\nApplicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in June 2006. He has a U.S.\npassport, but also maintains an Iranian passport that he has held since 1978.  (Gx. 1;\n4\nGx. 2; Gx. 3) He married a native-born U.S. citizen in June 1986. The marriage\nproduced two sons (now ages 19 and 13), but ended in divorce in January 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s children were both born in the United States and have never been to Iran.\nThe older child attends a U.S. college on a military Reserve Officer Training Corps\n(ROTC) scholarship. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr., 12)\nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings are Iranian citizens. With one exception, they\nall live in Iran, as do his extended family members (cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.).\nApplicant has one older brother and two older sisters, and two younger sisters and one\nyounger brother. His younger brother recently came to the United States and is now a\npermanent resident alien here. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr. 51) Applicant\u2019s mother is an\nelderly widow who still lives in the house where she and her late husband raised their\nchildren. She has visited Applicant in the United States and has Permanent Resident\nAlien Status. However, her last visit was in 2001 and for health reasons she is not likely\nto travel outside of Iran. Applicant speaks to his mother by phone two or three times\nmonthly. (Tr., 24 - 25, 26)\nWhen Applicant\u2019s father died in 2000, Applicant received a per capita interest in\nthe family house. He also received a monetary bequest worth about $30,000. Applicant\nestimates the combined inheritance is worth about $50,000, which is less than half his\nannual income in the U.S.. Applicant estimates the current net worth of his assets and\nliabilities in the U.S. to be about $700,000. The money he received from his father is\nkept in an Iranian bank. Applicant does not need the money, but he understands that it\nis difficult to transfer funds out of the country and possibly illegal to transfer it to the\nUnited States. He has left it in an Iranian bank for his family to draw on when necessary.\n(Answer to SOR; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr., 27 - 30, 53 - 54)\nApplicant re-married in March 2009. His wife was born and raised in Iran and is\nan Iranian citizen. She arrived in the United States in January 2009 on a fiancee visa\nand has applied for permanent resident alien status. Applicant and his wife were\nintroduced through family members in March 2007 and met for the first time in Iran in\nMay 2007. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents, siblings and extended family are all citizens of and\nreside in Iran. She contacts her parents by phone or e-mail a few times each month.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n4\nApplicant\u2019s contact with them is less frequent. None of his or his wife\u2019s family are\nemployed by or have any official ties to the Iranian government. (Gx. 2; Tr., 25, 39 - 41)\nApplicant travels to Iran to visit his mother and the rest of his family about every\nthree years. His last visit was in 2007. He intends to return to Iran to see his mother. His\nwife also intends to travel to Iran to see her family. (Gx. 3; Tr., 42 - 43, 46)\nIn 1979, the Shah of Iran was overthrown in favor of a theocratic government\nbased on Islamic law. Despite occasional gains by more moderate Muslim clerics in the\ngovernment, the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) remains under the control of\nfundamentalists dedicated to a repressive form of government in furtherance of strict\nadherence to the Koran. Iran\u2019s regime has amassed a dismal human rights record.\nGovernment entities have been involved in an increased number of abductions,\nsummary executions, disappearance, torture, and other unacceptable practices\ndesigned to preserve the government\u2019s hold over its citizens. The State Department has\nalso advised U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran, and has noted instances whereby dual\nU.S.-Iranian citizens have been singled out for special monitoring and detention. (Jx. I,\nAttachments I - VI) Applicant and his FSO both testified that they are aware of the\nadverse relationship between Iran and the United States. His FSO has concerns about\nsecurity risks associated with travel to Iran. (Tr., 65, 73)\nIran\u2019s global interests are directly antithetical to those of the U.S.. To further their\nregional and global goals, Iran has become an active collector of economic information\nand has an active espionage service which targets U.S. interests and information. Iran\nis also an active sponsor of terrorism, which targets the interests of the U.S. and its\nallies. Finally, the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons\nof mass destruction by Iran is seen by the U.S. as a major threat to regional and\npossibly global stability. (Jx. I, Attachments VII - XI, XIII)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 6, Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence. \nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the factual\nallegations in the SOR. Those allegations, which Applicant also admits, raise security\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s personal relationships and other interests in Iran.\nSpecifically, as stated in AG \u00b6 6, \n[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\n6\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nThe facts presented through SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.e require application of the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion). With the exception of his younger brother, who is a\nU.S. permanent resident alien, Applicant\u2019s entire family are citizens of and reside in\nIran. His wife\u2019s entire family are also citizens of and reside in Iran. Applicant\u2019s wife is an\nIranian citizen who arrived in the U.S. in January 2009 and is in the U.S. solely on a\nfiancee/spouse visa. These facts must be considered together with information that\nshows Iran to be hostile to U.S. interests, a state sponsor of international terror aimed at\nU.S. interests, an active aggressive collector of U.S. economic and industrial\ninformation, and that Iran\u2019s poor human rights record includes state targeting of U.S. -\nIranian citizens traveling in Iran. All of the available information bearing on this issue\nshows that Applicant\u2019s family ties in Iran create a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a).\nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.g, available information supports this allegation, but the security\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s partial interest in the family home and the money he has left\nin an Iranian bank account is minimal. It is not certain that Applicant will both outlive his\nmother and/or that he will actually take possession of any part of the family home. As to\nthe bank account, Applicant does not need the funds and it makes sense, given the\nprobable difficulty or illegality of trying to transfer that money out of Iran, to leave it in an\naccount for his family to use. Further, the amount in question is insignificant when\ncompared to Applicant\u2019s estimated net worth. To be disqualifying, it must be shown that\nthese interests constitute \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a\nforeign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could\nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 7(e);\nemphasis added) While it may be the case that Applicant is concerned about Iranian\npressure against his family should he try to move the money from his account to the\nU.S., it is more likely that the decision to leave the money in an Iranian bank was borne\nmore of practicality than anything else. SOR \u00b6 1.g is concluded for the Applicant.\nOf the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 8, only AG \u00b6 8(a), AG \u00b6 8(b), AG \u00b6\n8(c), and  AG \u00b6 8(f) are potentially applicable to these facts. As to \u00b6 AG 8(a)(the nature\nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.), none of Applicant\u2019s or his wife\u2019s family have any official ties to or are\nemployed by the Iranian government. However, I have also considered the aggressive\nnature of the Iranian government against U.S. interests and, at times, against its own\npeople. When coupled with the obvious closeness of Applicant\u2019s family ties in Iran,\n\n7\nthese facts present an unacceptable risk that Applicant could be forced to choose\nbetween his obligation to protect U.S. classified information and the interests of his\nfamily in Iran. Thus, this mitigating condition does not apply.\nAs to AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest), Applicant has longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. He\nhas been here on a permanent basis for about 25 years, and he has two U.S.-born\nchildren from a 20-year marriage to a native-born American. He has worked in U.S.\nindustry for about 20 years, and his financial interests in the United States far exceed\nhis Iranian financial interests. However, these interests are directly counterbalanced by\nApplicant\u2019s close ties in Iran, his maintenance of an Iranian passport for future travel,\nand the new ties of affection he has established through his recent marriage to an\nIranian citizen. While the government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s foreign travel\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) is not by itself disqualifying, it is evidence of the influence of his relationship\nwith his family in Iran. On balance, Applicant has not satisfied his burden of persuasion\nwith respect to application of AG \u00b6 8(b).\nFurther, Applicant has not presented sufficient information to warrant application\nof AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation). Applicant\u2019s ties to his family and, by virtue of his affection for his wife, to\nher family are presumed to be close. Also, Applicant and his wife have frequent contact\neach month with their parents, and they have and will likely continue to travel to Iran\nperiodically to visit in person. These facts preclude application of AG \u00b6 8(c).\nFinally, for the reasons discussed above regarding Applicant\u2019s Iranian bank\naccount and property interest, it is unnecessary to consider AG \u00b6 8(f) (the value or\nroutine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they\nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual). In summary, the government\u2019s information about\nApplicant\u2019s personal contacts in Iran is sufficient to raise reasonable security concerns\nabout whether Applicant\u2019s ability to protect the U.S. national interest unhindered by\nforeign influences. In response, Applicant failed to meet his burden of showing either\nthat those contacts do not pose a risk of undue pressure, coercion or manipulation by\ntheir presence in Iran, or that his interests, relationships and loyalties in the United\nStates sufficiently outweigh that risk. With the exception of his financial interests in Iran,\nI conclude Applicant has not met his burden. Accordingly, having considered all of the\navailable information bearing on the issue of possible foreign preference, Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate this security concern.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines B. I have also reviewed the record before me in\nthe context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature,\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n8\nresponsible, and highly accomplished 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor\nwith several years of experience in the satellite communications industry. He has lived,\nstudied and worked in the U.S. for most of the past 30 years. His children and his ex-\nwife of 20 years are native-born in the U.S. and most of his financial and personal\ninterests are in the United States. However, throughout his life in the United States,\nApplicant has actively maintained his family ties in Iran through his travel and other\nfrequent contact. He has also recently added new foreign ties through his second\nmarriage, this time to an Iranian citizen who has only recently moved to the U.S. Those\nties to Iranian citizens are presumed to be close as well. Future travel to Iran in\nfurtherance of his family ties is likely and indicates a continued division of personal\ninterests between the U.S. and Iran, a country hostile to the U.S.. \nThere has been no misconduct here. Nor is there anything inappropriate or illegal\nabout Applicant\u2019s interests overseas. However, in the context of deciding whether to\nallow him access to classified information, Applicant\u2019s circumstances place on him the\nheavy burden of demonstrating that he would not be vulnerable to coercion by the\nIranian government or that he would not be compromised by conflicting interests in Iran.\nInsofar as it is unlikely that Applicant\u2019s circumstances will change in the foreseeable\nfuture, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information shows\n9\nApplicant has not overcome the doubts these circumstances raise about his suitability\nfor access to classified information. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.10\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 12, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge.

She was born in Taiwan and came \nto the U.S. in December 1994 to attend a master\u2019s degree program at an American \nuniversity. She met her husband while attending the program. He was also from Taiwan \nand came to the U.S. in 1994 to attend school. They married in 1996 and have a son \nwho was born in the U.S. in 2000. After she completed her master\u2019s degree in \nInformation Systems Management she remained in the U.S. to acquire practical \ntraining. She was sponsored by different companies she worked for and remained in the \nU.S legally on work visas. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2006. \nHer husband became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2007 and resides in the U.S with \nApplicant and their son.1 \n \n \nAppellant retained her Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. She \ndid not believe keeping the passport had any impact on her citizenship. She understood \nTaiwanese law did not recognize dual citizenship and therefore her passport was \nbasically null and void, although it had not expired. She did not think she had dual \n \n1 Tr. 29, 38-42, 51-53, 69. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ncitizenship status with the U.S. and Taiwan because this status is not recognized by \nTaiwan. She did not use her Taiwanese passport once she became a U.S. citizen.2  \n \n \nApplicant was unaware of the security implications of holding a foreign passport. \nShe was made aware of the security concerns raised by her retaining her Taiwanese \npassport, even if it was not considered valid by Taiwan. Subsequent to the hearing \nApplicant surrendered her Taiwanese passport to her employer\u2019s facilities security \nofficer.3 She stated she renounced any citizenship ties with Taiwan when she became a \nU.S. citizen. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in 1996. Her mother, a retired teacher, is a citizen \nof Taiwan. Applicant sponsored her to be a permanent resident of the U.S. and her \nrequest has been approved. She is expected to travel to the U.S. on November 2, 2008, \nand will live with Applicant and her family. Once she has lived in the U.S. for five years \nshe will then be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship status. She currently is living in \nTaiwan with Applicant\u2019s brother. Applicant talks to her mother once a week. They \ndiscuss family issues. Applicant does not provide financial support to her mother.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He works as a program \nmanager for a major camera manufacturer, a private enterprise. Applicant is also \nsponsoring her brother for permanent resident status in the U.S. However, the wait for \nsiblings requesting permanent resident status is much longer, approximately ten years, \nand his case is pending. When Applicant telephones her mother, if her brother is \npresent, she will talk with him, but she does not call him directly. Applicant does not \nprovide financial support to her brother.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He is a retired small \nbusiness owner. He has never worked for the government and intends on remaining in \nTaiwan. Applicant testified that she seldom has any contact with him. Her husband \ncontacts his father by telephone approximately once every three to six months.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law became a U.S. citizen in December 2007. At the time \nApplicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) her mother-in-law was a \npermanent resident of the U.S. She has lived in the U.S with her daughter, Applicant\u2019s \nsister-in-law, for six years. Applicant has regular contact with her mother-in-law. She is \n \n2 Tr. 23-29, 43, 60, 77-78. Answer to SOR, Applicant provided documents to verify her family\u2019s \nimmigration and naturalization status. \n \n3 AE A. Applicant provided a notarized document from the Facilities Security Officer \nacknowledging acceptance of Applicant\u2019s passport and storage until she leaves employment and \nnotification of the proper authorities in the event they return the passport. \n \n4 Tr. 29-31-33, 49, 53, 70-73. \n \n5 Tr. 31-33, 50-51, 73. \n \n6 Tr. 33-35. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \naware of one trip to Taiwan her mother-in-law has made. Applicant\u2019s husband has only \none sibling, his sister, who is a citizen of the U.S. Her husband is also a citizen of the \nU.S.7 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in 2002 to introduce her son to her parents. She \nwas not yet a U.S. citizen so was required to use her Taiwanese passport. Due to her \nmother\u2019s declining health, she traveled again in 2006 and 2007. She carried her \nTaiwanese passport with her after she became a U.S. citizen, but did not present it to \nimmigration officials. She was concerned on her trips to Taiwan after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen that officials would require some type of Taiwanese documentation or her \nTaiwanese passport because she was obviously of Taiwanese decent. She was \nunfamiliar with the procedures and was concerned that she would be required to have \ndocumentation, so she retained her passport and took it with her on the trips. She did \nnot use it and has not used it since becoming a U.S. citizen.8 \n \n \n \nApplicant visited her mother, grandmother, and brother, while in Taiwan. She has \nthree uncles that live in close proximity to her mother and she visited them also. None of \nher relatives are employed by the Taiwanese government. She has had no other \ncontact with her uncles, except to see them when she was in the country.9 \n \n \nApplicant does not have any property or financial interests in Taiwan. She owns \na residence in the U.S. that she and her husband purchased in 1999 for approximately \n$293,000. They have retirement investments worth about $120,000.10 \n \nTaiwan11 \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC \ndoes not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and \nsound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, \nagricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology \ngoods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole \nlegal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the \n \n7 Tr. 35-36, 57-59. \n \n8 Tr. 44, 54-56. \n \n9 Tr. 46-49. \n \n10 Tr. 54, 61-69, 74-75. \n \n11 All of the information about Taiwan is contained in the Hearing Exhibits that were provided.   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan, a private \nnonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue visas, accept \npassport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart \norganization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the \nUnited States would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a \nsubstantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine \naircraft, and diesel submarines. The current White House also was more \naccommodating to visits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. Administrations, and \npermitted visits from Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president \nand defense minister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to \nhave dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits. \nTaiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \u201cWhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport\u201d) and (b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship by an American citizen.) Applicant retained her foreign passport after she \nbecame a U.S. citizen and was unaware of the security implications. I find (a) applies. \nTaiwan does not recognize dual citizenship. Applicant has never sought recognition as \na dual citizen or exercised any right that could be interpreted to be acting as a dual \ncitizenship. No other disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11(e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, \nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d) Applicant \nprovided appropriate documentation to show she surrendered her Taiwanese passport \nto her employer\u2019s facilities security officer. I find (e) applies. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \u201cForeign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have especially considered (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d); (b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual \u2018s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesires to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d) and \n(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if \nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d). Applicant\u2019s husband and mother-in-law are U.S. citizens \nresiding in the U.S. and therefore the factual allegations regarding their citizen status \nraised in the SOR are no longer a security concern and no disqualifying conditions \napply to them. However, her mother, brother, and father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan, thereby creating a potential heightened risk and a potential conflict \nof interests. I find (a) and (b) apply. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s father is a citizen and \nresident of Taiwan. In addition, Applicant\u2019s mother is moving to the U.S. to reside with \n\n \n8 \n \n \nher. Therefore, because Applicant lives with her husband and her mother will soon be \nresiding with her, I find (d) applies. \nAG \u00b6 8 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised. I \nhave considered all of them and especially considered (a) (\u201cthe nature of the \nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these person are located, or the \npositions or activities of those person in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d); (b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and  loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterests\u201d); and (c) (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d)  \nTaiwan is a democracy, does not have a poor human rights record, and is \ndependent upon the United States for arms, as well as its defense against the Peoples \nRepublic of China. Taiwan is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, but there is no indication that Taiwan utilizes coercion against its citizens \nor former citizens for espionage purposes. Many of our allies conduct intelligence \ngathering against the U.S. Taiwan would be risking a great deal by raising the stakes, \nand attempting to use duress against one of its citizens in an attempt to coerce a U.S. \ncitizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s mother, brother, and father-in-law are not good \ncandidates for coercion as they are not dependent upon the government of Taiwan. \nApplicant has virtually no contact with her father-in-law and her husband has \nminimal contact, a phone call once every three to six months. She will see him when \nshe visits Taiwan, but that is likely to be very infrequent, if at all, once her mother moves \nto the U.S. I also find that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation to him is minimal. \nHe is a retired small businessman and it makes it unlikely that she would have to make \na choice between his interest and those of the U.S. I find because she has very little \ncontact with him and it is unlikely a conflict would arise, but in the event it did, she can \nbe expected to be resolved in favor of the U.S. I find (a) partially applies and (b) fully \napplies to her father-in-law. I find her relationship with her father-in-law is casual and \ninfrequent, however because her husband has some contact with him I find (c) only \npartially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her mother and brother are much closer. Even \nthough she does not speak with her brother often, she is sponsoring him for entry into \nthe U.S. as she did with her mother. Her mother is soon to be a permanent resident in \nthe U.S. and will live with Applicant. She is a retired teacher, with no ties to the \ngovernment. I find the nature of the relationship between Taiwan and the U.S. to be \nsuch that it is unlikely Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween her family and the interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s retired status with \n\n \n9 \n \n \nno ties to the Taiwanese government, her imminent emigration and the fact that \nApplicant is rooted with her family in the U.S. reinforce this position. Applicant\u2019s brother \nhas applied for permanent resident status, but the process is longer for siblings. He \nworks for a private company. Her brother will remain in Taiwan until his immigrant status \nis granted.  \nI find the relationships Applicant has with her relatives in Taiwan and the status of \nTaiwan as an American ally as described above make it unlikely that Applicant would be \nput in a position of having to choose between the interests of her family members or the \ninterests of the U.S. In the unlikely event that was to occur, I find she can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. It is clear, Applicant has settled in \nthe U.S. with her family, has an established career, and her personal wealth are all tied \nto the U.S. Therefore, I find (b) applies and (a) partially applies to Applicant\u2019s mother \nand brother. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s mother, brother and \nfather-in-law are citizens of Taiwan. Her mother will soon be a permanent U.S. resident, \nbut the others remain in Taiwan. She has some contact with her brother and her \nhusband has some contact with his father.  \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1994. She and her husband \nare both naturalized U.S. citizens. Her son was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. \nHer husband\u2019s sister and mother are both U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. Applicant \nhas all of her property interests in the U.S. and none in Taiwan. She and her husband \nhave careers in the U.S. She and her family are firmly rooted in the U.S. She has \nsponsored her mother and brother for permanent U.S. resident status. Her mother will \nmove to the U.S. in the next month. Her brother\u2018s paperwork is complete, but he must \nwait longer. None of her relatives or her husband\u2019s has ties to the Taiwanese \n\n \n10 \n \n \ngovernment. She never considered herself to be a dual citizen even though she \nretained her Taiwanese passport after she became a U.S. citizen. She never used it \nand when she became aware that retaining it raised a security concern, she \nsurrendered it her employer\u2019s facility security officer. Although Taiwan is an active \ncollector of industrial espionage, as are many countries, there is no evidence that they \ntarget their citizens or former citizens with coercive methods in their quest for sensitive \nor classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign \npreference and, foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline B: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s spouse has a 29-year-old daughter from a previous \nrelationship (Tr. 39).  \n \n \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he started using \nmarijuana at age 21 and used it about four times and month until January 2005. He also \ndisclosed that he started using cocaine at age 28 and had used it daily for the three \nyears preceding his application. He disclosed his in-patient treatment for alcohol \ndependence, cocaine dependence, and major depression on two occasions, in \nNovember and December 2002 and in February and March 2005. He disclosed he had \nbeen spending his entire pay check and selling or pawning personal possessions to \nsupport his dependency, his wages had been garnished for delinquent utility bills in \nJanuary 2000 and his debts for medical treatment in January and February 2005 were \nmore than 180 days delinquent (GX 1). At the hearing, he testified he spent his entire \npaycheck on drugs when he was younger, but more recently he was spending only $40 \nor $50 for drugs (Tr. 48). \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on August 4, 2008, Applicant disclosed he \nhad been treated for drug abuse from June 14 to June 20, 2008, and that he had \nstopped using illegal substances about a year before because he saw his life \u201cgoing \ndown hill\u201d and he was hurting his family. He stated he was not participating in Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a similar organization, but he had \u201cfound faith in the Lord\u201d and had a \ndifferent outlook on life (GX 2 at 4, 7-8). In response to supplemental interrogatories on \nApril 10, 2009, he stated he was regularly attending church to assist him from drinking \nalcoholic beverages, and he had last consumed alcohol in June 2008, when he \nconsumed a 40-ounce container of beer (GX 4 at 2-3; Tr. 54).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f that he failed an employment drug \nscreening in June 1998. He admitted, however, that he was admitted to a hospital in \n1998 for drug treatment and was diagnosed as suffering from alcohol dependence and \ncocaine abuse (Tr. 51-52). He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c that he used PCP \n[phencyclidine] \u201cand/or\u201d LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] once in February 2000 (Tr. 50). \nHe admitted being referred to a drug treatment facility in August 2000 and being \ndischarged a month later for failure to comply with the program (Tr. 52). He admitted \nbeing treated in April 2003 and July 2004, going to the emergency room for substance \nabuse in February 2005, and being admitted to a hospital for major depression in April \n2006 (Tr. 53). He admitted using crack cocaine once on June 13, 2008, and then \nadmitting himself into a one-week drug treatment program on June 14, 2008 (Tr. 58). \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in November 1999, listing \nliabilities totaling about $60,000. He received a discharge in February 2000 (Tr. 60-61). \nThe bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. His credit reported dated March 8, 2007, \nreflected his bankruptcy as well as 20 delinquent debts incurred after the bankruptcy \n(GX 3). \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had settled the auto repossession debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b, a delinquent telephone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c, and a delinquent \ncredit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.q (AX A; AX B, AX D; Tr. 65-68). He was making \nmonthly payments on the medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.s (AX H; AX I; Tr. 70-71). The \nmedical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.s appears to duplicate the medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n3.d, since the amounts are similar and they both have the same account number (GX 3 \nat 12, 13). The medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e-3.p and 3.t, totaling about $10,466, \nas well as the $500 credit card account alleged in \u00b6 3.r, are unresolved. The $11,534 \nauto repossession debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.u is unresolved. Applicant and his wife also \nhad settled two delinquent telephone bills (AX E; AX G) and a delinquent medical bill \n(AX F) that were reflected on their credit report but not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement dated August 4, 2008, in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories. It reflected net monthly income of $2,454, expenses \nof $1,826, no debt payments, and a remainder of $628 (GX 2 at 18). At the hearing, he \ntestified his net monthly pay is about $2,000 per month, and his wife also is employed, \nbut he does not know how much she earns (Tr. 75). His wife takes care of the family \nfinances, and he concentrates on his job (Tr. 37).They purchased their home in August \n2008, after he submitted his personal financial statement, trading land that Applicant \ninherited for the home. They did not borrow any money to acquire the home (Tr. 73). \nPurchasing the home reduced their monthly expenses by eliminating the monthly rent of \n$225. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used cocaine, \u201cwith varying frequency to include, at \ntimes, daily\u201d from 1992 to January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 1985 to January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he used PCP \u201cand/or\u201d LSD once in \nFebruary 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); he purchased illegal drugs on numerous occasions (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d); and he used illegal drugs after being granted a security clearance in 1990 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). It also alleges he was referred to a hospital after failing an employment drug \nscreening in June 1998 and was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and cocaine \nabuse (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Finally, it alleges he was referred to a hospital on August 9, 2000, \nand treated for cocaine dependence following a relapse and suicidal ideation, but he \nwas discharged on September 9, 2000 for failing to attend prescribed treatment \nsessions (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse@; Aillegal \ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia@; and \u201cany illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g). Applicant admitted purchasing \nand using cocaine and marijuana after being granted a clearance, as alleged in the \nSOR. He denied failing an \u201cemployment drug screening\u201d as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but he \nadmitted the remaining allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.f that he was referred to a hospital and \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence and cocaine abuse. Finally, he admitted being \ntreated for cocaine dependence after a relapse and being discharged from treatment for \nfailing to attend treatment sessions, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand the evidence produced by the government raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g). \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline also include \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \ndrug abuse or drug dependence\u201d; \u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram\u201d; and \u201cfailure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional\u201d. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(d), (e), and (f). These disqualifying \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconditions are not raised because there is no evidence of the qualifications of the \npersons who diagnosed Applicant or prescribed treatment. \n \nApplicant denied using PCP or LSD as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and the \ngovernment produced no evidence to support this allegation. I conclude Applicant has \nrefuted SOR \u00b6 1.c, and I resolve it in his favor. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first clause of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent.  There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of cocaine was on June 13, 2008, less than a year ago, and \nit followed drug treatment and relapse in June 1998, September 2000, April 2003, July \n2004, and February 2005. Given his history of treatment and relapse, insufficient time \nhas passed since his last relapse to establish his rehabilitation. His drug abuse has \nbeen frequent, did not occur under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and raises \ndoubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n26(a) is not established.  \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant has declared his intent \nnot to use drugs again, but he has not demonstrated his intent by any of the indicators \nset out in this guideline. As noted above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 26(a), his period of \nabstinence from drugs is insufficient to establish that he is not likely to relapse again. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by \u201csatisfactory \ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(d). Applicant receives \nsome mitigating credit for admitting himself into a drug treatment program several times, \nmost recently in June 2008, but this mitigating condition is not fully established because \nthere is no evidence of a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f (diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence in June 1998) under this guideline. The concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be raised by \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n22(a). Security concerns also may arise from \u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as \nreporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(b). Neither of these disqualifying conditions is raised, because \nthere is no evidence of an \u201calcohol-related incidents,\u201d either at work or away from work. \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c). While Applicant \nadmitted on his security clearance application that he is alcohol dependent, this \ndisqualifying condition is not raised because there is no evidence of the extent of \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised either by \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d or by \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d) and (e). These disqualifying conditions are not \nestablished because there is no evidence of the professional qualifications of the person \nwho diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent. \n \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 22(f). Applicant admitted in two sets of responses to interrogatories that he had \nreceived treatment due to his use of alcohol (GX 2 at 7; GX 4 at 3). He disclosed on his \nsecurity clearance application that he was treated in 2002 and 2005 for alcohol \ndependence. He admitted he consumed a 40-ounce container of beer in June 2008. \nThis evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 22(f). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant was \ndiagnosed and treated for alcohol dependence in 1998, 2002, and 2005. He relapsed in \nJune 2008. His alcohol consumption was recent, frequent, and did not occur under \ncircumstances unlikely to recur, and casts doubt on his current reliability and \ntrustworthiness. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant \nacknowledged his past alcohol dependence. He relies on his church and his family to \navoid problems with alcohol. Nevertheless, he was treated three times for alcohol \ndependence, and he relapsed in June 2008. I conclude this mitigating condition is not \nestablished. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant \nhas not demonstrated a \u201cclear and established pattern\u201d of abstinence, and there is no \nevidence of a favorable prognosis by a qualified medical professional or licensed clinical \nsocial worker. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in February 2000 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a) and 20 delinquent debts that were incurred after the bankruptcy discharge (SOR \u00b6 \n3.b-3.u). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \n\n \n9 \n \n \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c). In \naddition, his irresponsible spending to buy illegal drugs instead of paying his debts \nraises AG \u00b6 19(b). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that the medical bill in SOR \u00b6 3.s duplicates the \nmedical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR \nunder the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in \nApplicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same \ndebt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 3.d in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, are not yet resolved, did not occur under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur, and cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused largely by his drug \ninvolvement.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Neither \nprong of this mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy was a lawful means \nof resolving the $60,000 in debts that were discharged, but it does not necessarily \nestablish good faith, especially because Applicant\u2019s financial problems leading up to the \nbankruptcy were drug-related. Applicant has resolved the delinquent debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, and 3.q, and he is making payments on the medical bill alleged in \u00b6 \n3.s. He has done nothing to resolve the other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, 3.q, and 3.s, but \nnot for bankruptcy and the other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H, G, and F in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. Notwithstanding his drug problems, he has managed \nto serve satisfactorily for more almost 24 years, and he has held a clearance, \napparently without incident, for almost 19 years. He was candid about his substance \nabuse on his security clearance application, in his responses to DOHA interrogatories, \nand at the hearing. To his credit, he has sought and received treatment for his drug \ndependence, and he has turned to his church and his family for support, but more time \nis needed to determine if he has successfully turned his life around.

He supplied\nanswers to interrogatories concerning his financial indebtedness on July 17, 2008. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\non January 23, 2009 detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n In his SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to all financial questions in modules 27 and 28. Though these\n1\nresponses cannot be considered in the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the incorrect information has a negative\neffect on Applicant\u2019s overall credibility.\n2\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nApplicant provided his answer to the SOR on March 3, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 6, 2009 for a hearing on April 23, 2009. The hearing was\ncancelled on April 18, 2009. The case was reassigned to me for administrative reasons.\nA notice of hearing was issued on June 3, 2009 for a hearing on June 23, 2009. At the\nhearing, six exhibits (GE I through 6) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government's case. Applicant provided testimony until I determined the case\nshould be continued because he was inadequately prepared to represent himself. On\nJuly 8, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued for a continuation of the June 23 hearing to\nJuly 28, 2009. Applicant and his wife testified. Applicant offered two exhibits (AE A and\nAE B) that were admitted in evidence without objection. In the time period allowed to\nsubmit post-hearing exhibits, Applicant submitted AE C through AE J. The post-hearing\nexhibits contain a character statement of Applicant, three citations or awards,\ndocumentary proof of payment of $1,000 to settle the debt identified in SOR 1.c., and a\nbrochure from a financial counseling service in the state. DOHA received the transcript\non August 11, 2009. References to the hearing transcript on June 23, 2009, shall be\ncited as Tr. I, followed by the page number. References to the hearing transcript on July\n28, 2009 shall be cited as Tr. II, followed by the page number. \nRulings on Procedure\nThe hearing on June 23, 2009 was suspended after it became apparent\nApplicant was having difficulty presenting his case. I concluded he was not adequately\nprepared (Tr. I 21, 28-40). Applicant testified his wife always handled the finances and\nwrote the checks to pay bills (Tr. I 36-37). Before postponing the hearing, I explained\nthat when he returned to complete the hearing, he should be much more aware of the\nstatus of each debt, and, because of her primary role in handling the finances, that he\nshould bring his wife to supplement his testimony (Tr. I 50-55).\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists six delinquent debts. The accounts represent credit cards, and an\nauto loan account. The state tax lien was filed in April 1998. In his answer to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the debts identified in SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f. He denied\nthe auto loan account listed in SOR 1.d. because he completed payment on the loan on\nFebruary 18, 2009 (AE B at 4).\nApplicant is 69 years old. He married his second wife in February 2000. He has\ntwo grown children, and two grown stepchildren (GE 1, SCA).  He has been employed\n1\nas a security guard since April 2001 (GE 1). His wife has been employed 32 years with\n\n3\nthe state division of employment services (Tr. II 7). He seeks a Secret security\nclearance. \nThe six delinquent debts in the SOR total $21,738. Five of the six debts became\ndelinquent in 2005. The sixth delinquent account is a state tax lien (SOR 1.f.) totaling\n$10,584. The lien was filed against Applicant in April 1998 for not paying taxes that\nwere still due when he closed his business. Applicant operated a business of\ncreating/developing animated characters for television (Tr. I 31). In developing these\ncharacters, he used his own equipment, including studios, stages and cameras (Tr. I\n31). He recalled selling all the items and paying off all his debts before he closed the\nbusiness in 1994 (Tr. II 32). The first time he found out about the tax lien was in\nFebruary 2008 when he was interviewed by a government investigator (Tr. I 32). He did\nnot contact the state to obtain information about the lien because he believed the lien\ninformation was incorrect (Tr. I 33; Tr. II 37). Applicant recalled when he closed his\nbusiness in 1994, he did not file a final tax return (Tr. II 37). Applicant\u2019s wife testified that\nhe scheduled an appointment with a tax agent for August 7, 2009 (Tr. II 14) to resolve\nthe lien. Applicant indicated in a post-hearing submission he met with the tax\nrepresentative on August 7, 2009, and agreed to pay him $500 to resolve the tax lien\n(AE C).\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that no plan for repayment had been established for the\ndelinquent debt in SOR 1.b. (Tr. II 11-12). On July 27, 2008, she contacted the\ncollection agency identified in SOR 1.c., and arranged a settlement of the credit card\ndebt for $1,000 (Tr. II 12). The settlement transaction occurred on July 31, 2009 (AE G).\nRegarding SOR 1.e., Applicant\u2019s wife is still trying to negotiate a settlement plan their\nearnings can reasonably accommodate (Tr. II 14).\nOne of the two remaining delinquent accounts listed in the SOR is a judgment\n(SOR 1.a.) that was entered against Applicant in November 2007 for $1,616. The last\nSOR debt that has not been addressed is Applicant\u2019s auto loan (SOR 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s\nwife added these two accounts to the PFS she prepared for Applicant in July 2008. (GE\n2;Tr. II. 17). The PFS is being addressed because it shows additional, unlisted\ndelinquent credit accounts that Applicant is servicing that are not listed in the SOR. The\nPFS shows that in July 2008 Applicant and his wife earned $4,159 month, minus\nmonthly expenses of $1,422, and monthly debt payments of $2,447, leaving a net\nmonthly remainder of $289 a month (Id.). In the monthly debt payment module of the\nPFS, Applicant\u2019s wife identified ten credit or installment accounts and payments they\nare making on each account (Id.). After the first account (Applicant\u2019s mortgage), the\nnext six accounts ($20,574) in the debt module (excluding the fifth account which is\nSOR 1.a.) are delinquent (GE 2). The first account (Applicant\u2019s mortgage) listed in the\ndebt module is current (Tr. II 19-21). \nThe second account (not listed in the SOR) in Applicant\u2019s PFS debt module was\noriginally his late mother-in-law\u2019s credit card she used to pay her expenses before she\ndied in 2004 (GE 2 at 4, 5; Tr. II 21-23). After her death, Applicant and his wife agreed\nto assume liability for the account, and have been paying $313 a month since August\n\n Attached to GE 2 are 16 documents followed by a credit bureau report dated July 17, 2008. Each of the 16\n2\ndocuments are numbered chronologically (in handwriting) in the upper right hand corner. \n4\n2005 (Tr. II 21) under the creditor\u2019s special repayment program that was applied to the\naccount prohibiting Applicant and his wife from using the card (for credit purchases)\nuntil further notice (GE 2 at 5).  \n2\nThe third account (not listed in the SOR) in Applicant\u2019s PFS debt module is a\ncredit card used by Applicant and his wife (GE 2 at 7; Tr. II 21). This card is covered by\nthe same repayment program (applied in July 2005) that requires a $298 monthly\npayment, and prevents Applicant and his wife from using the credit card (GE 2 at 7).\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that the balances of the second and the third credit card\naccounts have each been reduced to about $3,000 (Tr. II 23). Applicant testified the\nsecond and third credit card accounts originally carried balances of $14,500 and\n$15,000 because they were using the cards to pay off other credit cards (Tr. I 46). \nThe fourth account (not listed in the SOR) in Applicant\u2019s PFS debt module is a\ncredit card (GE 2). Applicant was trying to settle the delinquent account with three\npayments of $457 (Id. at 8). GE 5 shows the account was settled in 2008 (GE 5).\nThe fifth account (SOR 1.a.) in Applicant\u2019s PFS debt module is a credit card\naccount that was opened in December 2003 and became delinquent after August 2005\n(GE 6). A judgment was entered on the account in November 2007 (GE 5). Applicant\u2019s\nwife had been paying $100 a month on the judgment from an unknown time in 2007\nuntil July 2008, when she stopped paying on the judgment because the mortgage (first\naccount in debt module) started falling behind (Tr. II 27). Also, she had medical\nproblems (Tr. II 10-11). She provided no additional information about her medical\nproblems. In July 2009, she resumed payments to the SOR 1.a. creditor. She made two\npayments of $200 each on July 16, and July 22, 2009 (Tr. II 10-11; AE F). \nThe sixth account in Applicant\u2019s PFS is not listed in the SOR, but is another\ncredit card account transferred for collection to the same law firm listed in SOR 1.a. (GE\n2 at 10).\nThe seventh account in Applicant\u2019s PFS debt module is also not listed in the SOR\n(GE 2). The credit union account was transferred to a collection agency who advised\nApplicant they had received his $200 payment on June 23, 2008 (GE 2 at 11). Applicant\nwrote in the column of the exhibit that the account was debited $200 every month until\nthe debt was paid in full; however, there is no date on the document indicating when the\ndebt was paid-in-full (Id.). There is no independent documentation from the collection\nagency verifying the debt was paid. \nThe eighth, ninth and tenth debts appear on the second page of Applicant\u2019s PFS\ndebt module. These three accounts are current or paid off. The eighth account listed in\nthe PFS, an installment loan (SOR 1.d.), has been satisfied with a final payment made\nin February 2009 (AE B at 4). The ninth account is an installment loan taken out in\n\n Applicant\u2019s annual income is computed by multiplying his monthly income of $4,159 (GE 2, PFS) by 12\n3\nmonths. \n5\nMarch 2004 for $5,118. The loan is current (GE 2 at 13). The tenth account listed in\nApplicant\u2019s PFS is a credit union account belonging to Applicant\u2019s wife. It is current (GE\n2 at 14). \nIncluded in GE 2 are two collection statements (GE 2 at 15, 16). Although neither\naccount is listed in the SOR, both collection statements confirm two separate,\ndelinquent credit accounts that remain Applicant\u2019s responsibility. (See also GE 5 and\nGE 6). \nThe record does not provide much detail as to why Applicant and his wife have\ncarried so much delinquent debt in their PFS. Both said that they occasionally used their\ncredit cards (credit accounts listed in the SOR and credit accounts not listed in SOR, but\nincluded in Applicant\u2019s PFS) to pay off their other creditors (Tr. II 22-24, 39-40). When\nasked whether medical issues caused their financial difficulties, Applicant described a\ndislocated shoulder (Tr. II 35) and his eye problems in June 2008 requiring surgery, but\nthen indicated that his insurance covered 80% of the cost of the eye surgery (Tr. II 40-\n44). \nThe total amount of debt in the SOR is $21,738. The total amount of unlisted\nindebtedness in the debt module of Applicant\u2019s PFS is $20,534. The total amount\ndelinquent debt is more than $41,000. Even after subtracting the delinquent debts that\nApplicant settled over the last year, the delinquent debt is still at least $25,000.\nApplicant\u2019s yearly income is approximately $49,908  (GE 2). \n3\nAlthough Applicant did not specifically indicate at the June 23 or July 28 hearings\nwhether he had financial counseling, I find that he has never had financial counseling. I\nmake this finding because: (1) Applicant was not prepared to represent himself at the\nhearing on June 23, 2009 (Tr. I 21, 28-40), (2) his wife makes all the financial decisions\n(Tr. I 36-37), and (3) he testified regarding the importance of receiving financial\ncounseling (Tr. II 45, 46).\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s site supervisor, who has known Applicant professionally since\nJanuary 2008, wrote a character endorsement praising Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and\ndedication to his job assignments (AE E). AE H is a brochure published by a consumer\ncredit counseling organization that Applicant plans to contact (Tr. 46; AE H). On August\n7, 2009, Applicant consulted with a tax agent concerning the state tax lien identified in\nSOR 1.f. (AE C).\nApplicant received an honorable discharge from the United States Army in\nOctober 1966 (AE I). AE J contains an undated certificate awarded Applicant for\nexceptional performance in coverage of aircraft posts. In November 2004 and the first\n\n6\nquarter of 2007, Applicant was favorably recognized for an outstanding job performance\n(Id.)  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nParagraph 18 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) sets forth the security concern\nrelated to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nThe financial guideline lists three disqualifying conditions that may be applicable\nto this case:\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of failing to meet financial obligations); and\nAG \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis).\nThe SOR lists six delinquent debts that total $21,738. Applicant is unable to pay\nthese debts. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies. Most of the listed debts became delinquent in 2005.\nThe state tax lien identified in SOR 1.f. was filed 11 years ago in April 1998. AG \u00b6 19(c)\napplies because Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  \nWhen Applicant and his wife were asked why they had so much delinquent debt,\ntheir main response was that occasionally they used the credit cards to pay off other\nbills or credit cards. After adding the delinquent debt listed in the SOR to the unlisted\ndelinquent accounts listed on the first page of Applicant\u2019s PFS, the total is more than\n$41,000. Even though Applicant\u2019s payments on some accounts and settlements on\nother accounts over the last year have reduced the total delinquent amount to about\n$25,000, AG \u00b6 19(e) still applies because of the excessive indebtedness and high debt\n($25,000)-to-income ($49,908) ratio. \n\n8\nThe financial guideline identifies four mitigating conditions that may apply to the\ncase:\nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); and \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the person acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); and\nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); and\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant has failed to establish that the\ncircumstances are unlikely to recur. First, Applicant still owes four of six listed accounts.\nSecond, in addition to the listed delinquent debts, Applicant is servicing at least three\ndelinquent accounts that are identified in his PFS. Neither Applicant nor his wife could\nadequately explain why they had so much delinquent debt. The age of the listed and\nunlisted delinquent debt, the amount of the debt, and Applicant\u2019s inability to explain why\nthere was a large amount of delinquent debt, all raise security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s reliability, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application as Applicant has presented minimal\nevidence that his financial problems were caused by events beyond his control.\nApplicant mentioned a dislocated shoulder and eye surgery. His wife mentioned medical\nproblems. However, without documentation outlining the costs, assigning more weight\nto the mitigator would be grounded upon speculation rather than the record. \nApplicant has received no financial counseling, and there is no indication the\nindebtedness is under control. Applicant still owes four of six delinquent accounts listed\nin the SOR. In addition, he owes at least three additional delinquent debts identified in\nhis PFS. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6\n20(d), but not nearly enough to meet his burden of demonstrating he warrants a security\nclearance. \n\n9\nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was 67 years old in 2007 when he filled out his SCA. In February 2008,\nApplicant was told by the government that a state tax lien had been filed against him.\nOn July 17, 2008, Applicant was asked to provide information about the state lien and\nother debts listed in the SOR. In his PFS (attached to his interrogatory answers),\nApplicant provided information in the debt module that showed his unlisted delinquent\ndebt almost equaled the delinquent debt listed in the SOR. On January 30, 2009, an\nSOR was mailed to Applicant. Along with the five other delinquent accounts, the SOR\nincluded the state tax lien filed in April 1998. In his March 2009 response to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the state tax lien. On July 28, 2009, Applicant was asked why he did\nnot take action on the tax lien. His reply was that he thought the lien information was a\nmistake. \nThe settlement of SOR 1.c. and 1.d. constitutes favorable evidence weighing in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. On the other hand, Applicant has made no progress concerning SOR\n1.b., 1.e., 1.f., and only recently has resumed payments on SOR 1.a. Even though he\nhas been on notice since February 2008 that there are debts he should address, except\nfor the debt identified in SOR 1.d., he took no action to repay any of the delinquent SOR\naccounts until March 2009. Applicant\u2019s three awards and the favorable reference from\nhis site supervisor have been considered. The fact he has settled some unlisted\ndelinquent accounts also weighs in his favor. Having weighed and balanced the entire\nrecord as a whole, given Applicant\u2019s excessive indebtedness, the high income-to-debt\nratio, and the absence of financial counseling, I am unable to conclude his indebtedness\nis being effectively managed and/or is under control. Applicant has not met his burden\nunder the financial considerations guideline. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), based on 50 delinquent debts reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 12, 2007. On \nDecember 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 2, 2009; answered it on the same day; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nMarch 3, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 17, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 19, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nMarch 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but submitted no documentary evidence. I kept the record \nopen until May 6, 2009, to enable him to submit evidence. DOHA received the transcript \non April 28, 2009. Applicant timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX A is attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit I. The record closed on May 6, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he was unaware of his right to be represented by \na lawyer or personal representative (Tr. 4-5). The previously-assigned Department \nCounsel sent the \u201cdiscovery packet\u201d containing GX 1 through 4 to Applicant on March \n16, 2009. The cover letter explained to Applicant that he was entitled to retain an \nattorney or obtain the help of a personal representative, but it was sent to his former \naddress (HX II). Applicant stated he never received the packet (Tr. 22).  \n \nThe currently-assigned Department Counsel determined on March 26, 2009, that \nApplicant had moved to another address (HX III). A discovery packet was never sent to \nApplicant\u2019s new address and apparently was not forwarded from his previous address \n(Tr. 23).  \n \nThe notice of hearing sent to Applicant and his employer included a \nmemorandum entitled, \u201cPrehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance \n(ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings.\u201d This memorandum also advised \nthe recipient of the right to be represented by an attorney or personal representative \n(HX IV). Applicant received the hearing notice, but he stated he did not remember \nseeing the memorandum attached to the notice (Tr. 20). I conclude that he received the \nmemorandum attached to the hearing notice but paid no attention to it.  \n \n \nI asked Applicant if he would have hired a lawyer if he knew he was entitled to \none, and he responded in the negative, stating he could not afford a lawyer. I asked him \nif he was willing to continue the hearing while representing himself, and he responded in \nthe affirmative (Tr. 24). Based on Applicant\u2019s statement that he would not have hired a \nlawyer even if he had been aware of his right to do so, and his affirmative statement that \nhe desired to continue the hearing and represent himself, I conducted the hearing as \nscheduled. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, 1.x, 1.cc, 1.dd, 1.ee, 1.gg, 1.rr, and 1.ss. He did \n\n \n3 \n \n \nnot address the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.n and 1.bb in his answer. At the \nhearing, he admitted the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.p, and 1.t. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old shipping and receiving clerk employed by a defense \ncontractor. He began working as a temporary employee in October 2007, and he \nbecame a permanent employee on November 1, 2007. He has an interim clearance, but \nhe has never held a final clearance (Tr. 5, 32-33).  \n \n \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children (Tr. 31). He has a high school \neducation and has taken some college courses (Tr. 5).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the delinquent rent alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a occurred when he \nstopped paying rent because his landlord refused to make repairs to the apartment (Tr. \n35-36). His landlord obtained a judgment against him, which is unsatisfied. \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d were delinquent rent payments. They were \nsatisfied by garnishment (Tr. 36-37; AX A). \n \n \nThe bad checks alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.k-1.o, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.gg, and the \noverdraft charges alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p and 1.t arose when Applicant\u2019s checking \naccount was overdrawn. He testified he believed the bad check alleged in \u00b6 1.gg was \npaid, but he could not produce any documentation of payment. He knew the checks had \nbeen dishonored, but he did nothing because no one contacted him about them. \n \n \nApplicant testified his delinquent medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.i, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.y-\n1.aa, 1.ii, 1.mm-1.pp, 1.tt-1.vv, and 1.xx) arose when he had a pacemaker implanted in \nDecember 2003 (Tr. 64). His medical insurance carrier changed from the time he had \nthe implant until he was released from the hospital, and each carrier insisted that the \nother carrier was responsible for the medical bills (Tr. 29-30). He testified his father has \nmade inquiries with the insurance companies, but Applicant has not filed disputes with \nthe credit bureaus or had any contact with the insurance companies or medical \nproviders (Tr. 59). \n \n \nApplicant denied the delinquent cable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w, testifying it was \nhis father\u2019s account. He and his father have the same name. He called the cable \ncompany, and was informed there was no account with his social security number, but \nhe has not filed a dispute with the credit bureau (Tr. 48-49). He produced no written \ndocumentation regarding this account. \n \n \nApplicant testified he believed the delinquent debt for satellite television service \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x was paid, but he was unable to produce any documentation (Tr. \n49-50). He testified his video store account referred to in SOR \u00b6 1.hh was current, but \nhe was unable to produce documentation (Tr. 54-55). He denied the debt for an \nunreturned video alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ww, but he produced no evidence concerning the \nstatus of his account with the video store (Tr. 56). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant neither admitted nor denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.bb. He \ntestified he believed it was for furniture, but he was unable to produce any evidence it \nwas resolved (Tr. 51).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the three delinquent cell phone debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.cc-1.ee were unpaid. He testified he believed the cell phone debt alleged in \u00b6 1.jj \nduplicates the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.ee (Tr. 55). \n \n \nApplicant denied the collection accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ff and 1.qq, and the \ntwo restaurant debts alleged in 1.kk and 1.ll, and they remain unresolved. He admitted \nthe collection account debt in SOR \u00b6 1.rr, and it is unpaid. The tuition bill alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.ss has been paid (GX 3 at 5).  \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement (PFS) on July 30, 2008 (GX 2 at 8). His PFS reflects net monthly income of \n$1,884, expenses of $1,312, and a debt payment of $185, and monthly remainder of \n$4,126. The remainder is miscalculated; it should be $387. \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount Answer\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nRent \n$2,795 \nNone \nUnpaid \nTr. 35-36 \n1.b \nRent \n$623 \nAdmit \nPaid by garnishment \nTr. 36; AX A \n1.c \nRent \n$1009 \nAdmit \nPaid by garnishment \nTr. 37; AX A \n1.d \nRent \n$2,012 \nAdmit \nPaid by garnishment \nTr. 37; AX A \n1.e \nBad check \n$466 \nNone \nUnpaid \nTr. 40 \n1.f \nBad check \n$100 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 41-42 \n1.g \nMedical \n$35 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.h \nMedical \n$35 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.i \nMedical \n$250 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.j \nBad check \n$100 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.k \nBad check \n$76 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.l \nBad check \n$105 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.m \nBad check \n$80 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.n \nBad check \n$78 \nNone \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.o \nBad check \n$69 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.p \nOverdraft \ncharge \n$1,085 \nDeny \nAdmitted at hearing; \nunpaid \nTr. 47 \n1.q \nBad check \n$65 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.r \nBad check \n$65 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 42 \n1.s \nMedical \n$964 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n(Table continued on next page.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n1.t \nOverdraft \ncharge \n$341 \nDeny \nAdmitted at hearing; \nunpaid \nTr. 47 \n1.u \nMedical \n$179 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.v \nMedical \n$55 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.w \nCable \n$1,077 \nDeny \nDisputed; father has \nsame name; no \ndocumentation \nTr. 48 \n1.x \nSatellite TV \n$361 \nAdmit \nMaybe paid, but no \ndocumentation \nTr. 49-50 \n1.y \nMedical \n$40 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.z \nMedical \n$373 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.aa \nMedical \n$795 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.bb \nFurniture \n$1,973 \nNone \nUnpaid \nTr. 51 \n1.cc \nCell phone \n$176 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 52 \n1.dd \nCell phone \n$578 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 52 \n1.ee \nCell phone \n$727 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nTr. 53 \n1.ff \nCollection \n$334 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 54 \n1.gg \nBad check \n$31 \nAdmit \nMaybe paid; no \ndocumentation \nTr. 54 \n1.hh \nVideo store \n$18 \nDeny \nNo documentation \nTr. 54-55 \n1.ii \nMedical \n$519 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.jj \nCell phone \n$404 \nDeny \nDuplicates 1.ee \nTr. 55 \n1.kk \nRestaurant \n$159 \nDeny \nUnknown \nTr. 55-56 \n1.ll \nRestaurant \n$160 \nDeny \nUnknown \nTr. 56 \n1.mm Medical \n$190 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.nn \nMedical \n$326 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.oo \nMedical \n$373 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.pp \nMedical \n$519 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.qq \nCollection \n$646 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 56 \n1.rr \nCollection  \n$52 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nAnswer to SOR \n1.ss \nTuition \n$1,240 \nAdmit \nPaid \nGX 3 at 5 \n1.tt \nMedical \n$6,137 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.uu \nMedical \n$244 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.vv \nMedical \n$88 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.ww \nVideo store \n$90 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 56 \n1.xx \nMedical \n$100 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nTr. 57 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n6 \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 50 delinquent debts. Applicant established that four debts were \npaid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.ss). He admitted 18 debts in his answer to the SOR and two \nadditional debts at the hearing. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThe potentially disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised by an \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial history raises these two disqualifying conditions, \nshifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nThe evidence indicates that the delinquent cell phone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.jj \nduplicates the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. When the same conduct is alleged twice in \nthe SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at \n3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.jj in his \nfavor. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s debts are \nrecent and frequent. With the exception of the medical bills, they did not occur under \nunusual circumstances unlikely to recur. His inaction regarding his numerous delinquent \ndebts casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s medical problems requiring a \npacemaker implant were beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly to resolve \nthe debts that were incurred. While some of the debts should have been covered by his \nmedical insurance, many of the medical bills are for small amounts consistent with \ncopayments or deductibles. He has relied on his father to make inquiries and has taken \nvirtually no personal action to resolve the debts he believes should be covered by \ninsurance. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence Applicant has \nsought or received counseling, and his financial problems are not under control.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition is established for \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.ss, but not for the remaining debts. \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant testified the delinquent cable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w was his father\u2019s debt, \nbut he provided no documentation that his father was the account holder, and he has \ntaken no action to have the debt deleted from his credit history. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is \nnot established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He was articulate and candid at the hearing. He was \naware of his bad checks and medical bills before he applied for a clearance. His neglect \nof his financial situation raises doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.ii: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jj:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.kk-1.rr:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ss:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.tt-1.xx:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRoderic G. Steakley, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge did not consider all the\nrecord evidence; whether the Judge mis-weighed the record evidence; whether Applicant was denied\ndue process; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is an electrical and systems engineer employed by a Defense\ncontractor.  He performs document reviews to determine contractor compliance with Government\nregulations.  A graduate of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, he served seven years in the Air\nForce and another ten in the Reserves.  He has held a security clearance since 1974.\nApplicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $42,848, for tax years 1999 to 2003, which\nis the basis of the sole allegation in the SOR.  However, Applicant also had problems with his federal\ntaxes in 1992, 1995, and 1998.  His tax liability for 1992, including interest and penalties, was\n$12,000, which he paid off with an installment agreement.  He also paid off monies owed the IRS\nfrom 1995 and 1998.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file timely tax returns from 1999 and 2000 were due to his not being\nable to obtain records pertinent to his wife\u2019s business.  He also owed taxes for tax years 2001 and\n2003.  In 2008 he entered into a new agreement with the IRS to pay off his tax debt.\nWhen Applicant began working for his current employer, in February 2009, his salary was\n$122,500.  Although more than he had made at his previous employer, it was partially offset by\nincreased costs of health insurance.  Often his expenses each month are more than his income.\n\u201cApplicant continues to manage the income/expenses shortfall by either reworking his budget to find\nfunds, by obtaining another high interest loan, or by adding to an already existing high interest loan.\nApplicant acknowledged that financially he is living \u2018on the edge.\u2019\u201d Decision at 4.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for trustworthiness, reliability, and the ability to\nprotect classified information.  His supervisors and project managers are aware of his problems with\nthe IRS.\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s installment agreements,\nthe high opinion which his witnesses expressed of his trustworthiness, and Applicant\u2019s having held\na security clearance since 1974 without incident.

Feb. 12, 2009), quoting ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).\nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s prior good security record is not a bar to an unfavorable adjudication.  As\nwe have previously held, the Government need not wait until an individual mishandles or fails to\nsafeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security clearance decision.\nISCR Case No. 08-00435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009), citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-\n239 (D. C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).   \n1\nApplicant observes that the security concerns in his case were based upon events occurring\nprior to the implementation of the current Adjudicative Guidelines.  Therefore, he argues that it was\nimproper for the Judge to have decided the case against him based on those Guidelines.  We construe\nthis argument as a contention that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the Directive.\nHowever, a Judge is bound by the provisions of the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-00939\nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007).  Furthermore, the Board\u2019s authority is limited to reviewing a case for\ncompliance with the Directive.  We do not have authority to entertain challenges to the wisdom,\nlegality or constitutionality of provisions of the Directive or of policy decisions of the Department\nof Defense.  See ISCR Case No. 03-23190 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 99-0457\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001).

Implementation of Adjudicative\nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, Directive, Enclosure 2,\nat 16-17.  Therefore, the application of the current Guidelines in Applicant\u2019s case is in accordance\nwith guidance from DoD, included in the Directive.  The Judge did not err in applying these\nGuidelines.   \n2\n\nApplicant notes that the Department Counsel called no witnesses in support of the Government\u2019s case which,\n3\nhe argues, renders Applicant\u2019s evidence conclusive.  \u201cThe strength of the Government\u2019s own employee, [Witness C],\nwho could only be deemed to have the Government\u2019s best interests in mind, must be determined to be conclusive in\nestablishing [Applicant\u2019s] current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment with respect to the protection and\nhandling of classified information.\u201d  Applicant Brief at 17.  To the extent that this argument includes a contention that\nthe Government failed to meet its burden of production, we note that this burden arises only with regard to controverted\nallegations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  In this case, Applicant admitted the one allegation contained in the SOR.\nConsequently, this allegation was not controverted.  Nevertheless, the Government presented documentary evidence,\nincluding credit reports and a written statement by Applicant addressing his IRS problems.  Therefore, the burden of\npersuasion rested on Applicant to demonstrate mitigation under  the standard set forth in Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(1 -3), (5).\n4\n4\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his weighing of the evidence, citing to the\nopinions of the character witnesses called in Applicant\u2019s behalf and to evidence that he is making\npayments consistent with his installment agreement with the IRS.  He argues that the Judge ignored\nthe favorable testimony of these witnesses, which, he contends, demonstrates that Applicant should\nhave a clearance.   A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g.,\n3\nISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal has not rebutted that presumption.  The Judge\nexplicitly considered the matters cited by Applicant, but he provided a plausible explanation as to\nwhy he nevertheless concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in his case.\nApplicant has failed to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law, in light of the Judge\u2019s unchallenged findings concerning the extent\nof Applicant\u2019s debt, its ongoing nature, and Applicant\u2019s continued mismanagement of his finances.\nSee ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 12, 2007) (A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law).  \nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred by considering \u201cmatters which are clearly outside\nthe scope of the reasons stated in the SOR in reaching his conclusions.\u201d  Applicant Brief at 18.\nApplicant has provided no support for this contention.  A review of the decision, in light of the\nrecord as a whole, demonstrates that the Judge based his decision upon Applicant\u2019s admissions in\nhis response to the SOR and upon the record evidence bearing on Applicant\u2019s debt to the IRS, his\nresponse to that debt,  and his financial stability.  The Judge also considered evidence that Applicant\nhad prior difficulties with the IRS.  Such evidence is relevant in evaluating the whole-person factors\nprescribed in the Directive, especially the nature, extent, and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, including Applicant\u2019s knowledge; the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; and the presence or absence of rehabilitation or other behavioral changes.   There is\n4\nnothing in the Judge\u2019s decision to demonstrate or suggest that he gave improper weight to these\nmatters.  \n\n5\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant is a 59 year old electrical and systems engineer employee of a defense contractor performing document reviews to determine contractor compliance with government requirements. He is a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He is a graduate of the Air Force Reserve Office Training Corps (ROTC) program, and served over seven years on active duty in the Air Force and over ten years in the Air Force Reserves. He has held a security clearance since 1974. He has been married since 1976, and all of his children are grown. He worked for various defense contractors since leaving active duty with the Air Force in 1981. He was with a previous defense contractor employer from August 1997 until February 2009. He has been with his present defense contractor employer since February 2009. Applicant has 3 been continuously employed from 1974 until present except for the period from January 1994 until February 1995.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Roderic G. Steakley, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor on January 28, 2008. On February 24, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nMarch 5, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 18, 2009. He admitted the \nfactual allegation but denied the security concern based on the factual allegation. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on April 17, 2009. The case was initially assigned to another administrative \njudge, and reassigned to me on July 22, 2009. The previous administrative judge issued \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \na Notice of Hearing on June 24, 2009, for a hearing on July 14, 2009. That hearing was \npostponed. I issued a Notice of Hearing on July 30, 2009, for a hearing on August 18, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered 11 exhibits, \nmarked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 11. Five exhibits were admitted and \nsix were not admitted. Applicant and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He offered \ntwo exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A and B, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2009. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of nine of the eleven offered government \nexhibits. He objected to Government Exhibits, 2, 3, 4, and 5, credit reports and a letter \nfrom the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as irrelevant and hearsay. I admitted \nGovernment Exhibits 2, 4, and 5 as authentic, not hearsay as a business record, and \nrelevant to a determination of Applicant's security worthiness. I did not admit \nGovernment Exhibit 3 since it was cumulative with other government exhibits that were \nadmitted. \n \n \nApplicant objected to Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as irrelevant to a \ndetermination of Applicant's security worthiness. Government Exhibit 7 is an IRS \nmonthly statement concerning taxes owed for 1992 and 1998. Government Exhibit 8 is \nApplicant's statement in 2001 to security investigators concerning taxes owed from \n1998. Government exhibits 9 and 10 are handwritten statements by Applicant \nconcerning tax debts and other debts from 1989. Exhibit 11 is a 1989 statement to \nsecurity investigators from his corporate security official that Applicant has financial \ndifficulties and may file bankruptcy. The documents were not admitted since the \nfinancial security concerns were federal tax liens from 1989 and 1998 and are not \nrelevant to tax issues from 1999 to 2002 (Tr. 16-37). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 59 year old electrical and systems engineer employee of a defense \ncontractor performing document reviews to determine contractor compliance with \ngovernment requirements. He is a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in \nelectrical engineering. He is a graduate of the Air Force Reserve Office Training Corps \n(ROTC) program, and served over seven years on active duty in the Air Force and over \nten years in the Air Force Reserves. He has held a security clearance since 1974. He \nhas been married since 1976, and all of his children are grown. He worked for various \ndefense contractors since leaving active duty with the Air Force in 1981. He was with a \nprevious defense contractor employer from August 1997 until February 2009. He has \nbeen with his present defense contractor employer since February 2009. Applicant has \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbeen continuously employed from 1974 until present except for the period from January \n1994 until February 1995. Applicant stated that his loyalty to the United States has \nnever been challenged and he has never compromised classified information (Tr. 103-\n116, 150-152; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated January 28, 2008). \n \nThe credit reports and IRS documents that were admitted into evidence show \nthat Applicant is indebted to the IRS for tax years 1999-2003 in the approximate amount \nof $42,848.14 (SOR 1.a). However, Applicant also acknowledged that he had previous \nfederal tax issues in 1992, 1995, and 1998. He acknowledged that he did not have \nsufficient funds to pay his taxes for tax year 1992. He had moved from one company to \nanother and withdrew his retirement funds from the previous employer. He was advised \nby the IRS that he had to pay interest and a penalty for withdrawal of the funds. His tax \ndebt was over $12,000. He entered an installment agreement with the IRS in 1995 for \npayment of the 1992 taxes. (Tr. 116-121. 175-180; Gov. Ex. 2, Credit report, dated \nAugust 12, 2009; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated February 15, 2008; Gov. Ex. 6, Lien, \ndated September 14, 2004; Gov. Ex. 7, Monthly IRS statement, dated May 16, 2001). \n \nApplicant filed his federal tax returns on time from 1995 until 1998. Applicant \ncould not pay in full his federal taxes due for tax years 1995 and 1998. In 1995, he had \nended a period of unemployment and received full salary. The taxes owed were about \n$700 to $900 but he did not have funds available for payment. In tax year 1998, \nApplicant made more than expected and again owed about $2,300 in federal taxes but \ndid not have funds to pay. Applicant never adjusted his tax withholding after 1995 or \n1998. He tried to meet his tax debt by earning more income in order to have additional \nfunds to use to pay taxes. Applicant's tax debt for these years was added to the 1995 \ninstallment agreement. The installment agreement was completed in 2005 and the \ntaxes have been paid (Tr. 133-142, 180-185).  \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file federal tax returns for tax years \n1999 and 2000. Applicant claims he could not file on time because his wife was ill after \nknee surgery and he could not obtain records for his wife's in-home bridal gown \nbusiness. She earned about $3,500 per year but her expenses at times exceeded her \nbusiness income. Applicant was notified by the IRS in 2003 that he had not filed his \n2000 tax return. However, the IRS calculated his taxes and assessed penalties. When \nnotified that he did not file his 2000 federal tax return, he also discovered that he had \nnot filed his 1999 Federal tax return. He voluntarily notified the IRS of his failure to file \nthe 1999 Federal tax return. Applicant also noted that at the time he had a medical \nproblem that caused him to be easily distracted and led to some short term memory \nloss (Tr. 121-128; App. Ex. A, IRS Account Transcript, dated July 13, 2009; App. Ex. B, \nDoctor's letter, dated October 1, 2001). \n \nApplicant entered into an installment agreement in early 2005 with the IRS to pay \n$433 a month until the tax debt for 1999 and 2000 was paid. After approximately 18 \nmonths, the IRS terminated the agreement and requested payment of the entire sum \nowed. Applicant notes that he made all of the payments required up to that point, and \ndo not know why the installment agreement was cancelled. By this time, however, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant also had tax payments owed for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003. Applicant \nmade an Offer in Comprise to the IRS for his entire tax debt which was rejected. He \nsubsequently negotiated a new installment agreement with the IRS in September 2008 \nto make payments of $760 month on his entire tax debt until the debt is resolved (Gov. \nEx. 5, Installment agreement, dated August 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant never adjusted his tax withholding after realizing he owed federal taxes \neach year. He tried to earn more income to pay his federal taxes rather than adjust his \nwithholding. He timely filed his federal tax returns for tax years 2004 through tax year \n2008 and paid all amounts due (Tr. 128-133, 142-150; App. Ex. A, Tax Account \nTranscript, dated July 13, 2009). \n \nApplicant made payments in October and November 2008 on the installment \nagreement with the IRS. He was notified by his employer in December 2008 that his \nposition may be eliminated because of lack of funds. He notified the IRS he may be laid \noff and the payment on his installment agreement was deferred. His position was \neliminated in January 2009. He started working with his present employer on February \n9, 2009. He has timely made every payment under the installment agreement. He \nestimates his present debt to the IRS at approximately $38,000 (Tr. 150-156, 194-197). \n \nApplicant's yearly salary at his previous employer was until December 2008 \n$92,000. His expenses many months exceeded his income. In general, he had very \nlittle, if any, discretionary funds left each month. Applicant used high interest \n(sometimes as high as 40%) short term loans to obtain funds to make ends meet and \npay bills many months. Two or three of these loans are still outstanding and he pays on \nthem each month. When he started working for his present defense contractor in \nFebruary 2009, his yearly salary increased to $122,500. Applicant labeled this as a \n\"whopping big\" salary increase. The increase was partially off-set by increased medical \ninsurance costs of about $12,000 to $15,000. However even with this increase in salary, \nhis expenses many months are still more than his income. Applicant continues to \nmanage the income/expenses shortfall by either reworking his budget to find funds, by \nobtaining another high interest loan, or by adding to an already existing high interest \nloan. Applicant acknowledged that financially he is living \"on the edge\" (156-194). \n \nApplicant's former supervisor testified that she has a bachelor's degree in \nmathematics and a master's degree in computing information sciences. She has held a \nsecurity clearance for over 34 years. Applicant worked directly for her from March 2008 \nuntil December 2008. She observed his daily work and also received reports from \nothers concerning Applicant's work. She is aware of Applicant's tax problems since he \ninformed her that he had Federal income tax issues. She has no reason to doubt his \nloyalty to the United States or his work ethic. She has never observed any actions by \nApplicant that would compromise his integrity or honesty. He has never given her any \nindication that he would intentionally or consciously compromise classified information. \nShe believes he is reliable, trustworthy, and has the ability to protect classified \ninformation. She would currently trust him with classified information (Tr. 40-62). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe government employee who oversaw Applicant's work as a government \ncontractor testified that he has a bachelor's degree in computer science and has worked \nas a government contractor and government employee. He has held a security \nclearance for many years. Applicant was a government contractor supporting his office \nand operation. He saw Applicant on a daily basis. Applicant is loyal, has an excellent \nwork ethic, is knowledgeable about his work, and follows security rules and regulations. \nIt is his opinion that Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and reliable. He has not observed \nApplicant exhibit any actions that raise questions concerning his access to classified \ninformation. He is aware that Applicant has financial problems relating to payment of \ntaxes. He does not believe Applicant would intentionally or consciously compromise \nclassified information. He would recommend Applicant for access to classified \ninformation (Tr. 62-82). \n \nThe project manager for Applicant's former employer testified that he has been \nwith the company working on the same project for over 30 years. He has a bachelor's \ndegree in electrical engineering and served on active duty with the Air Force. He has \nheld a security clearance from his active duty service in the Air Force through his \nemployment with the government contractor. Applicant worked on the project for him \nfrom 2000 until December 2007. He saw Applicant frequently and also received reports \non his work performance. Applicant was always dedicated to the project. He never had \nany reason to question Applicant's work ethic. He never saw Applicant exhibit any \nbehavior which would cause him to question Applicant's honesty or integrity. Applicant \nexercised good judgment and demonstrates a willingness to abide by rules and \nregulations concerning security matters. He is aware of Applicant's financial problems \nrelating to the payment of taxes. He would trust Applicant with classified information (Tr. \n82-103). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's failure to file tax returns for 1999 and 2000, as well as a history \nof tax debts as listed on the credit reports and in IRS documents are a security concern \nraising financial consideration disqualifying conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual federal, state, or local income \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same). Applicant had tax payment \nissues as early as 1992. These tax filing and payment issues in the SOR started in \n1999. Applicant's federal taxes are still being paid under an installment agreement with \nthe IRS. These facts show Applicant has a history of an inability or unwillingness to pay \nhis federal tax obligations. \n \n \nI considered the financial considerations mitigating conditions (FC MC) that were \nraised by Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply. Applicant has had continuous issues with filing and paying \nhis federal taxes. There have been two installment agreements with the IRS for \npayment of taxes. His present agreement still has a debt of over $38,000 and covers tax \nyears from 1999 to 2003. Applicant's history of tax debt as well as his present finances \nindicates that his tax debt issues could recur. His long standing failure (until at least \n2003) to restructure his finances to enable him to meet his federal tax obligations each \ntax year casts doubt on this reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant attributes his \ntax problems to his failure to consider the tax consequences of a withdrawal from his \nretirement account, his failure to find the necessary information on his wife's business to \nfile his returns, and a medical problem affecting his ability to concentrate and focus. \nTaxes are inevitable and something every financially responsible person knows is \nrequired to be paid. Applicant started experiencing his present tax issues in 1999 and \nthey continue today with his installment agreement still at a balance owed of over \n$38,000. The problems cited by Applicant were not largely beyond his control but well \nwithin his ability to manage. He should have inquired about or known, as a reasonable \nperson, about the tax consequences of the early withdrawal of his retirement account. \nWith due diligence, he could have determined the tax consequences of his wife's \nbusiness. There is no indication that his medical problems were so severe that it \naffected his ability to file his tax return. Once he had federal tax issues, Applicant did not \ntake responsible and reasonable actions to adjust his finances to provide for payment of \nhis taxes. He tried to increase his income as a means of paying his taxes. Higher \nincome means higher taxes. When his income increased, he still encountered federal \ntax issues. This mitigating condition does not apply.  \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". For FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded. The applicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual \ndebt payments or reduction of debt through payment of debts. The entirety of an \n\n \n8 \n \n \napplicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in response can reasonably be considered \nin evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Applicant should demonstrate that he has \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.   \n \n \nApplicant owed federal taxes from 1999 and 2003. In 2005, he entered an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS to pay his past due taxes. This agreement was not \nbased on the good-faith action of Applicant but an action required by the IRS to collect \nfederal taxes. In fact, when Applicant continued to incur federal taxes that he could not \npay, the IRS terminated the initial installment agreement seeking immediate payment of \nthe tax debt. Applicant's Offer in Compromise was rejected. Applicant and the IRS \nagreed to a new installment agreement and Applicant is paying that agreement now. \nThis latest installment agreement is not based on Applicant's good-faith but the tax \nenforcement and collection requirements of the IRS. Applicant has not presented \nsufficient information to indicate a good-faith effort to pay the IRS and resolve the tax \ndebt. Accordingly, Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's active duty \nand reserve Air Force service, and his good reputation for honesty, integrity, and \nreliability. I considered his supervisor's evaluation of his work performance and their \nopinions that he be granted access to classified information. I also considered that \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1974 and there are no indications of any \n\n \n9 \n \n \nsecurity violations. In fact, all indications are that he has correctly managed classified \ninformation.   \n \nTo overcome financial considerations security concerns, an applicant must show \na \"meaningful track record\" of financial management. Reliable information about the \nApplicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in \nreaching a determination. Applicant must demonstrate that he has a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and has taken significant actions to implement that plan. The entirety \nof Applicant's financial situation and actions must establish that Applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness and management of his finances are credible \nand realistic.  \n \nApplicant has established that he is paying his past due federal tax debt under an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS. However, he has not shown that he has responsibly \nand reasonably managed his finances. His finances are in disarray and he is \"chasing \nhis tail\" financially. For a number of years, he has failed to take into account his federal \ntax burden thus incurring a federal tax debt. He has been gainfully employed since 1974 \nexcept for a 15 month period. Even while gainfully employed, he has incurred federal \ntax debt because of his unwillingness or inability to manage his finances to account for \nhis tax responsibilities. His continued inability to manage his finances to have sufficient \nfunds to pay his federal taxes when due does not instill confidence that his finances are \nunder control and he will manage to pay his future federal taxes when due. He not only \nfailed to reasonably manage his taxes responsibly, he has not been reasonable and \nresponsible in managing his entire financial obligations. His annual income is $122,500 \nbut he still manages to live on the edge financially. He just received a \"whopping\" pay \nraise but he still is living day to day financially. In fact, his expenses are more than his \nincome and he often resorts many times to high interest loans to pay his bills. He has \nnot established that he is living within his means. The evidence indicates that he is \nfinancially overextended.  \n \nApplicant is irresponsible in managing his finances. His finances are not sound in \nthat he does not live within his means, is overextended financially, and does not \nresponsibly manage his high income to meet his current financial obligations. This \ninformation indicates poor self-control, a lack of good judgment, and unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, resulting in questions concerning Applicant's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information, Applicant has not \nestablished he is suitable for a security clearance because he has been irresponsible \ntoward his finances indicating he will be irresponsible towards the safeguarding of \nclassified information. He has not established he is reliable, trustworthy, and exercises \ngood judgment. I reach these conclusions even though Applicant had access to \nclassified information since 1974 and there have been no indications of any security \nviolations or concerns.

Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.

In any case, a review of the record shows that Applicant was sent a\ncopy of the record to be considered by the Judge, along with a cover letter dated November 7, 2008,\nwhich advised her that \u201cBefore the file is sent to the Administrative Judge, you have an opportunity\nto review the attached copy of the complete file and to submit ant material you wish the\nAdministrative Judge to consider or any objection you may have to the attached file material.\u201d  It\nalso said  \u201cIf you do not file any objections to the attached material or submit any additional\ninformation within 30 days of receipt of this letter, your case will be assigned to an Administrative\nJudge for a determination based solely on the attached file of relevant material.\u201d  The record\ndemonstrates that Applicant submitted no objections or additional information.

She served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from January 1999 to March 2006, and attained the rank of petty officer second class (paygrade E-5). She was unemployed from April 2006 to May 2006, and worked as an administrative assistant from May 2006 until she obtained her current employment.

The record does not indicate if she received a degree from the university. Applicant has been married since November 2003. She has a four-year-old son. Her decision to leave the Navy after almost eight years of service was based on family considerations. She did not anticipate the period of unemployment she experienced following her release from active duty and attributes her current financial problems to that unemployment.

Although she sought Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in May 2008, two\nbankruptcy petitions she filed in 2006 were previously dismissed and there is insufficient\nevidence to warrant a finding that her financial problems are going to be resolved through\nthe current petition.  \nOn July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR, dated August 25, 2008, and requested a decision based\non the written record without a hearing. She admitted all SOR allegations except those\ncontained in subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 27,\n2008, which was mailed to Applicant on November 7, 2008. Applicant was informed she\nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit her objections to any information\ncontained in the FORM or to submit any additional information she wished to be\nconsidered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on November 13, 2008, but did\nnot submit a response to the FORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within the\ntime allowed her. The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed as an operations controller by a\ndefense contractor since September 2006. She served on active duty in the U.S. Navy\nfrom January 1999 to March 2006, and attained the rank of petty officer second class\n(paygrade E-5). She was unemployed from April 2006 to May 2006, and worked as an\nadministrative assistant from May 2006 until she obtained her current employment.\nApplicant was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in paralegal studies in June 2005, and she\nattended a university from August 2005 until October 2006. The record does not indicate\nif she received a degree from the university.\nApplicant has been married since November 2003. She has a four-year-old son. Her\ndecision to leave the Navy after almost eight years of service was based on family\nconsiderations. She did not anticipate the period of unemployment she experienced\nfollowing her release from active duty and attributes her current financial problems to that\nunemployment. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on September 18, 2006. She\nexplained in her response to the SOR that she and her husband struggled unsuccessfully\nto stay current on their bills but decided their only option was to seek bankruptcy\nprotection. According to the information contained in the Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) she filed in or about February 2008, she had only been\nunemployed for approximately one month following her release from active duty, and, as\nshe stated in her response to the SOR, the employment she obtained in May 2006 was \u201ca\ngreat opportunity with decent pay.\u201d \nThe September 2006 bankruptcy petition was dismissed on October 17, 2006,\nwithout a Chapter 13 plan having been filed. Applicant explained in her response to the\nSOR that the petition was dismissed because she missed a court date due to her need to\nattend her grandmother\u2019s funeral. \nApplicant again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on October 24, 2006.\nApparently, a plan was approved because the case was dismissed on February 22, 2008,\nfor failure to make payments. Applicant explained in her response to the SOR the dismissal\nwas because she and her husband missed two payments due to her husband being laid\noff from his job for over a month beginning in October 2007. \n\n3\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection a third time on May 20, 2008.\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant stated she and her husband were currently making\npayments on their debts, presumably under an approved plan, and their goal is to be\ncaught up on their delinquent debts or have them paid off by the end of 2009 or in early\n2010.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d lists a collection account owing in the amount of $4,887.\nApplicant denied this allegation and asserted it was a student loan that had been\nconsolidated with other student loans. She did not provide any evidence in support of her\nclaim. This account is listed in her credit bureau report (CBR), dated October 27, 2008, as\nremaining unpaid. Likewise, she denied the $60 medical bill alleged in subparagraph 1.e\nby asserting it had been paid without providing any evidence to support her assertion. This\naccount in also listed in her October 27, 2008 CBR as being unpaid.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g list accounts owing to a credit union that had been\ncharged off as bad debts. The account listed in subparagraph 1.e, owing in the amount of\n$4,056, represents a credit card debt. The account listed in subparagraph 1.f, owing in the\namount of $30,238, was for an automobile loan. The creditor on these two accounts is\nlisted on four occasions as a creditor in Applicant\u2019s May 2008 bankruptcy filing, so it is\nlikely these accounts are included in that filing. \nThe accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.h through 1.m, owing in the total\namount of $33,433, arise from student loans that had been in a deferment status. All these\naccounts are included in Applicant\u2019s May 2008 bankruptcy filing. \nWithout specifying the nature of the debts or the amount owing on the debts, SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c alleged Applicant listed 21 separate delinquent accounts in her May\n2008 bankruptcy filing. Applicant admitted this allegation. Most of the creditors listed in the\nMay 2008 bankruptcy filing are in addition to the those listed individually in the SOR. Those\ncreditors include an insurance agency, a department store, a jewelry store and an athletic\nclub, among others. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s CBR, dated March 18, 2008, on page 6 lists\ntwo collection accounts with dates of last activity indicating they became delinquent and/or\nhad been submitted for collection while Applicant was still on active duty in the Navy.  \nApplicant submitted letters from her military and civilian supervisors. They attest to\nher being a dedicated and valued Sailor and employee who has earned a reputation for\nbeing dependable and reliable. She possessed a security clearance for almost her entire\ntime in the Navy. There is no indication in the record that any prior adverse action was ever\ntaken to revoke or downgrade her security clearance eligibility.  \n              \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v.

Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\n\n5\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant acquired numerous delinquent accounts that caused her to first seek\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2006. That petition was dismissed\nbecause she reportedly missed a court date. She refiled for bankruptcy protection in\nOctober 2006, and that petition was dismissed for failing to make the required payments\nin February 2008. She has now filed a third time for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection and\nindicated in her SOR response that she is making required payments under a plan. She\nfailed to provide any evidence in support of that assertion. The May 2008 petition lists\nnumerous creditors in addition to those specifically alleged in the SOR. Finally, Applicant\ndenied two of the allegations in the SOR, but she failed to submit any evidence in support\nof the reasons she provided for those denials. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.\nApplicant attributes the origin of her financial problems to an approximate one-\nmonth period of unemployment she experienced after voluntarily deciding to end her\nservice with the Navy. She did not provide any further explanation for her financial\nproblems or any evidence in support of her assertion. Further, the record indicates at least\ntwo accounts were delinquent and may have been submitted for collection while she was\nstill in the Navy. Other than filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on two occasions\nin 2006, months after she obtained full-time employment at what she herself described as\na decent wage, Applicant did not provide any evidence to support a finding that she acted\nin a responsible manner to either prevent the financial problems she encountered or to\nresolve them in a timely manner. Finally, she allowed her second bankruptcy petition to be\ndismissed for failing to make required payments with her only explanation for the dismissal\nbeing that her husband was laid off from his job for about a month. Thus, Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances does not apply.\nApplicant has once again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. While she\nclaims she is making payments to resolve her debts and she hopes to be current with all\nher debts within about the next two years, she did not submit any proof she actually is\ncurrent on the plan. Additionally, the record is devoid of any information concerning\nApplicant\u2019s family income and expenses or other information to warrant a finding that she\nwill be able to successfully complete any bankruptcy plan that may be in existence and\nthereafter live a financially responsible lifestyle. Accordingly, MC 20(a): the behavior . . .\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(c): the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not apply.  \n\n6\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including the letters of reference Applicant submitted, the action\nshe has thus far taken to bring her finances under control, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1\nthrough \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\nI find Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. She has\nnot overcome the case against her nor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant:  Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 13, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 17, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about March 13, 2009, and requested a \nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on April 17, 2009, and issued a Notice of \nHearing on April 28, 2009. The case was heard on May 12, 2009 as scheduled.  \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C \ninto evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil May 28, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted AE D and E that were admitted into the record without \nobjection from the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 22, \n2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the four allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR and \nprovided some explanations. Those admissions are incorporated herein.  \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and married. They have five children, two of whom are \nstill in high school. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1980 and retired in January \n2002 as a 1st Sergeant (E-8). He earned a Bronze Star for Desert Shield and was a \nmember of the Amy\u2019s elite Audie Murphy Team and Army\u2019s Sergeant Morales Club. He \nhas held a Secret security clearance for about 15 years. \n \n \nAfter retiring from the Army, Applicant started working for the Army as a leader of \n\u201ca civilian group on the battlefield simulating war efforts to help train soldiers that were \ngoing to Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d (Tr. 16) In 2006, he became a range inspector for the \nArmy. In December 2007, he started a position with a federal contractor in which he \ntrains soldiers in the use of computer systems on the battlefield. In March 2007, he \nearned a Bachelor of Arts in Human Services. He also serves as a minister for his local \ncommunity.    \n \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred in 1999, 2001 and 2003 when \nhis wife, who operates a home day care center, lost a large number of the children \nbecause families relocated, as a result of deployments. (Tr. 76) In 1999, they filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and discharged about $12,000 of debt, but maintained their home \nand cars. (Tr. 62)  Each time her child population decreased, so did the family income. \nFor example in 2003, her monthly income went from about $2,400 ($30,000 annually) to \n$900 monthly. In 2006, his salary went from $48,000 annually to $28,000 because he \nchanged positions. (Tr. 49-50) He acknowledged that some of his previous financial \nproblems resulted from overspending and mismanaging the home budget. (Tr. 65-66) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts, totaling $34,679. The status of the debts \nis as follows:  \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a medical bill for $110 that was incurred for one of his children. It \nwas originally for $95.00. Applicant paid it on March 9, 2009. He thought \nTricare paid it. (GE 3 at 1; AE D; Tr. 31-32) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6 1.c for $972 and $10,597 are both associated with the \npurchase of a vehicle for Applicant\u2019s wife. The balance as of May 29, 2009, is \n$14,148. He has paid $600 over the past couple months and intends to \ncontinue making monthly payments. He stopped making payments in \nNovember 2006. He has attempted to work out a repayment plan with the \ncreditor, but has been unable to do so. He then decided to make monthly \npayments regardless. This debt was charged off sometime in late 2007. (Tr. \n35-42; AE A at 1-4; GE 5 at 6-7) \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1. d for $23,000 is an automobile repossession. Applicant resolved the \ndebt with a $2,000 payment on May 26, 2009. He was unaware of this debt \nuntil he was contacted by a government investigator regarding his e-QiP. He \nknew the car had been sold. (AE B; Tr. 47-52) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant paid three of the delinquent debts and is making \npayments on the remaining $14,148 debt. According to his budget, he has a net \nmonthly income of $6,700. After paying expenses of $2,018 and making payments on \ndebts of $2,168, he has approximately $1,900 remaining. (GE 2 at 15) He and his wife \nwork within that budget. (Tr. 75) He does not use credit cards, but his wife has one. She \nis aware of the potential effect that their financial issues are having on his employment. \n(Tr. 77) Since learning of these delinquent debts in November 2007, he sought credit \ncounseling with a law firm. The firm has disputed several debts. (AE E) He pays $42 per \nmonth for their assistance. (AE E; Tr. 79) He is managing the household budget now. \n(Tr. 85) \n \n \n \nApplicant presented his case in a very forthright and candid manner. He has an \nimpressive background of superior leadership and is humbled and apologetic for his \ncurrent financial situation. He realized in November 2007 that he needed help managing \nhis finances and obtained it. He has worked diligently to resolve his debts. (Tr. 84) He \nloves his job of training soldiers. (Tr. 83) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations that began in 1999 \nwhen he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Those problems continued until approximately \nNovember 2007, when he started to resolve them. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing since \n1999, are not isolated and relate to financial mismanagement to some degree. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has limited application. Some of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose as a result of \nhis wife\u2019s loss of income and at one point his reduction in salary. Those circumstances \nwere beyond his control; however, there is no evidence that during those periods when \nhis income was reduced, he took steps to responsibly manage his financial obligations, \nwhich is necessary for establishing the full application of this condition. AG \u00b6 20(c) is \n\n \n \n \n \n6\napplicable. After learning of the problems in November 2007, he consulted a credit \ncounseling firm to begin resolving his problems. At this time, there are \u201cclear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has made a good-faith effort \nto pay three of the four debts and is making monthly payments on the last debt, such \nthat AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable. The credit counseling company has filed disputes on \nsome of the debts over the past year, in an attempt to resolve them, warranting the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(e). There is no record evidence pertinent to the application of AG \n\u00b6 20(f). \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 noted \u201cthat an applicant is \nnot required to show that she completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has \nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u2019  ISCR Case No. 04-0684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).\u201d In this \ninstance, Applicant presented sufficient credible evidence that he established a plan to \npay the remaining delinquent debt and took steps to resolve the other three debts listed \nin the SOR.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 46-year-old veteran, \nwho honorably and significantly served in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years. He \ntakes full responsibility for his financial problems and is humbled by them. He was a \nvery credible witness and is aware of the importance of managing his obligations, as is \nhis wife. There is no other derogatory information in the record that would lead me to \nbelieve that his current financial situation would create future security concerns or that \nhe will renege on his current repayment obligations. To the contrary, I am convinced \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nthat he has the financial ability to continue resolving his financial obligations and \nestablishing a solid financial track record. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:       \n   For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSHARI DAM \n Administrative Judge \n",

On April 27, 2009,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information\nTechnology Systems), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\n\nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s favorable findings and conclusions under Guideline H.\n1\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that the evidence did not support a finding that Applicant viewed child pornography on\nhis office computer; (2) whether the Judge erred by failing to consider Sexual Behavior\nDisqualifying Condition \u00b613(b); (3) whether the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant mitigated\nthe government\u2019s case under Guideline D; (4) whether the Judge erred by not considering\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions \u00b616(c),(d), and (f); (5)\nwhether the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant mitigated the government\u2019s case under\nGuideline E; and (6) whether the Judge\u2019s \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis failed to account for significant\ncontrary record evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant began work with his current company in February 2006.  He has received favorable\ncomments about his high-quality work and ability to \u201chit the ground running.\u201d  He has not had any\ndisciplinary issues at this job.  Applicant has held a security clearance for most of the last 34 years,\nwithout any violations or accusations of mishandling classified information.  \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s son was killed.  Applicant and his family were devastated.  Applicant\nbriefly attended a grief counseling program to support his wife, but refused any other form of\ncounseling.  Instead, he internalized all his grief and began suffering from insomnia, which affected\nhis ability to do his job.  \nApplicant completed his master\u2019s degree in 2003, about four months after his son died.  He\nexpected some type of recognition from his employer for this accomplishment.  He did not get any\nrecognition or a promotion.\nJust before the first anniversary of his son\u2019s death, Applicant inadvertently opened a\npornographic web site on his office computer.  He closed the link immediately.  However, about a\nmonth later, he searched for the site again.  Thereafter, he began accessing pornographic sites and\nchat rooms on his office computer.  At first, he accessed the sites once a month, then twice a month,\nthen weekly, and sometimes daily.  He would break off his internet pornographic activities for weeks\nor months, but then he would return to the sites and chat rooms even though he felt absolutely horrid\nwhen he did so.  Applicant denies deliberately accessing or seeking out child pornography sites or\nreceiving such sites by e-mail.  He remembers seeing pictures of young women, who he believed\nwere in their twenties.  \n\n3\nOther staff could view what Applicant was doing on the computer.  Applicant and three other\nco-workers had computers.  Two other day employees and three night shift employees also used\nthese four computers.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him informally to stop what he was doing without\nspecifically mentioning his pornographic activity.  Applicant knew what his supervisor meant when\nshe made this statement to him.  When he did not end his conduct, Applicant\u2019s employer fired him\nfor misuse of its computer equipment in November 2005.  Applicant then decided to cease his\npornographic activities.  Applicant acknowledged that his pornography viewing violated company\npolicy and that he knew he violated company policy when he accessed these sites.    \nIn 2006, Applicant interviewed for his present position.  During his interview, he advised the\ninterviewer that he had previously been fired for misuse of company equipment but did not tell the\ninterviewer that pornography was involved.  Applicant told his new security officer the full story two\nor three days after he began his job.  Because of his disclosure, his current employer monitored his\ncomputer use for two years.  Applicant also acknowledged that he did not tell his wife the true reason\nfor his termination in 2005.  He explained that he decided not to tell her because he was concerned\nfor his welfare and ashamed of what he had done.  He recently told his wife the true reason for his\ntermination.  At her suggestion, he started counseling in August 2009 to understand the reasons for\nhis conduct.  He believed the change in his behavior began with his son\u2019s death in 2002 and the\nensuing problems of insomnia and anger.  \nAt the time of his firing in 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer confiscated his computer and\nexamined his hard drive, which revealed multiple visits to pornographic sites, including child\npornography.  Applicant raised a concern about this report because he was never told that he was\nfired for child pornography.  He acknowledged that child pornography may have been found on his\ncomputer, but he denies he sought it out or placed child pornography on his computer.  Applicant\ndoes not believe he viewed child pornography, but he could not be certain.  \nThe FBI conducted a CART review of Applicant\u2019s computer hard drive.  The CART review\nlocated a number of images of suspected child pornography.  Neither the FBI nor the United States\nAttorney took any further action.  The record contains no evidence explaining the CART review or\nexplaining the extent of the search of Applicant\u2019s computer files.  \nWhen operating his computer at his former employer, Applicant could look at his internet\nexplorer file history, a software program which showed the sites he had visited.  He did not know\nhow to access his hard drive.  At times, he encountered problems shutting down the pornographic\nweb sites he visited.  Sometimes, when he attempted to close the web site, the web site would\ncascade to multiple sites and open new web sites.\nDiscussion\nAs Department Counsel does not specifically challenge the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, the\nissues raised on appeal are more appropriately analyzed in terms of challenges to the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  This analysis is included in the following section.\n\n\u201c[U]nauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\u201d\n2\n\u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances,\n3\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n\u201c[S]exual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d\n4\n\u201c[S]exual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d\n5\n\u201c[S]exual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d\n6\n4\nConclusions\nThe Judge reached the following pertinent conclusions: \nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline M, \u00b640(e)  as\n2\nApplicant accessed pornography web sites on his work computer on many occasions over a period\nof two years. He knew this conduct violated his company\u2019s policies on computer use, but he did it\nanyway.  Applicant\u2019s conduct occurred during a specific period in his life after his son\u2019s death and\nafter he received his master\u2019s degree and his employer failed to acknowledge his accomplishment.\nSince Applicant never participated in grief counseling, his grief began to surface in other ways.\nApplicant\u2019s termination from his job made him realize the need to change his behavior and he did.\nThere is little likelihood that the behavior will occur again because the tragic death of Applicant\u2019s\nson is an unusual event.  Applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct occurred four years ago and has stopped.\nBecause he otherwise acted appropriately and has changed his attitude and behavior, Applicant\u2019s past\nconduct does not cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline M, \u00b641(a).   \n3\nUnder Guideline D, the government established a case under  \u00b613(c),  and \u00b613(d).   Applicant\n4\n5\nadmitted that he had a concern that his wife would learn about his pornographic activities, and this\nconcern could make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress.  In addition, Applicant\nviewed pornography on his work computer. The images could be seen by his co-workers.  Regarding\n\u00b613(a),  the custodian of the records for Applicant\u2019s former employer stated that security found child\n6\npornography on Applicant\u2019s computer, but the custodian provided no information which explains\nhow the security staff determined that Applicant had actually viewed pornography.  The FBI found\nsuspected child pornography on Applicant\u2019s hard drive, but the FBI report fails to provide concrete\ndetails about these findings.  The existence of possible child pornography on his computer hard drive\nby itself is insufficient to establish that Applicant actually viewed child pornography.  The FBI has\nsophisticated computer software programs capable of showing when and how long Applicant viewed\nchild pornography, if he did.  The record does not contain this information.  The Judge concluded\nthat Applicant did not actually access any child pornography sites.\n\nSpecifically, \u00b614(b)(the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual\n7\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individuals\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.) and \u00b614(c)(the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.)\n5\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline D.   Applicant\u2019s\n7\nsexual conduct stopped four years ago when he lost his job.  He buried his grief after the death of\nhis son and this decision and a feeling that his employer did not appreciate him eventually led to\ninappropriate use of his work computer.  His son\u2019s death is a highly unusual event and is unlikely\nto happen again.  His past conduct does not cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\nBecause of his inappropriate conduct in his work place for two years, Applicant placed\nhimself in a position of vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  His decision to lie to\nhis wife about the reason for his job termination also put him in a position of vulnerability.  The\ngovernment established a case under Guideline E.  After losing his job, Applicant acknowledged the\nreason for his termination to all who needed to know.  He has taken responsibility for his conduct\nand acknowledged it was wrong.  He finally started counseling to understand why he viewed\npornography.  He is a reliable employee and has always protected government information and\nmaterials.  With his counseling, he is taking steps to assure that he will continue to protect\ngovernment classified information and materials and not place himself in a position of vulnerability.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.\nUnder the whole person concept, Applicant\u2019s viewing of pornography and the decision to lie\nto his wife about the reasons for his termination showed poor judgment, but Applicant has otherwise\nexercised good judgment in his life.  Applicant has taken the appropriate steps to assure that his\ninappropriate conduct will not occur in the future.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201c[N]o one\nhas a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel first asserts that the Judge erred by finding that Applicant did not view\nchild pornography and by not applying the provisions of Guideline D, \u00b613(a).  Department Counsel\nstates that the record contains sufficient evidence to establish the government\u2019s case under the\n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, that the Judge imposed a requirement for the production of evidence\n\nTr. p. 36.\n8\n6\nakin to those found in criminal proceedings and that the Judge improperly shifted the burden to the\ngovernment to refute Applicant\u2019s testimony that he could only speculate as to why his employer and\nthe FBI found child pornography on his computer hard drive.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have\nmerit.\nIt is well established in industrial security clearance cases that the question of whether there\nis sufficient evidence to support a Judge\u2019s factual findings is a matter of law, not one of fact.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996).  The deference afforded a trier of fact is\nnot absolute.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0178 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 1996).\nThe record evidence regarding child pornography contains two documents.  The first is a\nsummary from the company records custodian indicating that the company\u2019s security office\nconfiscated Applicant\u2019s hard drive and examined it in detail.  Security found instances of obscene\nand/or sexually explicit materials, \u201cto include child pornography\u201d on the hard drive.  The second is\nan FBI document and indicates that an FBI agent received the original hard drive from security\npersonnel at Applicant\u2019s company.  According to the document, a CART review located a number\nof images of suspected child pornography on the drive.  This evidence, which includes corroboration,\nwas sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s burden of establishing that Applicant viewed child\npornography.  The burden of persuasion then fell to Applicant to refute the evidence that he had\nviewed child pornography.\nAlthough not a model of clarity, the Judge\u2019s theory on the issue of whether Applicant viewed\nchild pornography appears to be that, because pornographic web sites \u201ccascaded\u201d onto Applicant\u2019s\ncomputer while Applicant was viewing pornography, images of child pornography could end up on\nApplicant\u2019s hard drive without Applicant having necessarily viewed them.  The only source of the\nevidence regarding \u201ccascading\u201d was the testimony of Applicant.  Applicant offered some vague and\nconfusing testimony concerning his understanding of the relationship between the internet, software,\nand hard drives, but at no time during his testimony does he hold himself out as an expert in such\nmatters, and at no time does he state that the child pornography images on his hard drive were the\nresult of \u201ccascading\u201d nor does he offer a clear explanation for why child pornography images could\nbe found on his hard drive without his ever viewing them.  No fact or opinion testimony from a\nwitness versed in the properties or operations of computer hard drives and internet web sites exists\nin the record.  Any explanation by Applicant in support of his position that he did not view child\npornography despite the contents of the hard drives is speculative, and in his testimony he identifies\nit as such.   The Judge is required to consider an Applicant\u2019s testimony, as she would any other\n8\nportion of evidence.  However, that evidence must be evaluated in terms of its inherent probative\nvalue and considered in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-\n0620 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 1999).  Given the state of the evidentiary record in this case, there is\ninsufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant successfully rebutted the\ngovernment\u2019s case establishing that Applicant viewed child pornography.   \n\n\u201c[A] pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may\n9\nbe symptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d\n7\nThe Judge commits further error on this point by bolstering her conclusions through a critique\nof the state of the evidence.  She complains about the lack of specificity in the government\ndocuments evidencing Applicant\u2019s viewing of child pornography, noting that the company document\nprovides no explanation as to how the security staff determined that Applicant had actually viewed\nchild pornography.  Likewise, the Judge complained that the FBI report failed to provide concrete\ndetails about the findings on Applicant\u2019s hard drive.  In making these comments, the Judge is\nrequiring a standard of proof that exceeds the substantial evidence standard.  See, generally, ISCR\nCase No. 07-16511 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009)(\u201c[T]he Government must produce substantial\nevidence of the truth of the allegation.  Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d)(citing to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).\nThe two documents submitted by Department Counsel satisfy the substantial evidence requirement.\nThe evidence provided by Applicant in an attempt to rebut that evidence is vague and speculative.\nWhile more detailed evidence would have been useful in this case, the Judge resolved perceived\nevidentiary insufficiencies to the detriment of the government, as if the government rather than\nApplicant bore the burden of persuasion.  This was error.\nDuring her critique of the state of the evidence, the Judge also recites supposed capabilities\nof the FBI in developing hard evidence which could show when and how long Applicant viewed\nchild pornography.  In addition to being unnecessary, these comments in the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nsection are also purely speculative as they contain matters wholly outside the evidentiary record and\ndo not appear to be matters that are properly the subject of administrative or official notice,\nespecially without citation to appropriate sources.\nDepartment Counsel next contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline D Disqualifying\nConditions failed to consider significant record evidence that establishes the applicability of \u00b613(b).9\nDepartment Counsel notes Applicant\u2019s own hearing testimony where he testified he could not stop\nhimself from returning to the pornographic sites and stated he had become addicted to viewing\npornography. The record evidence also shows that Applicant\u2019s risky behavior continued even though\nApplicant knew what he was doing could be readily seen by co-workers, Applicant was fully aware\nthat his conduct was contrary to company policy, and persisted in the conduct after being told twice\nby his supervisor to stop doing it.       \nAn Administrative Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.\nSee Directive, Section 6.3 and Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25.  In this case, the Judge\nconcluded  that Applicant\u2019s viewing of pornography was prompted by unusual circumstances\nunlikely to occur again, and she concluded that his recent commencement of counseling constituted\na step to assure that he will not again place himself in a position of vulnerability.  An evaluation of\neither of these conclusions would be affected by any record evidence suggesting that Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior was addictive or uncontrollable.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has mitigated the\n\n8\ncase against him must be evaluated in light of that evidence.  Consequently, the Judge\u2019s failure to\nevaluate the case with reference to \u00b613(b) was error.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s case under Guideline D failed to take into account significant contrary record evidence\nand was unsustainable.  Department Counsel is correct in asserting that there is record evidence that\nsignificantly undercuts the main points of the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis, namely that Applicant\u2019s\ndisqualifying sexual behavior is mitigated by the passage of time, unusual circumstances, and the\nlack of a continued basis for coercion.  \nDepartment Counsel is correct that the mere passage of time cannot be viewed in isolation,\nand must made be evaluated with reference to other facts and circumstances in the case.  In this case,\nthe Judge did not take into consideration the evidence that Applicant viewed child pornography and\nApplicant\u2019s refusal to take responsibility for it.  Whatever mitigating value attaches to the passage\nof time since the conduct, it is seriously diminished by Applicant\u2019s failure to acknowledge the\nmisconduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0625 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 1998).  Thus, the Judge\u2019s\nheavy reliance on Mitigating Condition \u00b614(b) is misplaced.  The same failure to acknowledge on\nthe part of Applicant also undercuts to a degree the application of Mitigating Condition \u00b614(c) as\nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion and exploitation on the issue of viewing child\npornography.\nThe Judge\u2019s analysis of the \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d prong of \u00b614(b) is also flawed.  While\nthe Judge could properly consider Applicant\u2019s explanations that his viewing of pornography was a\nresult of his grief over his son\u2019s death and his feeling that his company was unappreciative of his\naccomplishments, it is error not to subject that testimony to critical analysis.  It is arbitrary and\ncapricious for a Judge to accept uncritically a witness\u2019s testimony without considering whether it is\nplausible and consistent with other record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0620 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 19, 2001).  Here, there is no objective evidence outside Applicant\u2019s testimony that\nestablishes a nexus between the death of his son and his behavior.  There is nothing in the record to\nestablish that resorting to the viewing of pornography is a typical or rational expression of grief, nor\nis there any explanation for why this behavior did not occur until the passage of a year after the death\nof Applicant\u2019s son. The speculative nature of Applicant\u2019s explanations regarding his behavior is\nunderscored by the fact that he has only recently had his first counseling session, and his counselor\nindicated at that time that he had minimal opportunity to explore and/or evaluate Applicant\u2019s insights\nregarding his prior use of pornographic materials. \n Regarding Applicant\u2019s other explanation\u2014 he was unhappy with his company\u2014 the Judge\u2019s\ndecision fails to explain how Applicant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his employer, arguably a fairly\ncommon phenomenon in the working world, is an unusual circumstance or is one unlikely to occur\nagain.  The Judge also fails to articulate how this manifestation of discontent with his employer is\nan unusual circumstance to the extent that it does not cast doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  Also, these facts raise the legitimate question that if Applicant\u2019s\nviolation of company rules was a product of his dissatisfaction with his employer, what would\nApplicant\u2019s proclivities be if he became disenchanted with security rules or the U.S. government.\n\n In pertinent part, \u00b616(e) provides \u201c[P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\n10\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . .\u201d   \nConsideration of these matters would involve applying \u00b616(c) and \u00b616(d) which expressly provide for a whole-\n11\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.       \n9\nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not address this point.  Department Counsel is correct in asserting that\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the case under Guideline D fails to adequately\nanalyze the security-significant facts.                            \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E was too narrow in\nscope.  The Judge applied Disqualifying Condition \u00b616(e)  which addresses vulnerability to\n10\ncoercion.  Not included in her analysis of Applicant\u2019s conduct were considerations of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.   The Guideline E allegations in the SOR include\n11\nreferences to the misuse of company computers and the viewing of pornography brought under other\nGuidelines plus the allegation that Applicant did not tell his wife the true reason for his firing until\nat least November 2007.  Inasmuch as the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s activities involving his company\ncomputer for separate consideration under Guideline E, and included Applicant\u2019s failure to tell his\nwife about the true reason for his 2005 termination as an additional important aspect of the case, the\nJudge was required to consider the security significance of these actions under all parts of Guideline\nE that reasonably applied.  This would include considerations of questionable judgment and\ndishonesty.  The Judge\u2019s failure to do so was error.\nDepartment Counsel also questions the Judge\u2019s application of various Guideline E mitigating\nconditions.  The mitigating conditions under Guideline E cited by the Judge are similar to the\nmitigating conditions considered by her under Guideline D, and, as argued by Department Counsel,\nthe Judge committed errors in her Guideline E analysis that are similar to the errors committed in\nthe Guideline D mitigation analysis.  An additional matter in the Guideline E analysis is the Judge\u2019s\nreliance on the fact that Applicant has begun counseling.  The Judge concluded that with this\ncounseling, Applicant is taking steps to assure that the will continue to protect classified information\nand avoid being placed in a position of vulnerability.  Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s\nsubstantial reliance on the commencement of counseling is misplaced.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nassertion has merit.\nThe record indicates that Applicant had only one session with this counselor, which took\nplace just a week before the hearing.  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s testimony reveals that he began\nseeing the counselor to comply with his wife\u2019s wishes.  In the counseling session, Applicant totally\ndenied any involvement with child pornography, notwithstanding the record evidence to the contrary.\nAfter the session, Applicant\u2019s counselor noted that he had minimal opportunity to evaluate\n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s insights into the use of pornographic materials.  These facts seriously reduce the\nsignificance of counseling as a matter in mitigation.  \nLastly, Department Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis under the whole person concept.\nDepartment Counsel is correct in stating that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is essentially a repeat\nof facts cited within her Guideline D and Guideline E analysis.  Department Counsel asserts that the\nerrors in analysis occurring earlier in the decision are repeated here.  This assessment is correct, and\nthe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis contains no new matters that would rectify the errors described\nheretofore, nor does it provide an independent, sustainable basis for her overall favorable security\nclearance decision.\n \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\n   \nSigned: Jeffery D.

He answered the\nSOR in writing on May 22, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request on May 27, 2009. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on July 30, 2009, and I received the case assignment on August 5,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 28, 2009. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through\n6. GE 1, GE 2, and GE 4 to GE 6 were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted five exhibits (AE) A\nthrough E, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 4, 2009. I held the record open\nuntil September 11, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters. He timely\nsubmitted two exhibits, AE F and AE G, without objection. The record closed on\nSeptember 11, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on August 17, 2009. (Tr. 9.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9-10.) \nEvidentiary Ruling\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not specifically object to GE 3, which is a page from\nthe Report of Investigation (ROI) containing information on an interview.  Applicant was\nadvised that this evidence may not be admissible and then asked if he objected to its\nadmissibility. After a discussion, Applicant agreed to the admission of GE 3.  (Tr. 15-16.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n2.a, 3.a, and 3.b of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as an senior engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He began his employment with this company in February 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations reflect that he generally meets his performance\nobjectives and occasionally exceeds his performance objectives. In his 2008\nperformance evaluation, he received  favorable comments about his high-quality work\nand ability to \u201chit the ground running.\u201d He successfully completed his tasks and\nsuccessfully aided a program in its critical phase. He has not had any disciplinary issues\nat this job.  \n1\n\nGE 1; GE 4; AE G; Tr. 34.\n2\nResponse to SOR; GE 4; Tr. 27-28.\n3\nTr. 28-29.\n4\nId. at 30, 49.\n5\n3\nApplicant enlisted in the United States Army in 1975 and served on active duty\nuntil 1983. Following his discharge from the Army, Applicant worked in private industry,\nincluding other federal contractor positions. He has held a security clearance for most of\nthe last 34 years, without any violations or accusations of mishandling classified\ninformation. He also returned to school. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 and a\nmaster\u2019s degree in March 2003. He completed the course work for his Ph.D, but he has\nnot written his dissertation and is not presently working on it or enrolled in school.\nApplicant has three hobbies: motorcycling, amateur radio operating, and scuba diving.\nHe worked with his state to develop a program which improves motorcycle safety and is\na certified motorcycle safety trainer. He trains other amateur radio enthusiasts, and he\nis training to become a search, rescue, and recovery diver.2\nApplicant and his wife married in 1980 and had two sons. His older son, who is\n28 years old, is a member of the United States Navy and works as a youth pastor in a\nchurch where he lives. Applicant\u2019s younger son joined the United States Marine Corps,\nwhere he worked as a military policeman. On November 15, 2002, his younger son, at\nage 20, was killed performing his duties in the Marine Corps. To the best of Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge, his son\u2019s death is still under investigation.3\nHis 20-year-old son\u2019s death devastated him, his wife, and his older son.\nFollowing his son\u2019s death, his wife received medical care for depression for a period of\ntime. She also attended grief counseling. Applicant briefly attended a grief counseling\nprogram to support his wife, but refused any other form of counseling. Instead, he\ninternalized all his grief. He began suffering from insomnia, which affected his ability to\ndo his job.                                   \n4\nApplicant completed his master\u2019s degree in March 2003, about four months after\nhis son died. He expected some type of recognition from his employer for this\naccomplishment. He did not get any recognition or a promotion.5\nJust before the first anniversary of his son\u2019s death, Applicant conducted an\ninternet search for \u201cporcelain dolls\u201d on his computer. He wanted to buy his wife a doll for\nher collection and as gift. He hoped this gift would help her feel better. His internet\nsearch led to an innocuous link, which he opened and learned that it was actually a\npornographic site. He closed the link immediately. However, about a month later, in late\n2003, he searched for the site again. Thereafter, he began accessing pornographic\nsites and chat rooms on his computer. At first, he accessed the sites once a month,\nthen twice a month, then weekly, and sometimes daily. He would break off his internet\n\nTr. 30, 46-47. \n6\nId. at 37, 39, 53.\n7\nId. at 39-40.\n8\nId. at 25, 32, 48-49.\n9\nId. at 55, 52. \n10\n4\npornographic activities for weeks or months, but then he would return to the sites and\nchat rooms, even though he felt \u201dabsolutely horrid\u201d when he did so.6\nApplicant described his pornography activities in two ways. He viewed\npornography sites and spent a lot of time in pornography chat rooms. He denies\ndeliberately accessing or seeking out child pornography sites or receiving such sites by\ne-mail. He remembers seeing pictures of young women, who he believed were in their\ntwenties.7\nApplicant worked daily with six co-workers. His work area had a back room,\nwhere four computers were installed in cubicles with low partitions. Staff could view\nwhat he was doing on the computer. Applicant\u2019s job required him to have computer\naccess. He and three other co-workers had computers. The two remaining co-workers\nand the three co-workers who worked the evening and night shift also used these four\ncomputers.8\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor told him, informally, to \u201cstop what he was doing\u201d without\nspecifically mentioning his pornographic activity. He knew what she meant when she\nmade this statement to him. When he did not end his conduct, his employer fired him for\nmisuse of its computer equipment in November 2005. Applicant described his\ntermination as \u201chitting rock bottom.\u201d He decided to cease his pornographic activities. He\nquit accessing pornographic computer sites \u201ccold turkey\u201d and successfully achieved his\ngoal because he did not have access to an office computer for three months. He never\naccessed pornography sites on his home computer, which he kept in plain view of his\nwife.9\nTo his knowledge, Applicant is the only individual who was fired for misuse of a\ncomputer. He acknowledged that his pornography viewing violated company policy and\nthat he knew he violated company policy when he accessed these sites.10\nIn February 2006, Applicant interviewed for his present position. During his\ninterview, he advised the manager interviewing him that his prior employer fired him for\nmisuse of company equipment. He did not tell the interviewer that his misuse related to\npornography. During his intake interview, which occurred within two or three days after\nhe began his job, he told the security officer the full reason for his termination by his\nprevious employer. Because of his disclosure, his current employer monitored his\ncomputer use for two years. His first two performance evaluations contain a\nperformance objective related to compliance with computer and network use policies.\n\nAE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 23-25.\n11\nGE 6; AE F; Tr. 26, 31, 33.\n12\nId. at 59.\n13\nGE 3; Tr. 35-37.\n14\n5\nBoth times his employer evaluated his performance on these goals as \u201cmeets\nobjectives.\u201d  His employer removed this performance goal from his 2008 performance\nplan.11\nApplicant acknowledged that he did not tell his wife the true reason for his\ntermination in 2005. He explained that he decided not to tell her because he was\nconcerned for her welfare and ashamed of what he had done. He recently told his wife\nthe true reason for his termination. At first, she was very angry. They talked. At her\nsuggestion, he started counseling in August 2009 to understand the reasons for his\nconduct. Since he had no past history of this conduct and his only vice is smoking, he\nbelieved the change in his behavior began with his son\u2019s death in 2002 and the ensuing\nproblems of insomnia and anger. He never actively participated in grief counseling and\nstill feels responsible for his son\u2019s death because he encouraged him to join the\nMarines.  \n12\nApplicant indicated that for a long period of time, he was concerned that his wife\nwould learn about the real reason for his termination. Since telling her, he is no longer\nconcerned that someone else would tell her or hold this information over him as a\nthreat.13\nThe record does not contain Applicant\u2019s personnel records related to his\ntermination. The security investigator interviewed the records custodian for his prior\nemployer and prepared a one-paragraph summary of the interview. According to the\nrecords custodian, Applicant\u2019s personnel file reflects that co-workers noticed Applicant\nviewing inappropriate internet sites and reported his conduct. His employer confiscated\nhis computer and examined his hard drive, which revealed multiple visits to\npornographic sites, including child pornography. Applicant raised a concern about this\nreport because he was never told that he was fired for child pornography. He\nacknowledged that child pornography may have been found on his computer, but he\ndenies he sought it out or placed child pornography on his computer. He does not\nbelieve he viewed child pornography, but he could not be certain.14\nApplicant\u2019s former employer forwarded his computer to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) for review. The FBI conducted a CART review of Applicant\u2019s\ncomputer hard drive. The CART review located a number of images of suspected child\npornography and forwarded the drive and other collected or derivative evidence to\nanother office. Neither the FBI nor the United States Attorney took any further action.\n\nGE 5.\n15\nTr. 36-37, 57.\n16\n6\nThe CART review is not explained. The record contains no evidence explaining the\nextent of the search of Applicant\u2019s computer filed.15\nApplicant could look at his internet explorer file history, a software program,\nwhich showed the sites he had visited. He did not know how to access his hard drive. At\ntimes, he encountered problems shutting down the pornographic web sites he visited.\nSometimes when he attempted to close the web site, the web site would cascade to\nmultiple sites and open new web sites. To stop this cascading, he shut down his\ncomputer.16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n7\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information\ntechnology systems:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nUnder AG \u00b6 40, the following disqualifying condition raises a security concern in\nthis case:\n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology\nsystem.\nApplicant accessed pornography web sites on his work computer on many\noccasions over a period of two years. He knew that this conduct violated his company\u2019s\npolices on computer use, but he did it anyway. The government has established a prima\nfacie case under AG \u00b6 40(e).\nApplicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 41. The\nfollowing mitigating conditions may apply in this case:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred during a specific period in his life. His 20-year-old\nson died in 2002 under tragic circumstances. Four months after his son\u2019s death, he\nreceived his master\u2019s degree. His employer failed to acknowledge his accomplishment\nin any way. Although devastated by his son\u2019s death, Applicant never participated in grief\ncounseling. Instead, over time, his grief began to surface in other ways, such as\ninsomnia and an inability to focus on work and many activities. Just over a year after his\nson\u2019s death, Applicant started viewing pornography sites on his work computer,\nsomething he had not done in the past. Department Counsel argues that Applicant\naccessed the pornography sites to get back at his employer for not recognizing his\naccomplishments a few months earlier. The time between Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death and\nthe failure to recognize Applicant\u2019s educational accomplishment is only four months, an\ninsufficient length of time for anyone to overcome the unexpected and tragic death of a\nchild.\nApplicant lost his job in November 2005 because of his conduct. His termination\nmade him realize that he needed to change his behavior and he did. In the last four\nyears, he has not accessed pornography sites or misused his work computer. He told\nhis current employer the reason for his dismissal. Because of his disclosure, his\nemployer monitored his computer usage for two years. His performance standard\nreflected that he followed company policy and did not view pornography or misuse his\nwork computer. Applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct occurred four years ago and has\nstopped. There is little likelihood that it will occur again because the tragic death of his\nson is an unusual event and such an event is highly unlikely to occur again. Because he\notherwise acted appropriately and has changed his attitude and behavior, his past\nconduct does not cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline M.\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern as:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern. The following\nconditions may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and,\n\n9\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nApplicant admitted that he had a concern that his wife would learn about his\npornographic activities. This concern could make him vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or duress. In addition, Applicant viewed pornography on his work computer,\nwhich was by his co-workers. The government has established its prima facie case\nunder AG \u00b6 13(c) and 13(d).\nViewing pornography is not illegal, although possession of child pornography is\nillegal under federal and state law. Applicant denies he sought out child pornography or\nreceived any child pornography by e-mail. The custodian of the records for Applicant\u2019s\nformer employer stated that security found pornography, including child pornography,\non his computer, but the custodian provided no information which explains how the\nsecurity staff determined that Applicant had actually viewed child pornography. The FBI\nconducted a review of Applicant\u2019s computer hard drive and found suspect child\npornography. The FBI referred its findings to another office and the United States\nAttorney. No action was taken. Like the personnel records, the FBI report fails to\nprovide concrete details about the findings on Applicant\u2019s computer hard drive. The\nexistence of possible child pornography on his computer hard drive by itself is\ninsufficient to establish that Applicant actually viewed child pornography. The FBI has\nsophisticated computer software programs capable of developing hard evidence which\nwould show when and how long Applicant viewed child pornography, if he did. The\nrecord contains none of this information. Accordingly, I conclude that he did not actually\naccess any child pornography sites. Disqualify condition AG \u00b6 13(a) is not established.\nApplicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns about his sexual\nconduct under AG \u00b6 14. The following conditions may be applicable in this case:\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and\n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress.\nAs previously stated, Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct stopped four years ago when he\nlost his job. The death of his 20-year-old son devastated him. He failed to address his\ngrief openly and in a positive way. Rather, he buried his grief. This decision and a\nfeeling that his employer did not appreciate him eventually led to inappropriate use of\nhis work computer. His son\u2019s tragic and unexpected death is a highly unusual event and\nis unlikely to happen again. He has changed jobs and his evaluations reflect he is\nappreciated at his job. His past conduct does not case doubt upon his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline D.\n\n10\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing condition disqualifying in this case:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group.\nBecause of his inappropriate conduct in his work place for two years, Applicant\nplaced himself in a position of vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Not\nonly did his conduct place him in a position of vulnerability, his decision to lie to his wife\nabout the reason for his job termination also put him in a position of vulnerability. For\nnearly four years, he feared that his wife would find out about his conduct. The\ngovernment has established its prima facie case under AG \u00b6 16(e).\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant stopped viewing pornography four years ago after he lost his job. From\nthe beginning, he has acknowledged the reason for his termination to those who\n\n11\nneeded to know, except his wife whom he has told. He has taken responsibility for his\nconduct and acknowledged it was wrong. Since 2005, he has a new job and lives in a\nnew location. He is doing well in his job, as shown by his performance appraisals. His\nson\u2019s tragic death created the initial stressor, followed by his disappointment with his\nemployer. He finally started counseling to understand why he viewed pornography, an\naction previously out of character for him, and to help with his loss of his son. He is a\nreliable employee and has always protected government information and materials.\nWith his counseling, he is taking steps to assure that he will continue to protect\ngovernment classified information and materials and not to place himself in a position\nwhere he is vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, duress, or pressure. Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. His decision\nto lie to his wife about the reasons for his termination also showed poor judgment.\nApplicant has otherwise exercised good judgment in his life.\n\n12\nSeven years ago, Applicant and his wife received the most devastating news any\nparent can receive. Their 20-year-old son\u2019s death under tragic circumstances set in\nmotion a chain of events unfathomable by either. His wife, understandably, developed\nsevere depression, for which she received treatment. Applicant handled his grief\ndifferently. He internalized much of his grief. His method of grieving caused other\nproblems, including insomnia and loss of focus. Shortly after his son\u2019s death, his\nemployer disappointed him by not recognizing his educational accomplishments.\nEventally, Applicant engaged in behavior uncommon to him. He deliberately violated his\nemployer\u2019s policy about computer use by viewing pornography on his work computer off\nand on for two years, conduct which he has acknowledged was wrong. \nAfter his termination, Applicant decided he needed to correct his behavior and he\ndid. He told his new employer the reasons for his termination in November 2005, and\nagreed to have his work computer monitored. After two years of monitoring his\ncomputer usage, his employer stopped monitoring when Applicant demonstrated that he\ncould be trusted. The relationship of a husband and wife is personal and should not be\nscrutinized for decisions made. Knowing his wife and understanding how she was\ncoping with their son\u2019s death, Applicant made a decision personal to them. He worried\nfor a long time that she would find out the actual reason for his termination. Had he not\ntold her the truth about his termination, this worry could be a source of vulnerability for\ncoercion, exploitation, duress, or pressure for him to compromise classified information.\nSince she now knows about his inappropriate conduct, this security concern has been\nmitigated.\nApplicant\u2019s problems started after his son\u2019s death. Although the initial devastation\nhas passed, the loss he feels remains. He recognizes that he needed to explore all the\nissues related to his son\u2019s death and his subsequent conduct. With his wife\u2019s support,\nhe started counseling. Applicant\u2019s outside activities as a scuba diver, motorcyclist, and\namateur radio operator can provide different outlets for his feelings. Applicant has taken\nthe appropriate steps to assure that his inappropriate conduct will not occur in the\nfuture.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual conduct,\npersonal conduct, and misuse of information technology systems.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\ndischarge in September 2002. Since obtaining the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has\naccumulated over $17,000 in delinquent debt that has been submitted for collection or\ncharged off as bad debt and which remains unsatisfied. Clearance is denied.  \nOn November 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on February 18, 2009.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations, except those contained in subparagraphs 1.g\nthrough 1.l, and 1.n, and requested a hearing. At the hearing, Applicant moved to amend\nhis response to the SOR to allow him to admit all SOR allegations. That motion was\nallowed without objection.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 6, 2009, scheduling the hearing for June 2, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Department\nCounsel also submitted a document describing where in the exhibits admitted into the\nrecord the various accounts alleged in the SOR were listed. That document was marked\nas Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex. I) and made a part of the record. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-5 and\nadmitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on June 11, 2009.\n   \nProcedural Matters\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the allegation contained in\nSOR subparagraph 1.l based on her concession that it was a duplicate of the allegation\ncontained in SOR subparagraph 1.j. That motion was granted without objection. \nSeveral days after completion of the hearing, an envelope was delivered to me from\nthe DOHA mail room. Upon opening the envelope, I discovered it contained Applicant\u2019s\nmilitary records that had apparently been requested by Department Counsel sometime\nprior to the hearing. I immediately delivered the records to Department Counsel without\nreviewing them. Subsequently, on June 10, 2009, I received a pleading from Department\nCounsel entitled Request to Re-Open the Record. Following a conference call with\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant, I agreed to reconvene the hearing at the original\nhearing location.\nA notice of hearing was issued on June 19, 2009, scheduling the reconvened\nhearing for July 10, 2009. The hearing was reconvened as scheduled. The Request to Re-\nOpen the Record was marked as App. Ex. II and made part of the record. Department\nCounsel submitted a group of documents consisting of Applicant\u2019s military records that\nwere marked as AE 6 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified but\ndid not offer any additional documentary evidence. The transcript of the reconvened\nhearing was received on July 21, 2009.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old man who has been employed as an instructional designer\nby a defense contractor since June 2007. He graduated from high school in 1989, enlisted\nin the U.S. Army in August 1989, and he served continuously on active duty until he was\n\n3\ndischarged in September 1995, with a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions\n(General). (GE 6)\nApplicant held a top secret security clearance while he was in the Army. A Report\nof Unfavorable Information for Security Determination was filed against Applicant in late-\n1994 because:\nOn 7 November 1994, this detachment received written notification from\n(omitted) that (Applicant) was significantly behind on his Deferred Payment\nPlan payment. On 18 November 1994, this detachment received a call from\nthe (omitted) regarding a failure on the part of (Applicant) to pay his monthly\nchild support obligation of $500.00 to his wife. On 18 November 1994, this\ndetachment received a call from the Housing Office regarding (Applicant\u2019s)\nlate rental payment as far back as October 1994. (GE 5)\nAs a result of the above report, Applicant was ordered to move into a barracks and he was\nencouraged to initiate an allotment to pay his support obligation. Additionally, a local Bar\nto Reenlistment was imposed on him. However, his access to classified information was\nnot withdrawn. \nApplicant was notified by a memorandum, dated May 16, 1995, that action was\nbeing initiated to separate him from the Army based on a pattern of misconduct. The\nspecific reasons for his proposed separation were as follows:\n. . . on 24 Feb 95 you were counseled for your unauthorized presence in the\nCommander\u2019s office after duty hours; you were late for the 0615 PT\nformation on 27 Feb 95; you illegally housed your dependent son in the BEQ;\nyou returned from leave late on 22 Feb 95; you were counseled on 22 Feb\n95 for financial irresponsibility; you failed to obey a lawful order on 17 Jan 95;\nyou were counseled for not having POV insurance; on 18 Nov 94 you were\ncounseled for making a late rent payment; also on 18 Nov 94 you were\ncounseled for failing to pay monthly child support; you were significantly\nbehind on DPP payments in Nov 94; you received a Summarized Article 15\non 18 Aug 94 for disobeying an order and writing bad checks; you were given\na letter of reprimand on 19 Aug 94 for failing to obey a lawful order; on 29\nJun 94 you were counseled on dishonored checks and again on 21 Jun 94;\nand you wrongfully used a government vehicle from 17 Jun 94 to 21 Jun 94.\n(GE 6)\nApplicant\u2019s work history from the time he was separated from the Army until he\nbegan his current employment is as follows: January 1996 to April 1998 (investigations\nmanager); April 1998 to November 1999 (special investigator); November 1999 to\nDecember 2000 (sales representative); January 2000 to April 2002 (bartender/waiter); April\n2002 to November 2003 (store manager); November 2003 to November 2004\n(residential/commercial inspector); January 2004 to May 2007 (sales/network). He left his\nemployment as a store manager in November 2003 because his performance was alleged\nto have been unsatisfactory. He left his employment as a residential/commercial inspector\nin November 2004 because of alleged misconduct. Applicant disagrees with the reasons\n\n The account listed in subparagraph 1.l was withdrawn by Department Counsel and is not included\n2\nin this total. A comparison of the amount listed as owing in Applicant\u2019s CBRs, dated May 11, 2009 (AE 1), and\nJuly 19, 2007 (GE 3), convincingly establishes that the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o is a duplicate of the\ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.i and, therefore, the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o is not included in this\ntotal. Applicant testified he only had one account with the creditor that is listed in subparagraphs 1.h and 1.n.\nHe did not provide any documentation in support of that assertion and a comparison of the amounts listed as\nowing in his CBRs, dated May 11, 2009, and July 19, 2007, convincingly establishes they are not duplicate\naccounts.      \n4\ngiven by his employers as to why he was forced to leave these jobs by mutual agreement.\nIn the security clearance application he submitted in June 2007 (GE 1), Applicant explained\nhe lost the first job because he did not receive adequate guidance from his district\nmanager and he lost the second job because he disagreed with his employer on how to\nperform inspections and evaluate findings. \nApplicant was first married in September 1991. That marriage ended in divorce in\nMay 1998. Applicant has one 17-year-old child from that marriage. Applicant has been\nremarried since July 1999. He has two children, ages nine and seven, from this marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s wife did not work from the time of the birth of their first child in 2000, until she\naccepted a position with a university in 2007 that pays her approximately $1,200 per\nmonth. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in May 2002. He received a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in September 2002, which discharged approximately\n$54,000 in debt. Applicant attributes his need to seek bankruptcy protection to medical\nexpenses he incurred as a result of surgery his wife underwent to remove a cyst while she\nwas pregnant with their second child. He did not provide any documentation to establish\nwhat portion of the amount that was discharged in the bankruptcy was actually attributable\nto medical expenses.\nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent accounts, totaling over $11,000, that have been\nsubmitted for collection.  The SOR also alleges an account that was charged off as a bad\n2\ndebt in the amount of $7,052, which resulted from the repossession of an automobile. With\nthe exception of the delinquent accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.k, 1.n, and 1.p, each\nof the accounts listed in the SOR remains listed as being in a collection status in\nApplicant\u2019s CBR, dated May 11, 2009 (AE 1). The dates those accounts were submitted\nfor collection range from February 2006 to April 2008. These accounts all remain unpaid.\nApplicant testified his current financial problems arose from his inability to make the\nrequired payments on the delinquent debts while he was employed at a position in which\nhe was paid solely based on commissions. (Tr. 32) He also testified that since he began\nworking at his current job he has been able to pay his current debts on time as evidenced\nby the accounts listed in his CBR, dated May 11, 2009 (AE 1), but that he has not been\nearning enough to also make payments on his delinquent debt. (Tr. 32) He anticipates\nbeing able to satisfy his delinquent debts within about ten months now that his wife has\nresumed working full-time.

However, Applicant has not used the credit\ncounseling service to actually repay any of his delinquent creditors.      \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n6\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant was counseled about his financial affairs on several occasions while he\nserved in the Army. His continued financial irresponsibility eventually contributed to his\ninvoluntary separation from the Army with a General Discharge. He sought Chapter 7\nbankruptcy protection in May 2002, and he was granted a Chapter 7 discharge in\nSeptember 2002. He discharged approximately $54,000 in debt at that time. Since\nobtaining the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has allowed numerous accounts to become\ndelinquent. Those accounts, totalling over $11,000, were submitted for collection between\nFebruary 2006 and April 2008. Additionally, Applicant had an automobile repossessed\nwhich resulted in his liability therefore being charged off as a bad debt in the amount of\n$7,052. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\nDC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant has exhibited continued financial irresponsibility dating back to at least\n1994. He attributes his need to file for bankruptcy protection in 2002 to his wife\u2019s medical\ncondition. However, he did not provide any documentation to indicate what portion of the\n$54,000 that was discharged was actually medical debt. He continued to obviously live\nbeyond his means as exhibited by debts that began to be submitted for collection within\njust a few years after he was granted the bankruptcy discharge. Those debts were\nsubmitted for collection as far back as three and one-half years ago and as recently as one\nand one-half years ago. Applicant obtained the assistance of a consumer credit counseling\nservice in preparing a budget, but he has not utilized its assistance in actually resolving any\nof his delinquent debt. In fact, he has not made any meaningful effort to satisfy any of his\ndelinquent creditors. His assertion that he will be able to resolve all his delinquent debt\nwithin the next ten months now that his wife is working full-time rings hollow when\ncompared with his 15-year history of financial irresponsibility. \nI have considered the possible application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial\n\n7\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problems and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Based on Applicant\u2019s 15-year\nhistory of financial irresponsibility, I conclude none of these mitigating conditions apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. He has neither overcome the case against\nhim nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraphs 1.m & n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party\nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases de novo. Nor does it have\nauthority to grant an interim clearance so that Applicant can resolve her financial problems. See. e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008).  Applicant has not made an allegation\nof harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is\nAFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 31, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On June \n19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 9 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 19, 2008). GE 9 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nSeptember 22, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nand revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 7, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nrequest a hearing (GE 10). On August 6, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the \nhearing held on September 4, 2008, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GEs \n1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 22-23), and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-H (Tr. 23-\n26). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 and AE A-H (Tr. 23, 26-27). I \nreceived the transcript on September 12, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted several of the allegations in the SOR with explanations, and \ndenied four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.g). Her admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 64 years old (Tr. 6).4 She has almost three years of college (Tr. 6). \nShe majored in business and liberal arts (Tr. 6). She married in June 1966 (Tr. 57). Her \nsons were born in 1973, 1976 and 1976 (Tr. 58). She has held jobs off and on since \n1964 (Tr. 18). Her husband served on active duty to retirement in 1983 (Tr. 18-19). He \nserved in Vietnam and on a remote tour in Alaska (Tr. 18-19). He earned an advanced \ndegree in laser physics (Tr. 19). After he retired from active duty, he and his family \nmoved to Australia, where he worked as a contractor (Tr. 19). Her husband had \nemotional problems, and abused drugs (Tr. 59). There were various marital separations \nbetween 1988 and 1995 (Tr. 19, 59). Sometimes he moved out while she was at work, \nand did not leave a forwarding address (Tr. 59). These periodic abandonments were \nemotionally and financially devastating to Applicant. They were divorced in 1995 (Tr. 19, \n57). As a result of the divorce, she received $800 monthly from his retired pay, and child \nsupport for their youngest son (Tr. 57, 84). Her share of his retirement has increased to \n$1,107 monthly (Tr. 62). She currently receives $800 monthly from him for alimony, \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GE 10 (Response to SOR) is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n                                           \nwhich decreases by $100 \u201cas [she] reaches retirement age\u201d (Tr. 61). He did not elect \nthe Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), so the divorce court ordered him to purchase a \n$300,000 insurance policy (Tr. 84-85). Over the years, she has accrued eight or nine \nyears of federal civil service employment (Tr. 63). She worked for a large university from \n1995 to July 1, 2008 (Tr. 20, 64).  In the last nine years while working at the university \nshe was not laid off (Tr. 82). She does not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 7). \nApplicant wanted a clearance so she could get better employment, which would allow \nher to pay her delinquent IRS debt (Tr. 87). \n \nApplicant\u2019s ancestors have lived in the United States since the early 1700s (Tr. \n17). She said she is a direct descendent of a former president and war hero (Tr. 17). \nTwo ancestors fought at Gettysburg (Tr. 17). Her father served on active duty to \nretirement and was a prisoner of war in Europe during World War II (Tr. 17). She was \nraised on military bases (Tr. 17). She is close to her family (Tr. 18). She said, \u201cMy family \nhelped to establish and build this country, and in no way would I ever violate the trust of \nthe United States of America\u201d (Tr. 21-22). Applicant is totally loyal to the United States \nand she is a patriotic American.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant owes about $50,000 in delinquent federal taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, \nGE 10 at 1-2). She learned she had a federal tax problem around 1997 (Tr. 68, 86). She \nwas unable to pay the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (Tr. 69). Applicant filed for \nbankruptcy in 2005 and received a release from the IRS for three years of back taxes, \nbut her bankruptcy did not release all of her tax debt (Tr. 20). Starting in 2005, she \nreceived some assistance from a certified public accountant (CPA), who provided \nfinancial and tax advice without being paid (Tr. 69-70).5 The CPA communicated with \nthe IRS about resolution, but she did not know what the IRS said (Tr. 72). She was \nadvised that she had insufficient income to resolve her debts (Tr. 71). She needed a \nwell-paying job to resolve her tax debts (Tr. 72). She could not offer the IRS any \npayments, so there was little to discuss (Tr. 72).  \n \nIn 2005, her debts were discharged in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (Tr. 70, SOR \u00b6 \n1.h). She listed total liabilities of $142,234 and $21,510 in debt was discharged (GE 10 \nat 4). The IRS declined to release her tax debts for the years she filed late (Tr. 70, GE \n10 at 4). She received credit counseling about 17 years ago, when she lived in another \nstate (Tr. 71). She also received some counseling in connection with her bankruptcy (Tr. \n94-95).  \n \nThree SOR debts pertained to parking tickets: $205 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $200 (SOR \n1.e), and $150 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant\u2019s son, KB, is responsible for these three tickets. \nHe is 32 years old (Tr. 50). He lived with his mother until 2000 (Tr. 50). After KB moved \nout in 2000, Applicant supported him with money for school and money for gasoline (Tr. \n54). Currently, KB does not provide financial support to Applicant (Tr. 50). Currently, \n \n5 She paid the CPA $35 to do her annual taxes (Tr. 69). \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant occasionally provides groceries for KB, but otherwise she does not provide \nfinancial support for him (Tr. 50-51). Applicant provides a car to KB (Tr. 21, 51). The car \nis registered in Applicant\u2019s name, and he has some unpaid parking tickets that are his \nresponsibility (Tr. 21, 51). KB has difficulty paying his own rent (Tr. 52). KB has not \nmade any effort to pay the tickets and recently became unemployed (Tr. 52-53).    \n \nFor the medical debt for $50 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), she contacted the creditor and asked \nfor information concerning the debt (Tr. 21). She could not remember the address \nwhere she contacted the creditor (Tr. 78).    \n  \n \nApplicant is receiving a state university pension of $600 monthly. Her medical \ninsurance and her payment for her $10,000 life insurance policy are deducted from this \nstate retirement check (Tr. 65, 76-77). In 1997 or 1998, she learned she had a problem \nwith her state taxes (Tr. 66-67). She satisfied two of the state court judgments (Tr. 67). \nTwo tax liens were subsequently combined into a $10,000 state tax debt (Tr. 67, 85, \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, GE 3-5). The state garnishes $500 monthly from her state university \nretirement check (Tr. 20, 68, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i). She did not know when the \ngarnishment started, or how much she still owed the state (Tr. 68). She thought she still \nowed the state $10,000, but conceded she was not sure of the amount she still owed on \nher state tax debt (Tr. 73, 85-86).    \n \nBefore deductions her monthly income is $2,507 (Tr. 77-78). She thought she \nhad about $3,000 in a 401K account (Tr. 73-74). She took a $1,000 loan on her 401K \naccount to pay on her taxes (Tr. 73). She has about $400 in her checking account (Tr. \n75). She paid off a car loan 13 years ago (Tr. 75). She pays about $310 monthly for \nwater and electricity, and $75 monthly to her homeowners association (Tr. 76). The only \ngarnishment of her wages is the state tax garnishment previously discussed (Tr. 78).    \n \nAB Is Applicant\u2019s son. AB has a high level security clearance and is employed by \na government contractor (Tr. 35). Applicant supported AB until three years ago (Tr. 31-\n32). AB is now making a good salary and is providing financial assistance to this \nmother. Applicant rented a townhouse for eight years, and then AB decided to purchase \nit and rent it back to her (Tr. 30, 33, 36). AB\u2019s monthly mortgage payment is about \n$1,500 and she pays AB $800 monthly (Tr. 30-31, 33, 36-37). Applicant pays her own \nutilities (Tr. 37). AB also provided a car for Applicant to drive (Tr. 36).  \n \nRecommendations \n \nAB said Applicant\u2019s debts resulted from the termination of her marriage and the \ncare and support Applicant provided to her sons as they grew up and completed their \ncollege educations (Tr. 34). She is loyal to her family and friends (Tr. 34). AB \nrecommends approval of her clearance (Tr. 34-35). \n \nCB has held a Top Secret/SCI clearance (AE E). CB met Applicant and her \nhusband in July 1984, when they lived in Australia (Tr. 41). CB and Applicant were good \nfriends (Tr. 42). She has known Applicant about 24 years (Tr. 42).  Applicant was \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \ndevastated by her divorce (Tr. 44). Applicant\u2019s debt was primarily related to her tax \nproblems, and was definitely not caused by \u201chigh living\u201d or an extravagant lifestyle (Tr. \n45). She does not spend frivolously (Tr. 46). CB indicated Applicant was trustworthy, \nhardworking and compassionate (AE E). Applicant does not gamble, drink alcohol or \nuse illegal drugs (AE E). \n \nA Reserve Air Force Major and Ph.D. student, EF, met Applicant in 2002 at the \nuniversity where she worked (Tr. 102-103, 108). EF had frequent professional and \npersonal contact with her (Tr. 105). EF\u2019s family lives about two miles from Applicant\u2019s \nresidence (Tr. 107). EF and Applicant became friends (Tr. 104). Applicant assisted EF\u2019s \nwife when EF was deployed, and often babysat for EF\u2019s two young children (Tr. 104, \n109). Applicant is very dependable, loyal, compassionate, reliable, empathetic and \ntrustworthy (Tr. 106-106). \n \nProfessor WF was formerly the Department Chair at the university where \nApplicant was employed.6 WF has worked closely with Applicant at the state university \nfor nine years. WF held a Top Secret clearance when he was in the Army. WF \ndescribed her as highly reliable, trustworthy, responsible and diligent. She was \nentrusted with very sensitive university matters and always showed appropriate \ndiscretion and protected sensitive information. WF was aware of her financial problems \nand concluded she spent her funds on her family, ensuring the welfare of her sons. She \ndid not spend money frivolously. He recommended approval of her clearance. \n \nDistinguished Professor GR provided a letter strongly supporting approval of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance (Tr. 83). GR has known Applicant for more than ten \nyears. GR described her as very trustworthy, patriotic and extremely reliable. She \nprovided significant contributions to the university.     \n \nProfessor and Distinguished Scholar DS worked with Applicant at the state \nuniversity (AE H). DS\u2019 description of her hard work, loyalty, trustworthiness, and \ndedication to her employer and family were consistent with the statements of Professor \nWF (AE B), and Distinguished Professor GR (AE A). DS recommended approval of \nApplicant\u2019s clearance (AE H). \n \nJW has had frequent contacts for several years with Applicant and/or Applicant\u2019s \nson when she worked at the state university.7 JW is a missionary pastor. JW knew \nApplicant personally and professionally. JW considers her to be an excellent single \nparent, who is loyal and patriotic. JW recommends approval of her clearance. \n \n \n6 AE B is the source for the facts in this paragraph and AE A is the source for the facts in the next \nparagraph, unless stated otherwise.  \n \n7AE D and Tr. 80-81 are the sources for the facts in this paragraph and AE C is the source for the \nfacts in the next paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                           \nRM and his spouse have been Applicant\u2019s neighbors for 13 years (Tr. 81-82). RM \ndescribed her as gracious, considerate and trusted. RM recommends approval of \nApplicant\u2019s clearance. Another neighbor, DL, who has known her even longer, portrayed \nApplicant in similar and very positive terms (Tr. 80, AE F). DL emphasized Applicant\u2019s \nlove of wildlife, humanitarian interests, and support for her church, family and neighbors \n(AE F). Applicant is loyal, patriotic and eschews illegal and risky behavior (AE F). \nAnother neighbor, EP, who has known Applicant for 11 years, echoed the \nrepresentations of RM and DL, and recommended approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance \n(Tr. 79, AE G). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n8 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in her credit reports (GE 6 and 7), and her SOR response. \n \n9 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his or her burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nHowever, her denial of responsibility for some SOR debts is sufficient to refute some of \nthe SOR debts.    \n \nAs indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, she admitted she owes about $50,000 to the \nIRS, and about $10,000 to a state for delinquent taxes (GE 10 at 1-2). Her remaining \nSOR debts total less than $1,000 and are relatively insignificant. Her 2005 bankruptcy \nlisted $142,000 in debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The IRS has not been paid. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Applicant has not made any progress since 2005 resolving her $50,000 IRS debt. \nShe has been continuously employed more than 10 years. She did not provide sufficient \ndetails to explain why she could not make more progress on her IRS debt. She used her \n2005 bankruptcy to avoid paying some of her federal taxes. Her financial problems are \nnot isolated. The ongoing nature of the debt to the IRS is \u201ca continuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nShe receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d She has been paying her recent taxes. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), she receives partial mitigation because her financial situation was \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                           \ndamaged through her divorce. However, she did not provide sufficient information to \nestablish that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.10 Her divorce was in \n1995, and she received substantial benefits from her divorce. Her former spouse has \nnot missed payments because the payments come directly from the Department of \nDefense.  She did not prove that she made sufficient efforts to address her federal tax \ndebts.    \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have limited application. Applicant received financial \ncounseling more than ten years ago, and subsequently had financial problems. She \nreceived some financial counseling in connection with her bankruptcy, yet, she has not \nmade significant progress resolving her IRS debt. There are not \u201cclear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient information to \nestablish that Applicant showed good faith11 in the resolution of her $50,000 tax debt. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) mitigates her $50 medical debt and her son\u2019s parking tickets. \nAlthough she did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute\u201d with respect to these debts, I will give her credit for mitigating them because I \nfound her and her son to be credible concerning these debts. See Department \nCounsel\u2019s argument at 96. I will find For Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \nand 1.g in the decretal paragraph of this decision.   \n \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with the IRS casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her delinquent federal tax debt is about \n$50,000 and likely will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. She is an honest, \nhard-working employee and loving, compassionate mother who has successfully raised \nthree sons with little assistance from their father. Notwithstanding these positive \n \n10\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n11The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nattributes, she has not established her financial responsibility and that she has the \njudgment necessary to hold a security clearance. Based on my evaluation of the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. She has three years of college. She is not financially sophisticated. \nShe went though years of periodic abandonment by her husband, followed by a divorce \nin 1995. She was successful in obtaining a significant share of her husband\u2019s military \nretirement. She is also receiving a good salary and financial support from one of her \nsons as well as retirement from a state university. She is paying her $10,000 state tax \ndebt through garnishment. She has a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of repayment on her \nstate tax debt. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She \nreduced her tax debt using the lawful method of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy to discharge a \nsignificant portion of her debts. She successfully raised her sons overcoming obstacles \nand demonstrating her familial dedication and diligence. Applicant\u2019s father and her \nancestors have provided extraordinary service, contributions and sacrifices for the \nUnited States. She is clearly a patriot and is completely loyal to her country. Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation. Aside from the delinquent federal taxes and 2005 bankruptcy in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b and 1.h, (which are civil, non-criminal issues), she is qualified to hold a security \nclearance. Her other debts are current, being paid, or disputed.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is not sufficient to \nwarrant a clearance at this time. The overall amount of her debt owed to the IRS at \nabout $50,000 is substantial. She admitted she was aware that she owed the IRS \nmoney for years. She initially relied on a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2005 to avoid part of \n\n \n \n11 \n \nher federal tax debt to the $50,000 level. Her use of bankruptcy while lawful also \nhighlights how large her federal tax debt became. Having such a large delinquent tax \ndebt shows some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Failure to pay a fair \nshare of one\u2019s taxes shows avoidance of lawful responsibilities as a citizen and tax \npayer. For the remaining $50,000 of her IRS debt, she has done little to address that \ndebt. Her only plan is to obtain a clearance and higher paying employment and then use \nthe increased income to pay the IRS. Applicant learned of the security significance of \nher delinquent debt when she responded to the SOR. Her lack of real effort to resolve \nher delinquent IRS debt raises security concerns. Her handling of her IRS debt shows \nlack of responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude she has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.b: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 24, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDecember 19, 2008\n\nResponse to SOR.\n1\nGE 1 (Security clearance application) at 6, 7; Tr. 44-46, 59. His parents are in the process of divorcing. \n2\nTr. 33, 47, 62-64.\n3\n2\nDOHA received the request on October 16, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on October 27, 2008, and I received the case assignment on October 28, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on November 20, 2008. The government offered four exhibits (GE) 1 through\n4, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits at the hearing. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 1, 2008. I held the record open until\nDecember 5, 2008, for Appellant to submit additional matters.  On December 4, 2008,\nhe submitted eight exhibits, Appellant Exhibit (AE) A through H, without objection. The\nrecord closed on December 5, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on November 8, 2008. (Tr. 9.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive this notice 15 days\nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received on October 16, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.b and 1.e of the SOR.   \n1\nApplicant is 26 years old. He was born in Switzerland to Iranian parents. He\nimmigrated to the United States (U.S.) with his parents in 1984 and along with his\nparents, became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He is fluent in Farsi. He is single and engaged\nto be married. His mother continues to reside in the U.S., but his father resides in\nEngland. His speaks with his father every two or three months.2\nAs he grew up, his parents encouraged him to attend the best college that\naccepted him for enrollment. He graduated from high school in 1999 at age 17. He\nenrolled in a prestigious and expensive private university as expected by his parents.\nHis parents provided him with some spending money while in college, but did not pay\nhis tuition, books and housing as they lacked the financial resources. To finance his\neducation, he borrowed money through the federal government and private education\nloans. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology in 2003 with plans to\nattend medical school. He estimated he borrowed $110,000 in federal and private\neducation loans to pay for this education.   \n3\n\nTr. 34, 62.\n4\nGE 2 (Interrogatories to Applicant and his answer with attachments) at 52-54; Tr. 36-38, 60-61.\n5\nGE 2, supra  5, at 50; GE 3 (Credit report, dated November 7, 2008) at 21; AE B (Copy of bank statements);\n6\nAE C (Copies of cancelled checks) at 1, 3, 5; AE H (Payment profile on private loan); Tr. 25-28, 32, 41. I note\nthat the creditor for the private loans is asking Applicant to repay his debt at the rate of $18,000 a year, which\nwill pay his loans in full in about four years. Such payments are difficult when an individual must pay rent, buy\nfood and meet other ordinary living expenses.\n3\nBecause he believed he needed additional education to go to medical school,\nApplicant enrolled as a part-time student in a master\u2019s degree program at another\nprivate university in another city. His classes began in September 2003 and he\ngraduated in August 2008 with a master\u2019s degree in Public Health Administration. He\nborrowed approximately $60,000 through the federal education loan program to pay for\nthis education. He worked full-time while working on his master\u2019s degree.4\nIn September 2008, Applicant learned that he was being restructured out of his\njob, which ended on September 30, 2008. He began receiving $380 a week in\nunemployment in October 2008. He started a new job in pharmaceutical sales on\nDecember 1, 2008 at a salary of $62,000 a year plus a bonus. He estimates that his net\npay will be approximately $3,500 a month, which is about $1,000 more than his net pay\nin his last job. He has $600 a month in income from another source. If he has a security\nclearance, his fluency in Farsi would enable him to earn significantly more money at\nanother company.5\nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenses total $2,839, including $569 in school loan\npayments. His salary was being garnished at his last job at the rate of $448 a month.\nThe garnishment was for one of his federal loans. By the time his job ended, he had\npaid approximately $3,600 on this garnishment.\nAs a graduate student, most of Applicant\u2019s federal education loans were placed\nin deferment status. When he started graduate school, he believed that his private\neducation loans were also in deferment. He found out that he was wrong. As a result,\nhis two private education loans, totaling $65,000, went into default. He has attempted to\nwork out a payment plan for these loans, but the creditor requested a monthly payment\nof $1,500, which he could not afford. He paid the remaining $1,800 private education\nloan in full in November 2008.  \n6\nApplicant has 16 federal education loans. All but two of these loans are in\nforbearance, also called deferment, until May 2009. The two remaining loans are listed\nas defaulted. The largest of these two loans, $17,000 is guaranteed by a state\neducational services corporation. The State garnished his wages beginning in May 2008\nto pay this loan. The garnishment ended when he lost his job. He also entered into a\nrehabilitation plan with the State on this loan. Since May 2008, he has paid $175 a\nmonth in addition to the garnishment amount to return this loan to good standing. He\nanticipates that the loan will return to good standing in February 2009. Applicant has\n\nGE 2, supra note 5, at 22, 53-54; AE B; AEC, supra note 6, 2, 4; Tr. 30, 40, 54..\n7\nGE 2, supra note 5; GE 3, supra note 6; GE 4 (Credit report, dated February 13, 2007); Tr. 42-43\n8\n4\nalso entered into a rehabilitation program for the second loan in default. He started\npaying $94 a month in May 2008 to rehabilitate this loan. He expects that this loan will\nalso be rehabilitated in February 2009. Once these loans are in good standing, he plans\nto consolidate all his federal loans into one monthly payment. He believes that once he\nrehabilitates his defaulted loans, the garnishment will end.7\nApplicant denies owing the one remaining debt, a cell phone, alleged in the SOR\nas he has no knowledge of the debt. The credit report he obtained in June 2008 did not\nshow this debt nor does the February 13, 2007 credit report. He learned about the debt\nwhen he received the government\u2019s proposed exhibits in this case.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity \nconcerns. \nApplicant \naccumulated \nsignificant \ndebt \nwhile \nattending\nundergraduate and graduate school.  He has been unable to pay his education loan\nobligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His debts are\nrecent and current. Thus, the mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) do not apply in this case. \n9\n6\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  As he grew up,\nApplicant=s parents instilled in him the idea that he should attend the best college he\ncould. Based on his upbringing, he chose a prestigious private university for his\nundergraduate education. His parents advised him to borrow the funds he needed to\npay for his education, as they lacked the resources to pay. At age 17, he relied on their\nadvice. He was too young and inexperienced in financial matters to realize that this\nadvice would cause him problems later and to understand the future financial impact to\nhim. He made a reasonable decision based on the information given to him. He lost his\njob in September 2008. Despite his job loss, he continued to pay the previously agreed\nupon payment plans for his education loans. He started new employment on December\n1, 2008. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not contacted a credit counseling service to\nhelp resolve his delinquent debts. He has acted on his own to resolve his debts. He\ninitiated a rehabilitation plan for two of his delinquent federal education loans in May\n2008. He has complied with the repayment plan. He has fully resolved an $1,800 private\neducation loan. He, however, has been unable to resolve or develop a repayment plan\nfor the two delinquent private loans. He pays his monthly expenses and does not incur\nany other debts as part of his daily living expenses. He is financially sound as related to\nhis current living expenses. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply only\nto allegations 1. a and 1.b of the SOR.9\nApplicant denies that he had an account with a cell phone carrier. Only one of the\nthree credit reports of record indicates that Applicant owed money to the creditor listed\nin allegation 1.e of the SOR. Given Applicant\u2019s denial, I find that the evidence of record\nis insufficient to establish this debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\nIn today\u2019s society, many college students are incurring significant educational debt as a way to finance a\n10\ncollege education, whether it is a private or a public institution. The issue of excessive educational debt and\nrepayment will most likely come up again. \n7\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant financial problems are the\nresult of inappropriate advice given to him by his parents about paying for his college\neducation. As a result, he has accumulated more than $150,000 in private and federal\neducational loans. One-half of these loans are currently in forbearance. The remaining\nare in default. Applicant has enrolled in and complied with a rehabilitation payment plan\nfor the two federal education loans which are in default. He has also paid a small private\neducation loan. He continued these payments even after he lost his job, a\ncommendable decision on his part and an indication of his intent to pay his school\nloans. He plans to consolidate all his federal loans into one once he has rehabilitated\nthe two loans in default. He expects this to occur sometime in the early spring. He has\nnot resolved the issues related to his two private education loans totaling $65,000, in\npart because his income does not allow him to pay the requested $1,500 a month\npayment. At this time, he is not actively working with this creditor on this problem.\nApplicant has made progress in resolving his educational loan defaults, but has not\nresolved all the issues raised regarding his educational debts. He has not yet\nestablished a solid track record for paying all his education loans. Since he is still trying\nto resolve some significant debt and needs to show he is committed to paying his\neducation loans, I find he has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about\nhis finances. Accordingly, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his financial considerations.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 37 years old, earned a Master\u2019s degree in computer science, and expects to receive a second Master\u2019s degree in business administration this year (Tr. 5). Applicant has worked in information technology since the late 1990s, and for federal contractors since 2002 (GE 2). He is currently a principal with a defense contractor (Tr. 56). Applicant was born in Macedonia, which formerly was part of Yugoslavia (Tr. 39). He came to the United States in 1996, at the age of 24, to earn a graduate degree in computer science. He held a student visa until 1998, at which time he received an H1-B visa (GE 1). Applicant\u2019s wife, a dual citizen of the United States and Macedonia, is employed by a federal agency. They married in 1999 and have a 16-month-old daughter. 2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which he signed on November 8, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nMay 20, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \n \nOn December 18, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), which specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant received the SOR on December 22, \n2008. He signed his notarized Answer on January 7, 2009, in which he admitted to all \nthe allegations in the Statement of Reasons, except allegation 1.c. He also requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 24, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on February 26, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nthe following day, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 16, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, which were marked \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, and admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and also presented the testimony of one witness. He offered one exhibit, \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A, which also was admitted without objection. I held the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. Department Counsel \nforwarded without objection Applicant\u2019s timely submission of two additional documents. I \nadmitted the additional documents as AE B and C. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 20, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 37 years old, earned a Master\u2019s degree in computer science, and \nexpects to receive a second Master\u2019s degree in business administration this year (Tr. 5). \nApplicant has worked in information technology since the late 1990s, and for federal \ncontractors since 2002 (GE 2). He is currently a principal with a defense contractor (Tr. \n56).  \n \nApplicant was born in Macedonia, which formerly was part of Yugoslavia (Tr. 39). \nHe came to the United States in 1996, at the age of 24, to earn a graduate degree in \ncomputer science. He held a student visa until 1998, at which time he received an H1-B \nvisa (GE 1). Applicant\u2019s wife, a dual citizen of the United States and Macedonia, is \nemployed by a federal agency. They married in 1999 and have a 16-month-old daughter. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\nHe has not sought Macedonian citizenship for his daughter (Tr. 27). Applicant became a \nU.S. citizen in February 2007, and received his U.S. passport in April of the same year \n(GE 2).  \n \n \nIn June 2002, before becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant obtained a Macedonian \npassport, which is valid until 2012 (GE 4). After becoming a U.S. citizen, he traveled to \nMacedonia in May 2007, using his Macedonian passport. He has traveled several \ntimes since becoming a U.S. citizen. For instance, he traveled to China as part of his \ngraduate school program (Tr. 37). On all these trips--Bulgaria in 2007, and China, \nHong Kong, and Macedonia in 2008--he used his U.S passport (AE B; Tr. 24; 36-37).  \n \n \nUntil recently, Applicant did not realize that his foreign passport would present a \nproblem for his security clearance, and only learned that it would when he received the \nSOR (Tr. 20), and subsequently spoke with Department Counsel about the hearing. \nApplicant was not aware of the requirement to destroy or surrender his foreign \npassport. \u201cI have never received any help from the Security Office of the \ncompany\u2026.And it has come to my attention that it is possible to actually surrender the \npassport, and I actually would like to get some guideline [sic] on this, whether this is \ntrue or not.\u201d (Tr. 17-18). Following the hearing, Applicant submitted a notarized letter \nsigned by his employer\u2019s Facility Security Officer, attesting that Applicant had \nsurrendered his foreign passport. If Applicant requests return of the passport while he \nholds a security clearance, DOHA will be informed by his employer (AE C). \n \nApplicant does not remember saying during his security interview that he \nintended to vote in Macedonian elections (SOR allegation 1.c.; Tr. 19). He did not vote \nin the Macedonian parliamentary elections in 2008, which occurred after he became a \nU.S. citizen, and has no intention to vote in upcoming elections (Answer; Tr. 19-20). He \ndid visit the Macedonian embassy at times in the past. His last visit occurred in October \n2005, before he became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 20). \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother and in-laws are citizens of Macedonia and live \nthere. He keeps in touch with his parents about once or twice per month, by phone or \nemail, and with his brother less often, approximately once per month. He speaks with \nhis in-laws every month or two. When he visits Macedonia, he stays with his mother \nand visits his own and his wife\u2019s family. His parents are in their 60\u2019s. Approximately 20 \nyears ago, his mother was employed as a judge in a district court (GE 4), but she is \nnow in private law practice. His father is a professor. Applicant identified the university \nthat employs him as an educational institution affiliated with the government (GE 4). \nApplicant's father performed mandatory service in the Yugoslavian military in the 1970s \nfor approximately one year. Applicant's brother did not serve in the military. Applicant is \nnot aware that any of his family, or his wife\u2019s family, have had involvement with the \nMacedonian authorities, or have been involved in political activism. He does not \nprovide financial support to any family members or in-laws in Macedonia. His mother-\nin-law is a kindergarten teacher in a public school and his father-in-law is a bank clerk. \n(GE 4; Tr. 30; 38-42). \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \n \nApplicant's friend, a U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, testified. He has served in the \nmilitary for 26 years, and has held a security clearance since 1978, including Top Secret \nsince 1995. He has known Applicant for five years. The witness volunteered to appear \non Applicant's behalf. He testified that Applicant came to the United States to better \nhimself (Tr. 46). The witness was present when Applicant was sworn in as a U.S. \ncitizen, and they talked about what it means to be an American. The witness met \nApplicant's mother and in-laws when Applicant's daughter was born. He testified that \nApplicant has built his life in the United States, with his wife and daughter, and he wants \nhis daughter to grow up to be an American. Applicant has worked on federal contracts \nfor years and is highly trustworthy, stable and reliable (Tr. 44-52).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest4 for an Applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \nApplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, Applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \nApplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target \nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition7 in this case is AG \u00b6 7(b): \n \nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, a sibling, and his in-laws live in Macedonia. He has an \nongoing relationship, keeping in touch with his parents twice per month and his brother \nabout once per month. He visits the country to see his family, and he stays with his \nmother during these visits. When his first child was born, his relatives visited and \nstayed with him in the United States. These foreign ties pose a potential conflict of \ninterest, and AG \u00b6 7(b) applies.  \nThe foreign influence guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Under AG \u00b6 8, the following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n7 Department Counsel stated that heightened risk is not a concern, given the country under \nconsideration in this case (Tr. 62). Therefore, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (d) and (e) are not at \nissue. \n\n \n \n6\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. \n \nBased on the nature of the country involved, it is unlikely that Applicant would be \nplaced in a position that would force him to choose between the interests of the United \nStates and those of his foreign relatives. Macedonia is in the process of applying for \nNATO membership. It is an ally of the United States. Department Counsel noted that \nthe two countries have a \u201cvery close friendly relationship\u201d and that Macedonia does not \npose a high risk (Tr. 62; 65-66). Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) applies.   \n \n \nApplicant's ties to the United States also weigh in his favor when evaluating the \nquestion of potential conflicts of interest. Applicant came to the United States to further \nhis education, and for a better life. He worked toward and succeeded in his goal by \nearning one Master\u2019s degree, and soon, a second one. He has been employed here for \n12 years, and has contributed to federal projects since 2002. His wife also works for \nthe U.S. government. He has been a homeowner in the United States since 2003. His \nchild was born here, and it is noteworthy that he has not sought foreign citizenship for \nher. Applicant has established strong ties to the United States. I conclude that he \nwould choose these ties over his foreign connections, in the unlikely event that a \nconflict of interest arose. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. I find for Applicant on Guideline B. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern involving foreign preference arises  \n \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference \nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be \nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to \nthe interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9) \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10, the following disqualifying condition is relevant: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  \nThis includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport;\u2026 \n(7) voting in a foreign election\u2026 \n\n \n \n7\n \nApplicant acquired a Macedonian passport in 2002, before he became a U.S. citizen, \nand it remains valid until 2012. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) applies. Applicant used his foreign \npassport one time to enter and exit Macedonia after attaining U.S. citizenship. \nApplicant credibly testified that he was not advised by any security official that this act \nhad implications for his security clearance. He has traveled to foreign countries several \ntimes since 2007, including Macedonia, but has used only his U.S. passport.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intended to vote in future foreign elections.  \nimplicating AG \u00b6 10(a)(7). However, this disqualifying condition requires that an \nApplicant has exercised a right of foreign citizenship by actually voting. Applicant has \nnot voted in a Macedonian election since becoming a U.S. citizen, including one that \noccurred recently in 2008. He has no intent to do so in the future. AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) does \nnot apply. \n \nThe following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11 is relevant: \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nInitially, Applicant was unaware that his valid foreign passport represented a security \nconcern. After speaking with Department Counsel, he learned how to meet the \nrequirement to surrender or destroy it. Within hours of the end of the hearing, Applicant \nsurrendered his foreign passport to his Facility Security Officer, and had a notarized \nconfirmation forwarded to DOHA. If he requests return of the passport, DOHA will be \ninformed. AG \u00b6 11(e) applies. I find for Applicant on Guideline C. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n \n8\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant has an ongoing relationship with immediate family members in a \nforeign country. They are in fairly frequent contact, and he has traveled to Macedonia \nseveral times since 2004. However, given the nature of the country involved, and \nApplicant's significant ties to the United States, he would resolve any unlikely conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. Applicant held a valid foreign passport after he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. He was never put on notice that it represented a security \nproblem, and he used it one time without realizing that it would raise such issues. \nApplicant surrendered his passport to his FSO, and supplied evidence that it is in the \ncontrol of his employer\u2019s security department. DOHA will be informed if Applicant \nrequests the passport, eliminating the possibility that Applicant could use the passport \nwhile he holds a security clearance.   \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.e. \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.h. \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

She states that, pursuant to her\n4\nagreement with the agency, she puts aside $405 a month into a savings account, the value of which at the time of the\nhearing was $3,300.

Finding error, we remand the case back to the Judge\n2\nfor issuance of a new decision.3\nThe Judge made unchallenged findings that Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense\ncontractor.  She has three delinquent debts which total in excess of $31,000. The largest delinquent\ndebt is $29,630 owed on a vehicle.

Department Counsel is correct that Applicant\u2019s mere intention to file for\nbankruptcy is not entitled to much weight.  A promise to take remedial steps in the future does not\nconstitute evidence of demonstrated reform and rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0544 at\n5 (App. Bd. May 12, 1997)(promise to take remedial action in future, however credible and sincere,\nnot evidence of actual rehabilitation).  Furthermore, Department Counsel notes the Judge did not\n\n3\ndiscuss the significance of the timing of Applicant\u2019s motion toward filing bankruptcy.  (Nor did the\nJudge discuss the significance of the timing of her credit counseling or payment of debts).\nIt is well settled that an administrative judge has broad discretion in writing a security\nclearance decision.  However, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the\nparties and the Board to discern the findings the Judge is making and what conclusions the Judge\nis reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-05665 at 4 (App. Bd. May 7, 2003).

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 26, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on March 7, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on April 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 21,\n2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 26, 2009. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non her own behalf, and she submitted Exhibit A, which was entered into evidence\nwithout objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on June 4, 2009.  \n\n2\nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 9, 2009, to\nsubmit additional matters.  She timely submitted additional documents, that have been\nentered into evidence without objection as Exhibits B through M, and the record closed\non that date. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. She is not married, and she has two children. She is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists nine allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.i., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $625.\nApplicant testified she was not aware of the origin of this debt, but it has not been paid. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she was considering filing bankruptcy and\nhad a meeting scheduled to meet with an attorney in that regard. In her post hearing\nexhibits, Applicant also has consulted with a second credit counseling service (CCS),\nafter she had also consulted with a previous CCS, which had taken no positive steps to\nresolve her debts (Tr at 40-45). Applicant stated that this debt will be included in the\nbankruptcy that she plans to file (Exhibit B). She also included a letter from a law firm,\ndated June 2, 2009, (Exhibit C), which confirmed that they would be representing\nApplicant \u201cwith regard to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.\u201d \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $29,630.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a vehicle, which Applicant still possessed at the time\nof the hearing, had not yet been paid. In Exhibit B, Applicant indicated that she would\ninclude this debt in her bankruptcy.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 for a judgement is cited in the SOR in the\namount of $822. During the hearing, Department Counsel stated that based upon an\nindication, as reported in Exhibit 2, that the Judgement had been satisfied, the\nGovernment would stipulate that this debt had been resolved (Tr at 25-27). \n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $50.\nApplicant testified that she has paid this debt. Exhibit D establishes that Applicant paid\n$71.07 to a collection agency for this debt, and it has been paid in full.\n1.e. This second overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$50 for a medical bill. Applicant testified that she has paid this debt. Exhibit E\nestablishes that Applicant paid $69.01 to the same collection agency for this debt, which\nhas the same original creditor and may actually be the same debt, but in any event, it\nhas been paid in full.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,027.\nApplicant testified that she has not paid this debt, but she is disputing it since she\nbelieves it may have been based on identity theft, which Applicant contends she\nsuffered (Tr at 48-50). Exhibit 3 establishes that Applicant did dispute this bill with the\ncredit reporting agency, which began an investigation to determine if the debt was\ncorrect and owing. However, no evidence was offered to ascertain the result of the\ninvestigation.  In Exhibit B, Applicant indicated that she would include this debt in her\nbankruptcy.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,452.\nApplicant testified that she only owed the co-payment requirement of $50 for this debt\nfor a medical bill, which she has paid. She averred that the rest of the bill should have\nbeen paid by her medical insurance carrier. Exhibit G, a letter from the collection\nagency for this debt, establishes that this debt was resolved. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $203.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a medical bill, should also have been paid by her\ninsurance carrier at the time. Exhibit H, a letter from the Applicant\u2019s insurance carrier,\nseems to establish that this debt was resolved. \n1.i. This second overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$2,460. Applicant testified that this debt for a medical bill from the same health care\nprovider as 1.h., above, should also have been paid by her insurance carrier. Exhibit H,\na letter from the Applicant\u2019s insurance carrier, also seems to establish that this debt was\nresolved. \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a.  Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July\n10, 2007 (Exhibit 1). Section 27:d. asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any\njudgments against you that have not been paid?\"; to which she answered \"No.\" In the\nSOR, the Government alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to list that he had an\nunpaid judgment filed against her within the last seven years, as set forth in\nsubparagraph 1.c., above. \nAs reviewed in 1.c., above, based on Exhibit 2 it has been established that this\njudgement had been resolved, and it was done prior to her completing Exhibit 1.\n\n4\nTherefore, I find that Applicant was correct in responding \u201cNo\u201d to this question.  After\nreviewing the allegation and additional evidence at the hearing, Department Counsel\nindicated that the Government would withdraw this allegation. \n2.b.\nApplicant responded \"No\" to Section 28:a., which asks, \u201cIn the last 7\nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d She also failed to list\nany debts. The SOR alleges that Applicant should have answered yes and included the\ndebts listed as 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.g., as alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant testified that at the time she completed the SCA. she had not reviewed\na credit report, so she was not aware that she had any overdue debts. Applicant further\nexplained that she had a continuing, contentious relationship with a man, and she lived\nwith him on three separate occasions, and then she moved out of their joint living\nquarters three times, ultimately completely ending the relationship in 2007. She\nspeculated that she was unaware of her debts, because this individual with whom she\nlived, may not have been giving her mail to her. She reiterated credibly that if she had\nbeen aware of the overdue debts she would have included them in her SCA (Tr at 70-\n71). She only became aware of these debts after meeting with a Government\ninvestigator in March 2008. I find Applicant credible that she did not intend to mislead\nthe Government in her response to Question 28: a.\n2.c. Applicant responded \"No\" to Section 28:b., which asks, \u201cAre you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\" She also failed to list any debts. The SOR\nalleges that Applicant should have answered yes and included the debts listed as 1.a.,\n1.b., 1.d. through 1.g., as alleged in the SOR.\nIn response to this allegation, Applicant reiterated that at the time she completed\nthe SCA. she was not aware that she had any overdue debts. I also find Applicant\ncredible that she did not intend to mislead the Government in her response to Question\n28:b.\nApplicant testified that one of the causes of her financial problems was that her\nroommate moved out of an apartment, for which both of them were paying rent.\nUltimately, she was unable to pay for the rent herself, together with the payments for the\ntruck she had purchased, which resulted in the debt that is reviewed in 1.b., above. The\ncontinuing on again, off again relationship with her boyfriend, which has been described\nabove, also contributed to her financial difficulties, since he ejected her from the home\nwhere they were both living, and she thereafter was forced to live for a period of time in\na hotel. She had also taken out a loan with this man, and she believed the payments\nwere being made out of the proceeds of the loan, which, she later learned, was not\ncorrect.  \nApplicant submitted a report (Exhibit M), showing her current monthly expenses\nwere $4,533. Unfortunately, she did not include her monthly income in this report, so it\nis not particularly helpful in giving full insight into her current economic condition. She\ndid testify that outside of the debts reviewed above, she is current on her most recent\nbills. \n\n5\nApplicant also submitted four character letters from individuals who have known\nApplicant in an employment capacity (Exhibits A, I, K, and L), Exhibit J is a duplicate of\nExhibit A. The letters were all very positive, describing Applicant as \u201cintelligent,\nenthusiastic and motivated . . . who conscientiously adheres to company standards and\nguidelines.\u201d  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts. Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under\nGuideline F, I conclude both DC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s history of\nnot meeting financial obligations and her previous inability or unwillingness to satisfy her\ndebts. \nHowever, I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) (d) applies as Applicant, who has\nengaged the services of two separate CCS companies, paid several off her debts,\npursued disputing the debts which she believed were not hers, and met with an attorney\nto file for bankruptcy to resolve her other debts, has initiated a good-faith effort to repay\nthe overdue creditors or in other ways resolve her debts. I have also considered that\nshe is not overdue on any of her current debts. I, therefore, find Guideline F for\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that Applicant did not provide incorrect material\ninformation to the Government on the SCA that she executed on July 10, 2007,\nregarding Question 27 d. Since Applicant had paid the judgement before competing the\nSCA, the correct response to that question was no, which was the answer Applicant\nprovided. \nI also find that Applicant testified credibly that she did not knowingly provide\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA regarding Questions 28.a.\nor 28.b. Applicant testified to specific, credible reasons she was unaware of her debts,\nand that she did not deliberately provide incorrect information the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant. I therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including the four character letters and her\nsignificant attempt to resolve her overdue debts, I find that the record evidence leaves\nme with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.: For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 24, 2010\n______________\nDecision On Remand \n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on March 7, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on April 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 21,\n2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 26, 2009. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non her own behalf, and she submitted Exhibit A, which was entered into evidence\nwithout objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on June 4, 2009.  \n\n2\nI granted Applicant's request to keep the record open until June 9, 2009, to\nsubmit additional matters.  She timely submitted additional documents, that have been\nentered into evidence without objection as Exhibits B through M, and the record closed\non that date. I issued my written decision on August 26, 2009, and based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation was granted. \nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal and the Appeal Board (AB) issued its\ndecision on November 24, 2009, which concluded that the case be Remanded. The AB\nheld that there was not enough discussion in the decision regarding my consideration of\nApplicant\u2019s meeting with an attorney with the intention to file bankruptcy. \nOn May 12, 2010, I issued an Order On Remand, in which I reopened \u201cthe record\nto allow Applicant to submit any available documentation showing the status of the\nbankruptcy, if any, filed by Applicant, and the status of any other debts listed on the\nSOR, which had not been resolved at the time of the hearing on August 26, 2009.\u201d\nApplicant submitted two documents, which have been marked as Exhibits N and O, and\nentered into evidence without objection. The Finding of Facts regarding Exhibits N and\nO, and their effect on this remand decision will be discussed below. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. She is not married, and she has two children. She is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense sector. \nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR lists nine allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.i., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR: \n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $625.\nApplicant testified she was not aware of the origin of this debt, but it has not been paid. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she was considering filing bankruptcy and\nhad a meeting scheduled to meet with an attorney in that regard. In her post hearing\nexhibits, Applicant also has consulted with a second credit counseling service (CCS),\nafter she had also consulted with a previous CCS, which had taken no positive steps to\nresolve her debts. (Tr at 40-45.) Applicant stated that this debt will be included in the\nbankruptcy that she plans to file. (Exhibit B.) She also included a letter from a law firm,\n\n3\ndated June 2, 2009, (Exhibit C), which confirmed that they would be representing\nApplicant \"with regard to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.\" \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $29,630.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a vehicle, which Applicant still possessed at the time\nof the hearing, had not yet been paid. In Exhibit B, Applicant indicated that she would\ninclude this debt in her bankruptcy. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 for a judgement is cited in the SOR in the\namount of $822. During the hearing, Department Counsel stated that based upon an\nindication, as reported in Exhibit 2, that the Judgement had been satisfied, the\nGovernment would stipulate that this debt had been resolved. (Tr at 25-27.) \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $50.\nApplicant testified that she has paid this debt. Exhibit D establishes that Applicant paid\n$71.07 to a collection agency for this debt, and it has been paid in full. \n1.e. This second overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$50 for a medical bill. Applicant testified that she has paid this debt. Exhibit E\nestablishes that Applicant paid $69.01 to the same collection agency for this debt, which\nhas the same original creditor and may actually be the same debt, but in any event, it\nhas been paid in full. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,027.\nApplicant testified that she has not paid this debt, but she is disputing it since she\nbelieves it may have been based on identity theft, which Applicant contends she\nsuffered. (Tr at 48-50.) Exhibit 3 establishes that Applicant did dispute this bill with the\ncredit reporting agency, which began an investigation to determine if the debt was\ncorrect and owing. However, no evidence was offered to ascertain the result of the\ninvestigation.  In Exhibit B, Applicant indicated that she would include this debt in her\nbankruptcy. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,452.\nApplicant testified that she only owed the co-payment requirement of $50 for this debt\nfor a medical bill, which she has paid. She averred that the rest of the bill should have\nbeen paid by her medical insurance carrier. Exhibit G, a letter from the collection\nagency for this debt, establishes that this debt was resolved. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $203.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a medical bill should also have been paid by her\ninsurance carrier at the time. Exhibit H, a letter from the Applicant's insurance carrier,\nseems to establish that this debt was resolved. \n1.i. This second overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$2,460. Applicant testified that this debt for a medical bill, from the same health care\nprovider as 1.h., above, should also have been paid by her insurance carrier. Exhibit H,\n\n4\na letter from the Applicant's insurance carrier, also seems to establish that this debt was\nresolved. \nApplicant testified that one of the causes of her financial problems was that her\nroommate moved out of an apartment, for which both of them were paying rent.\nUltimately, she was unable to pay for the rent herself, together with the payments for the\ntruck she had purchased, which resulted in the debt that is reviewed in 1.b., above. The\ncontinuing on again, off again relationship with her boyfriend, which has been described\nabove, also contributed to her financial difficulties, since he ejected her from the home\nwhere they were both living, and she thereafter was forced to live for a period of time in\na hotel. She had also taken out a loan with this man, and she believed the payments\nwere being made out of the proceeds of the loan, which, she later learned, was not\ncorrect. \nApplicant submitted a report (Exhibit M), showing her current monthly expenses\nwere $4,533. Unfortunately, she did not include her monthly income in this report, so it\nis not particularly helpful in giving full insight into her current economic condition. She\ndid testify that outside of the debts reviewed above, she is current on her most recent\nbills. \nApplicant also submitted four character letters from individuals who have known\nApplicant in an employment capacity (Exhibits A, I, K, and L), Exhibit J is a duplicate of\nExhibit A. The letters were all very positive, describing Applicant as \"intelligent,\nenthusiastic and motivated . . . who conscientiously adheres to company standards and\nguidelines.\"  \nFindings of Fact Regarding Exhibits N and O\nExhibit N consists of a one page, undated, unsigned letter from Applicant, in\nwhich she refers to nine exhibits that she states will be part of her Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. No exhibits were included or submitted with the letter. Exhibit N is identical\nto the first page of a two page letter, dated June 5, 2009, that Applicant submitted post\nhearing, which was marked as Exhibit B, The only difference is that on the recent letter,\nApplicant simply removed the date and submitted only one page of the letter.   \nExhibit O is a one page letter, dated May 25, 2010, from the legal administrator\nof a law firm that has been engaged by Applicant to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The\nadministrator states the law firm anticipates a \u201ctimely filing pending receipt of\n[Applicant\u2019s] credit counseling Certificate of Completion mandated by The Court.\u201d  I\nhave reviewed Exhibit N in comparison to Exhibit C, a letter from this same law firm,\ndated June 2, 2009, where they confirm they \u201crepresent [Applicant] with regard to\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy filing.\u201d Exhibit O is literally 51 weeks after Exhibit C, and more\nthan one year after the hearing, and yet it appears Applicant is currently no closer to\nresolving her overdue debts in bankruptcy than she was one year ago. Therefore, I do\nnot find that Applicant has acted responsibly to attempt to resolve her remaining\ndelinquent debts in an expeditious manner. \n\n5\nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: I initially found find that AG \u00b6  20(d) was applicable because Applicant had\nengaged the services of two separate CCS companies, paid several of her debts,\npursued disputing the debts which she believed were not hers, and met with an attorney\nto file for bankruptcy to resolve her other debts, and therefore, she had \u201cinitiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  However, it is now\nmore than one year post hearing, and Applicant is no closer to resolving those overdue\ndebts that she indicated she planned to discharge in bankruptcy than she was at the\nhearing. Therefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial\nconcerns of the Government. I, therefore, find Guideline F against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve her overdue debts in bankruptcy more than one\nyear after the hearing, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.f.: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g. through 1.i.: For Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.: \n For Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case on\nremand, it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for\na security clearance.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 5 June 2009 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nH, Drug Involvement and E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 30 June\n1\n2009, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 September 2009, and\nI convened a hearing 22 September 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 30\nSeptember 2009.\nMay 26, 2010\n\nHowever, while Applicant admitted using marijuana (SOR 1.a) she specified that she did not use marijuana\n2\nafter 2000. And while she also admitted (SOR 2.b) that she did not disclose an agency denial of special\naccess in June 2005 on her July 2007 clearance application, she asserted the affirmative defense that she\nwas not aware of the denial until her subject interview in November 2007 (Answer, GE 4)\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.d and 2.a.  She is a\n2\n37-year-old sales manager employed by a defense contractor since May 2007. She\ndoes not currently hold a clearance, but appears to have held one 2001\u2013June 2005.\nApplicant first applied for a clearance in about June 1999 (GE 6). Her initial\nclearance application is not in the record, but she was interviewed by a government\ninvestigator in August 1999. During the interview, which was reduced to a sworn\nstatement (GE 3), she disclosed that she had used marijuana, LSD, and cocaine during\nher college years and for about a year thereafter. The sworn statement supports a\nreasonable inference that she reported her drug abuse on the clearance application,\nbecause she amended her estimate of marijuana use.\nApplicant used marijuana once or twice per month between 1989 and June 1994.\nShe estimates she used it 50-55 times during that 4-5 years, in social settings (concerts,\nparties) with classmates and roommates. She never purchased marijuana, although she\ncontributed $5-10 to the purchase once or twice while in college. She did not use\nmarijuana while she was home during summer breaks. \nApplicant used LSD eight times between fall 1989 and spring 1993. The LSD was\nprovided by college friends. She recalls using LSD in October 1989 at a rock concert,\nMarch 1990 at a rock concert, and late-summer 1990 at a fraternity party. She used\noccasionally at rock concerts the last few times she used it, the last time in March 1993.\nApplicant used cocaine six times between December 1992 and April 1993 at\nparties with her boyfriend, who was a cocaine user and provided her the drug. She\nended the relationship with this boyfriend because she realized that it was not the kind\nof lifestyle she wanted.\nApplicant foreswore any future drug use during her August 1999 interview,\nstating that it was inconsistent with her personal and professional goals. Nevertheless,\nshe later reported using marijuana twice between 1994 and January 2000. During an\ninterview conducted by unsworn declaration in November 2007 (GE 4), she recalled\nusing marijuana once after 1994 at a party, and once at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in\nDecember 1999. On both occasions, she took a puff on a marijuana cigarette as it was\npassed around the group. Her ex-husband, a marijuana user, was one of the group. At\nthe time, Applicant did not think about the potential consequences of her marijuana use,\nbut later regretted the use, and no longer associates with any of the people she used to\nparty with.\n\nThe government did not allege this omission as a falsification in the SOR.\n3\nGE 5 is the intra-agency decision document. It is not addressed to Applicant and does not contain the\n4\nexaminer\u2019s notes or any of the materials generated during the polygraph examination.\n3\nAs a result of the June 1999 background investigation that closed in July 2001,\nApplicant obtained her clearance from DOHA in April 2002 (GE 6). She apparently held\nthis clearance without incident until June 2004, when she changed employers. Her new\nemployer required a different level of access, and while her June 1999 investigation was\nadequate for her interim clearance, the special access she needed required her to\ncomplete a new clearance application in June 2004 (GE 2) and undergo a polygraph\nexamination by the government agency supported by her employer. GE 2 did not reflect\nany drug use by Applicant within the last seven years.  She testified credibly (Tr. 53-54)\n3\nthat she relied on the advice of friends who had clearances in denying any drug use, but\nlater realized that choice was \u201cstupid.\u201d\nThe polygraph examination was conducted in November 2004. The areas of\ninquiry were her failure to disclose any drug use on her June 2004 clearance\napplication, and discussion of her drug use since 1994.\nApplicant has consistently stated (GE 4, Answer, Tr. 30) that she has not used\nmarijuana since the night in December 1999. She testified credibly that she told the\nexaminer this during the polygraph. However, she was nervous because she knew she\nhad falsified her clearance application, and during further questioning by the examiner\nshe disclosed that she had continued to associate with her ex-husband and attend\nsocial events where marijuana was used, until May 2004. She did not believe there\nwere any unresolved issues when the examination was over.\nIn April 2005, the contract Applicant was working on expired, and she went to\nwork for a different company, one that did not require her to have a clearance (GE 1). In\nMarch 2005, the government agency\u2019s security division issued its clearance decision,\ndenying Applicant\u2019s request for special access (GE 5).  According to GE 6, the\n4\ngovernment agency issued a denial letter in June 2005 that was received by DOHA\nlater that month. In July 2005, DOHA terminated Applicant\u2019s clearances because of loss\nof jurisdiction. The entry noted that Applicant had terminated employment, and the\nadjudicative issue had not been resolved.\nWhen Applicant completed her clearance application for her current job in July\n2007 (GE 1), she said she had not used drugs in the last seven years (\u00a724) and had\nnever had a clearance denied or revoked (\u00a726). The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s\nanswers were deliberately false, based on her purported disclosures recorded in GE 5,\nthat she continued to use marijuana sporadically until May 2004. Applicant denies\nfalsifying her application, credibly asserting that her last drug use was more than seven\nyears ago, and that she never received any notification of the denial of her request for\nspecial access in June 2005. Nothing in GE 5 or 6 establishes that Applicant received\nnotice of the agency decision. Indeed, reasonable inferences from GE 5 and 6 support\n\nGE 6 provides additional support for this conclusion. DOHA records the agency denial of special access in\n5\nApril 2005, reported by the mid-June 2005 denial letter. However, DOHA also records loss of jurisdiction\n(which would occur when Applicant terminated employment) in July 2005. Allowing for reasonable\nadministrative delay by the employer, Applicant\u2019s departure from the job in June 2005 may be inferred to have\nnot been reported until July 2005. In addition, DOHA did not reestablish jurisdiction until July 2007, when\nApplicant submitted her most recent clearance application. Applicant\u2019s interim clearance was denied by DOHA\nin August 2007 based on the 2005 agency action, but an October 2007 entry that may be internally\ninconsistent (and may be a data entry error) reports a final agency appeal decision dated mid-June 2007 (vice\n2005) based on Applicant choosing to not appeal the 2005 denial decision. As there is no evidence Applicant\never got notice of that decision, this may reflect nothing more than that the time for appeal expired without\ncommunication from Applicant\u2014which would be consistent with her not receiving notice of the original\ndecision.\n4\nher contention that she did not receive notice of the agency decision. The agency\ndecision document was dated late March 2005. The letter to DOHA was dated mid-June\n2005, not received by DOHA until late-June 2005, and not entered into the clearance\ndatabase until July 2007. It unlikely that any denial letter sent to Applicant or her\nemployer was dated any earlier than mid-June 2005. Neither GE 5 nor 6 establish that\nthe denial letter was sent to Applicant or her employer, and any letter sent to her\nemployer would have been received after she left employment there, and moved to a\nposition where she did not require a clearance.5\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be considered in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence\nof a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence\nas a whole, the relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).\n.\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does, it establishes a baseline case against access to\nclassified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\n7\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n8\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n9\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence;\n5\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s sporadic marijuana use between 1989 and December 1999.7\nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. The issue in this case boils down to\nwhich is a more credible statement of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse history: her multiple\nstatements [sworn in August 1999 (GE 3), in her June 2009 Answer, and at hearing (Tr.\n30); unsworn in November 2007 (GE 4)] or her purported statements made during a\nNovember 2004 polygraph examination (GE 5). Either she last used marijuana in\nDecember 1999, or she continued to use it until May 2004. I find her statements that\nshe last used marijuana in December 1999 more credible. She has consistently stated\nsince her interview in November 2007 that her last marijuana use was in December\n1999. Those statements have now been subject to cross-examination at hearing, during\nwhich I found her testimony credible. Her purported statements during her November\n2004 polygraph examination were recorded by the agency adjudicator, one step\nremoved from the examination and its supporting documentation. Further, neither the\npolygraph examiner nor the adjudicator have been cross-examined, and Applicant did\nnot have the opportunity to challenge the agency decision or the adjudicator\u2019s or\nexaminer\u2019s documentation. Finally, Applicant\u2019s statement that she reported being in the\ncompany of marijuana users and use until May 2004 provides a reasonable and\nplausible explanation for the contents of GE 5.\nHaving accepted Applicant\u2019s statements of her last marijuana use, I find use\nmitigated by the age and infrequency of her marijuana use, the unlikelihood that the\ncircumstances of her marijuana use will recur, and the fact that her use approximately\n10 years ago does not cast doubt on her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  She\n8\nhas demonstrated intent to not abuse drugs in the future by her abstinence, her change\nin associates, and her change of social environments.  Applicant is unlikely to use drugs\n9\nin the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\n\n6\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nApplicant denied using any illegal drugs after New Year\u2019s Eve 1999 [and thus more than\nthe seven years called for on the July 2007 clearance application (GE 1)], and denied\nany knowledge of the denial of her request for special access (thus truthfully stating that\nto her knowledge she had never had a clearance or access denied or revoked). The\ngovernment had the burden to establish that Applicant used marijuana after December\n1999 and was aware of the agency decision on her request for special access in June\n2005. Applicant credibly denied receiving any notice of the agency decision, and not\nonly do the government exhibits fail to prove otherwise, they tend to confirm her\nstatements. GE 5 is not addressed to Applicant, and while GE 6 indicates the existence\nof a June 2005 denial letter, the government has not produced that letter, so its contents\nand addressees (aside from DOHA) are unknown. GE 1 reflects, and GE 6, tends to\ncorroborate, that Applicant first applied for a clearance in about June 1999. Her August\n1999 sworn statement (GE 3) shows that she was investigated, that she  disclosed her\ndrug use on her clearance application, and thoroughly discussed her drug use. GE 6\nshows the completion of her initial background investigation, and subsequent clearance.\nGE 1 and 2 show that she moved to a different job in June 2004, that required a\npolygraph examination, and GE 5 confirms Applicant\u2019s claim that the polygraph\noccurred. However, GE 1 shows, and GE 6 confirms, that Applicant left that job in about\nApril 2005, before the results of GE 5 were sent to DOHA in June 2005. GE 6 confirms\nthat DOHA lost jurisdiction over Applicant\u2019s clearance when she terminated the\nemployment that required the clearance. That July 2005 entry reflects that the security\nissue was not resolved, and neither GE 5 nor 6 establish that Applicant was advised of\nthe agency\u2019s denial of her request for special access. GE 6 also shows that DOHA did\nnot reestablish jurisdiction over Applicant\u2019s clearance until her July 2007 application. GE\n4, Applicant\u2019s answer, and her testimony (Tr. 30) establish that she first learned of the\nagency decision to deny her request for special access during her interview in\nNovember 2007. Neither GE 5 nor 6 contain any evidence to contradict that claim.\nRegarding the extent and dates of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, she has\nconsistently and directly stated that her last use was December 1999. I found her\ntestimony on this issue credible. The contrary evidence in GE 5 I find unpersuasive for\nseveral reasons. First, GE 5 is the intra-agency decisional document, and reflects the\nauthor\u2019s conclusions about what the polygraph examiner recorded as Applicant\u2019s\ndisclosures. The supporting notes and materials are not in the record. Second, the\nrecord suggests that not only was Applicant not aware of any access decision made\nbased on GE 5, she never had an opportunity to challenge the \u201cfact\u201d recorded by the\nexaminer or contest the denial decision. Assuming all good-faith by the examiner and\nthe absence of any motive to report Applicant\u2019s disclosures inaccurately, the fact\nremains that Applicant\u2019s suggestion that her admissions to attending social events when\nmarijuana was used as late as May 2004 were misinterpreted by the examiner as\nindicating continued drug use by Applicant is reasonable. And without any opportunity to\ncorrect or contest the examiner\u2019s records, I will not find GE 5 conclusive evidence of\ndrug use after December 1999 in the face of Applicant\u2019s consistent representations to\nthe contrary. Having found that Applicant\u2019s answers to \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 26 were truthful (as\nknown to her at the time regarding \u00a726), no case for disqualification because of\n\n7\nfalsification has been made. The allegation (SOR 2.c) that Applicant used marijuana in\nDecember 1999 after submitting a clearance application in June 1999 is insufficient\nstanding alone to establish poor judgment requiring denial of her clearance. I resolve\nGuideline E for Applicant. Nothing in the whole-person factors of AG &2(a) requires a\ndifferent result.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 17, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  Item 3. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \nDecember 18, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 16, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated August 30, 2008, was provided to him, and he \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant\u2019s submitted a response to the FORM dated \nOctober 22, 2008. The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge on \nNovember 14, 2008, and due to caseload considerations was reassigned to me on \nNovember 18, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.e., 1.g. \u2013 1.i., 1.l., 1.q., 1.t. \u2013 1.v., and stated he lacked sufficient information to \nadmit or deny \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.j. \u2013 1.k., 1.m. \u2013 1.p., 1.r. \u2013 1.s. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old electronics technician, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 1996. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in \nJanuary 1997. Applicant has been legally separated from his wife since September \n1996. He has a seven-year-old daughter by another woman. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance in conjunction with his employment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial problems and \nincluded the review of his June 2008 and January 2008 credit bureau reports.4  \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address his delinquent debts in a \nmeaningful way. Although he discussed various attempts to address a number of debts, \nhe failed to provide documentation regarding these efforts and any documented \nsuccess in resolving his debts. He did state that \u201c[n]one of this explanation is meant to \nbe an excuse for the failure to meet all of my financial obligations but I am now fully \ncommitted to putting my financial life back in order beginning with my student loan and \nmy income taxes.\u201d5 He spoke of living pay check to pay check and planned to look for a \n \n \n3  The DOHA transmittal letter is dated September 4, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on September 12, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n4 Items 4 and 5. \n \n5 Item 2. \n \n\n \n \n3\n                                           \nsecond job. His monthly take home pay reflected a total of $2,172, and total monthly \nbills of $2,384. This total did not reflect expenses for food, laundry, utilities, gasoline. \nThese additional items bring his monthly debts/living expenses to an amount exceeding \n$2,600.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \n6  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \n\n \n \n4\n                                                                                                                                            \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, and his SOR \nresponse.  \n \nDepartment Counsel noted in his FORM that despite Applicant\u2019s admission of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. of a judgment of $1,353 in favor or a credit card company, his June \n2008 credit bureau report lists this judgment as satisfied.8 He further noted that \nApplicant admitted to the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l. and 1.q., which are both identical. \nThis creditor in these two allegations is a bank and the debt is in the approximate \namount of $1,031. Applicant\u2019s January 2008 credit bureau report lists this account as \nhaving been opened in September 2000 and as having a DLA of November 2002.9 \n \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n \n8 Item 4. \n \n9 Item 5. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                                                                                                            \nExcept as noted above, the Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions or \nevidence presented all of the debts alleged in the SOR.  \n \nTogether, Applicant\u2019s 20 delinquent debts excluding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.q. total \napproximately $64,930. There is no documentary evidence of any payments or payment \narrangements made on these accounts.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to raise the \napplicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security \nclearance application, Applicant has continuously worked for his current employer since \n1996. He presented no documentary evidence to show paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I conclude the debts, except the satisfied debt and \nthe duplicate debts, discussed above, are still valid and delinquent debts, and that \nApplicant is responsible for them.  \n \n \n10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n \n6\nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has not carried his \nburden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s employment record working for a government contractor weighs in his \nfavor. There is no evidence of any security-related violations. Aside from his delinquent \ndebts (which is a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen. These factors \nshow some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt going back to at least 2002. As an applicant for a \nsecurity clearance, he was or should have been well aware of his financial \nresponsibilities, and that his failure to be financially responsible would raise security \nclearance concerns.  \n \nHe provided little or no documented effort to resolve his delinquent debts prior to \nor after receipt of the SOR. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.: \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. \u2013 1.p.: \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.: \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r \u2013 1.v.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 26 and married with three children. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admitted the factual allegations, but denied that his conduct showed poor self- control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. The Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in about 2005. He was out of school, had a growing family, was spending money on his wife and extended family, and was not making enough money at work to meet his expenses. The Applicant and his family live with his parents. His father had some medical problems in the recent past that required the Applicant to pay some of the household expenses. This also caused him additional financial difficulties. In November 2007 he started working for his present employer and began earning enough money to begin paying his overdue debts, which he has been doing.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJuly 6, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Standard Form 86 - Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions, on February 12, 2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On January 20, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F regarding the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 11, 2009, and requested a\nhearing.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 16, 2009.  The case\nwas assigned to a different Administrative Judge on March 17, 2009.  I received the\ncase assignment on April 6, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 6, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 28, 2009. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one additional witness,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, without objection.  The Applicant\nrequested time to present additional evidence and, on May 22, 2009, submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit I, also without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on May 13, 2009.  The record closed on May 22, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 26 and married with three children.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds.  The\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations, but denied that his conduct showed poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in about 2005.  He was out of school,\nhad a growing family, was spending money on his wife and extended family, and was\nnot making enough money at work to meet his expenses.  \nThe Applicant and his family live with his parents.  His father had some medical\nproblems in the recent past that required the Applicant to pay some of the household\nexpenses.  This also caused him additional financial difficulties.  In November 2007 he\nstarted working for his present employer and began earning enough money to begin\npaying his overdue debts, which he has been doing.  (Transcript at 32-34, 38-39, 47-48,\n67-68; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, and I at 5.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $9,643.43\nfor a credit card debt.  The original indebtedness was $5,746.00, with interest making\nup the total amount.  The Applicant began trying to resolve this debt in February 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  He made a payment arrangement with the successor in interest,\nand agreed to pay $4,862.79 to resolve the debt.  He paid this debt in full on May 5,\n2009.  (Transcript at 26-29; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G, and I at 2-3.)\nSubparagraph 1.b. The Applicant admits that he owes approximately $5,707.00\nfor a credit card bill.  The Applicant testified that he came to a payment agreement in\nFebruary 2009 with the law firm representing the creditor. The agreement was for the\nApplicant to pay $2,700.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, and F at 1.)  The Applicant testified,\n\u201cI was contacted by [the law firm\u2019s] office a few days later basically saying the offer was\nno longer valid.\u201d  (Transcript at 35; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E, and F at 2.)  The Applicant\n\n3\nprovided documentary evidence showing that he had the funds to pay this debt, and\nwas prepared to pay this debt.  (Transcript at 44-46; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  The\nApplicant has had further discussions with the law firm, but he has not been able to\nreach an acceptable payment agreement with them.  (Transcript at 54-56.)  The\nApplicant will continue to work with this law firm until this debt is settled.\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owes approximately $3,942.00\nfor a credit card debt.  There appears to be confusion about who the successor in\ninterest is for this debt.  In February 2009, the Applicant was told by a collection agency\nthat the same law firm which is handling subparagraph 1.b. is also the collection agency\nfor this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  The law firm denies any knowledge of the debt.\n(Transcript at 36-37, 57.)  Once again, the Applicant indicated that he is ready, willing\nand able to resolve this debt.  The Applicant will continue to work with this law firm until\nthis debt is settled.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant has worked for his current employer for about a year and a half.\nHis supervisor states that the Applicant is \u201cone of the few outstanding employees I have\nhired.\u201d  The supervisor goes on to say, \u201cHis [the Applicant\u2019s] demeanor and character\nspeaks to his honesty and integrity.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nThe Applicant submitted evidence that he successfully paid off an arrearage on\nanother account in November 2008.  This debt was not alleged in the SOR.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C.)  This payment is not reflected in the Government\u2019s most recent credit report\nof March 16, 2009.  (Government Exhibit 6.)\nThe Government\u2019s credit bureau reports, and the Applicant\u2019s records, show that\nhe has significantly reduced his indebtedness.  The Applicant\u2019s records also show that\nhis cash flow situation has improved.  His parents have agreed in writing to waive the\nApplicant $500.00 a month rent, and charge only $200.00 a month for utilities, for the\nnext two years.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 4; Transcript at 66-69.)  The Applicant submits\nthat this supports his argument that he shows good judgment with regards to his debts.\nHe also submits that, with these additional funds, he will be able to negotiate and\nsuccessfully pay his two remaining past due debts.  (Government Exhibit 6; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit I at 5.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes the debts set forth in SOR Paragraph 1.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, . . . or a\ndeath, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  These mitigating conditions do not apply in this case. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 20(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d  In addition, \u00b6 20(d) applies where, \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nHere, the Applicant became indebted due to overspending on his family over several\nyears.  Beginning in 2007, the Applicant got a new job, made more money, and began\nto take care of his indebtedness.  He has paid in full the debt in subparagraph 1.a.  In\naddition, he has been working diligently to resolve his other two debts.  For whatever\nreason, the Applicant has not been getting cooperation from the law firm that holds\nthese two debts.  I find that the Applicant has the ability to resolve these debts, and he\nhas made a good faith attempt to pay them.  The fact that they are not currently paid is\nthrough no fault of the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n\n6\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of his youth, a growing family, and his father\u2019s health problems.  As\nstated above, he has paid in full one of the debts stated in the SOR and has attempted\nto resolve the other two without success.  As stated above, he will attempt to resolve\nthese two debts as soon as possible.  The Applicant has behaved reasonably and\nappropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.  Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is\nclose to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 2, 2005. On \nApril 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E and J. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 15, 2009; answered it on May 1, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on May \n4, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 18, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on July 9, 2009. The hearing was tentatively scheduled for August \n19, 2009. Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance until September 16, 2009, due \nto conflicting obligations (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I). I granted his request, and DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 13, 2009, rescheduling the hearing for September \n16, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony \nof three witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J, which were \nadmitted without objection.  \n \nI kept the record open until September 25, 2009, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX K and L, and he resubmitted \nAX D and E, previously admitted. The cover letter and facsimile cover page for \nApplicant\u2019s additional exhibits are attached to the record as HX II. Department \nCounsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s additional evidence is attached to the record as HX \nIII. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 24, 2009. The record closed on \nSeptember 25, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His \nresponses to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a were ambiguous, and I have \ntreated them as denials. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant was born in Ethiopia on June 12, 1959. He was married in October \n1981. He obtained a college degree in Ethiopia. He came to the U.S. in April 1984 and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in July 1990. His wife became a U.S. citizen in February 1995. \nThey have two daughters, born in 1989 and 1995. The older daughter is a college \nsenior and the younger is in the ninth grade (Tr. 48-49). He attended a community \ncollege from September 1989 to November 1991, but he dropped out before receiving a \ndegree or certificate. He attended another community college from April to September \n1997 and received a certificate in information technology systems. He has worked in the \nfield of computer science since about 1998 (Tr. 76). \n \nApplicant has worked for various federal contractors and held a security \nclearance since 1995. In addition, he has worked part-time as a security guard at a \nfederal agency since 1994 (Tr. 46). \n \nApplicant worked for a federal contractor as a network technician from \nSeptember 1998 to March 2000. He resigned from this job after being accused of \nviewing pornographic materials on a government computer. A summary of a personal \nsubject interview conducted in April 2008 refers twice to his resignation. It first recites \nthat Applicant was \u201cforced to resign,\u201d and it later states he was \u201casked to resign\u201d as a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nresult of his conduct (GX 2 at 3). In response to DOHA interrogatories on August 5, \n2008, Applicant reviewed this summary and agreed it was accurate (GX 2 at 2).  \n \nIn response to the same interrogatories, Applicant added a statement that he \nexperienced many pop-up links as he browsed the internet to find out why the network \nwas slow. He stated he usually deleted them immediately and did not view them (GX 2 \nat 6).  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he watched pop-up pornographic materials for \nfive or 10 minutes on about 30 occasions (Tr. 56-57). He denied being forced to resign \n(Tr. 55), but he admitted that he resigned because he was embarrassed by the \naccusation and ashamed of his conduct (Tr. 59-61, 84). He did not tell his wife why he \nresigned until he received the SOR (Tr. 87, 104). At the time of his resignation, he told \nhis wife he had asked to be moved to another contract because it was too expensive to \nwork in the area and he was not comfortable with his co-workers (Tr. 105-06). \n \nApplicant presented a statement from an expert in information technology, \nattesting that in March 1999 through March 2000, when Applicant viewed the \npornographic pop-ups, software programs to filter pop-ups were not robust or mature. \nConsequently, anyone opening an email containing spyware or pop-ups could appear to \nhave intentionally visited pornographic internet sites (AX H). Applicant had never met \nthe expert, and there is no evidence that the expert was familiar with the circumstances \nin which Applicant viewed the pornographic pop-ups (Tr. 89). \n \nIn January 2001, Applicant was charged with two counts of illegally soliciting \nfares at an airport. He testified the incidents occurred when a friend who operated an \nairport shuttle service asked him to meet a customer at a local airport, because the \nfriend was scheduled to be elsewhere. While looking for the customer, Applicant offered \nto transport another individual, who was an undercover policeman. He was issued a \nticket for the illegal solicitation. In response to DOHA interrogatories and in his hearing \ntestimony, he stated that he did not know his conduct was illegal (Tr. 97; GX 3 at 3). \nHowever, he solicited another individual about ten minutes later and was issued a \nsecond ticket. He was not arrested (GX 3 at 3; Tr. 91-94, 102). He hired a lawyer \nbecause he was facing a $1,000 fine for each solicitation (Tr. 94). He found the \nprospect of large fines \u201cshocking\u201d and a source of \u201cbig trouble\u201d in his household (Tr. 95-\n96). He was convicted of one of the two counts of illegal solicitation and fined $300 plus \n$55 in court costs (GX 4). \n \n \nApplicant was hired by his current employer as a desktop analyst in March 2004, \nand promoted to project manager in December 2005 (AX I at 1). He supervises about \n30 employees and assists the manager of the desktop support unit (Tr. 114). He has a \nreputation as an extremely conscientious employee. He usually arrives at work at 4:30 \na.m., at least an hour and a half before his scheduled starting time (Tr. 49-50). In July \n2004, he was one of about 25 employees, out of a total of 500, who were recognized as  \n\u201ccharter members\u201d of the communications team working in the Pentagon (AX J; Tr. 73-\n\n \n4 \n \n \n74). Based on his performance, he received substantial pay raises in June and July \n2006 (AX I at 2-3).  \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in November 2005, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to the question asking if, during the last seven years, he was fired, \nquit a job after being told he would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following \nallegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance, or left a job for any other \nreasons under unfavorable circumstances. He did not disclose his resignation under \nunfavorable circumstances in March 2000. He testified he did not disclose it because it \nwas embarrassing (Tr. 104).  \n \nOn the same security clearance application, Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestions about his police record. He did not disclose his conviction for illegally \nsoliciting fares. In his response to DOHA interrogatories in November 2008, he stated \nthat the outcome of the incident was so minor that he forgot about it (GX 3 at 3). At the \nhearing, he testified he did not think it was necessary to disclose it and he \u201ccompletely \nforgot\u201d about it when he was completing his security clearance application (Tr. 70-71). \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer regards him as an excellent employee who has \nexhibited the highest standards of security and management responsibilities (AX A). He \ntestified that Applicant is reliable and \u201cprobably the best project manager we have.\u201d He \ntestified repeatedly that he does not expect recurrence of Applicant\u2019s inappropriate use \nof computers, airport rule violations, and intentional omissions of embarrassing \ninformation on his security clearance (Tr. 116-18, 120, 125-26). He testified Applicant \nhas been very straightforward and honest about his past mistakes (Tr. 118).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor has known Applicant since May 2008 and has \nfrequent, daily contact with him (Tr. 137). He regards Applicant as honest, trustworthy, \nand very reliable (Tr. 140-42). He does not believe that Applicant\u2019s previous behavior \nwill recur (Tr. 148-49).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security manager, who has more than 14 years of experience and \nhas known him for more than three years, believes he has high integrity and a strong \nsense of security awareness (AX C). She testified that in September 2005 she initiated \na security program that includes strong emphasis on self-reporting of \u201csecurity \nanomalies\u201d in personal life (Tr. 168). She is aware of the allegations in the SOR, but she \ndecided to testify for Applicant because she considers him a responsible and valued \nemployee. Applicant\u2019s hearing was the first and only time in her career that she had \ntestified for an applicant (Tr. 172). She described Applicant as having a \u201cstrong sense of \nintegrity,\u201d being very \u201csecurity-aware,\u201d and taking great pride in his work (Tr. 172). She \ntestified she believed Applicant would never repeat his past mistakes (Tr. 187). She \nbelieves Applicant would voluntarily disclose embarrassing information because of the \neffectiveness of her company\u2019s education program (Tr. 193).  \n \nA co-worker who has known Applicant for six years and is aware of the \nallegations in the SOR finds it \u201cabsolutely unimaginable\u201d that Applicant would engage in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsuch misconduct again, because of his strong character and dedication to his work and \nhis family (AX L at 2). Another co-worker who has known Applicant for four years \nconsiders him a person of high integrity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. He \ndescribes Applicant as a person who combines operating \u201cby the book\u201d with great \ncompassion for those he leads (AX F). \n \nApplicant\u2019s senior program manager, a retired brigadier general in the Air \nNational Guard, submitted a lengthy statement on Applicant\u2019s behalf.1 He has worked in \nthe same secured work space with Applicant for five years. He is aware of the \nallegations in the SOR. He describes Applicant as a person \u201cwho strives to do the right \nthing, takes initiative, and leads by example.\u201d He is convinced that Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct and his failure to disclose it on his security clearance application will not \nrecur (AX K at 1-2).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not a determination as to \n                                                          \n1 His senior program manager was scheduled to testify personally, but was unable to attend the hearing \nbecause of the unexpected death of an immediate family member.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant resigned from employment in March 2000, in lieu of \ntermination, for viewing inappropriate websites on a government computer (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nhe falsified his security clearance application by deliberately failing to disclose that he \nleft his employment in March 2000 under unfavorable circumstances (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and \nhe falsified his security clearance application by failing to disclose that he had been \ncharged and convicted of illegally soliciting fares and fined a total of $355, including \ncosts (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The security concern relating to Guideline E is set out in AG & 15 as \nfollows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe evidence supporting the allegation that Applicant resigned \u201cin lieu of \ntermination\u201d is conflicting. The security investigator\u2019s summary of his interview of \nApplicant in April 2008 recites that Applicant was \u201cforced to resign\u201d and was \u201casked to \nresign.\u201d Although Applicant reviewed this summary and stated it was accurate, he \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninsisted at the hearing that he did not resign in lieu of termination. I need not resolve \nthis conflict, however, because Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing is sufficient to \nestablish that he resigned under unfavorable circumstances and was required to \ndisclose that fact on his security clearance application.  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \nsecurity clearance application is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant \nadmitted he deliberately did not disclose his resignation under unfavorable \ncircumstances, thus raising AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions regarding his nondisclosure of the illegal solicitation were \nequivocal. He admitted that he should have disclosed it, but he offered excuses for not \ndoing so. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden \nof proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when he omitted the information.  \n \nApplicant claimed that he omitted mention of his conviction of illegal solicitation \nbecause he forgot about it. I find this explanation implausible and unconvincing. He was \nable to recount the incident in detail when he was interviewed by a security investigator. \nHe testified he was shocked when faced with the prospect of paying $2,000 in fines. He \nincurred legal expenses to hire a lawyer, and encountered \u2018big problems\u201d at home \nbecause of the potential financial impact of his conduct. Under all the circumstances, I \nam not persuaded that he forgot about the incident. I am satisfied he deliberately \nomitted the information.   \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s resignation from \nemployment in March 2000 are as follows: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information\u201d; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; [and] (4) evidence of significant misuse of \nGovernment or other employer's time or resources\u201d; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s resignation in March 2000 for viewing pornographic materials on his \ngovernment computer raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). His conviction for illegal \nsolicitation at the airport is not an offense that was likely to make him vulnerable to \ncoercion or exploitation. However, although he claimed he did not know his solicitation \nwas illegal, he continued to solicit potential fares after receiving the first ticket, \ndemonstrating an unwillingness to follow the rules, thereby raising AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), (c), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from falsification of a security clearance application \nmay be mitigated if that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(a). Applicant made no effort to correct his omissions until he was confronted with the \nevidence by a security investigator in April 2008, more than two and a half years after \nsubmitting his falsified application. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of a government computer by viewing pornography for five to ten \nminutes at a time on about 30 occasions was not minor, infrequent, or an event \noccurring under unique circumstances. On the other hand, it occurred more than nine \nyears ago. Applicant\u2019s embarrassment, greater maturity, and realization that such \nconduct can cost him his job and harm his family make it unlikely to recur. His illegal \nsolicitation was minor, happened twice within ten minutes, and occurred more than eight \nyears ago. His falsification of his current security clearance application was not minor \nand did not happen under unique circumstances. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is established \nfor the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but not for the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his misuse of his computer \nand is embarrassed by it. He has acknowledged his illegal solicitation. He has \nacknowledged his failure to disclose his resignation under unfavorable circumstances \non his security clearance application, but was less than candid about the reasons for his \nfailure to disclose his conviction of illegal solicitation. He is devoted to his job, but he \nresorted to deception to protect it. He has received additional security training about the \nimpact of personal conduct on security and the importance of self-reporting \u201csecurity \nanomalies\u201d in personal life. I conclude this mitigating condition is established for the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but not for the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant has disclosed his misuse of a \ngovernment computer and the reasons for his resignation in March 2000 to his \nsupervisors, several coworkers, and his wife. The illegal solicitation was not an offense \nthat was likely to make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He has \ndisclosed his falsification of his security clearance application. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is established for all the allegations in the SOR. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his termination \nunder unfavorable circumstances and his citation and conviction for unlawful solicitation \nof fare was a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The concern raised by criminal \nconduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. The relevant disqualifying \nconditions are \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c), respectively. \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberate and materially false answer on a security clearance application is a \nserious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  \n \n \nFalse statements having the potential to affect a final agency decision are \n\u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. In addition, false statements or \n\n \n10 \n \n \nomissions are material if they are capable of causing an agency to forego and \ninvestigation, or are capable of misleading an agency in its investigatory functions. \nISCR Case No. 91-0901 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 1993), 1993 WL 255979 (citing federal cases \ninterpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001).  \n \nI do not believe that Applicant\u2019s conviction of what was tantamount to a traffic \noffense would have affected a decision on his continued eligibility for a clearance, \naffected a decision whether to investigate further, or would have misled the government \nin its investigatory functions. Thus, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s intentional omission of his \nconviction for illegal solicitation of a fare, while sufficient to raise a disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline E, was not sufficient to constitute a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s resignation under unfavorable circumstances was \na material fact, and his intentional omission of that fact on his security clearance \napplication raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct may be mitigated by evidence \nthat \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). For the \nreasons set out above in my discussion of AG \u00b6 17(c) under Guideline E, I conclude \nthat this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigating if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). Applicant expressed remorse for his intentional failure to disclose his resignation \nunder unfavorable circumstances. He has established a reputation with his current \nemployer for high integrity and dedication. As noted above, however, he was not \ncompletely candid during his security interview in April 2008 and at the hearing. Thus, I \nam not satisfied that he has been rehabilitated, and I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant has worked for government contractors and held a clearance for about \n24 years. His misconduct was not the product of immaturity or inexperience. He was 41 \nyears old when he resigned from previous employment under unfavorable \ncircumstances, and 45 years old when he falsified his security clearance application. He \nis very dedicated to his job and he performs it with dedication and skill. Unfortunately, \nhe has demonstrated that he will engage in deception to protect his job. His security \nmanager is confident that his training in the importance of self-disclosure will preclude \nrecurrence, but I do not share that confidence after carefully reviewing his conduct, his \nstatements to a security investigator, and his testimony at the hearing. I gave great \nweight to the strongly supportive statement of Applicant\u2019s senior program manager, a \nretired general officer in the Air National Guard, but Applicant\u2019s lack of complete candor \nduring the investigative process and at the hearing leaves me with doubts about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and \nJ, evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Garcia,  Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Michael E. Satti, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has a history of repeated drunk driving incidents and treatment for\ndiagnosed alcohol dependence. She relapsed after her latest arrest for driving under the\ninfluence in December 2008, despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings\nsince February 2009. Alcohol consumption concerns are not fully mitigated. Clearance\ndenied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn January 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that provided the basis for its decision to deny her a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 7, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant initially answered the SOR on March 3, 2009. She failed to respond to\nSOR 1.e, and her answer was returned to her. On November 27, 2009, Applicant filed a\ncomplete response and she requested a hearing. On December 29, 2009, the case was\nassigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for her. On January 8, 2010, I scheduled a\nhearing for February 4, 2010.\nOn February 2, 2010, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance, and he\nrequested a brief continuance, which was granted. With the parties agreement, on\nMarch 9, 2010, I rescheduled the hearing for March 31, 2010. I convened the hearing as\nrescheduled. Six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C)\nwere admitted without objection. Applicant and two witnesses also testified on her\nbehalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 9, 2010. Based on review of the\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant\nconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and intoxication, from about 1974 to at least\nFebruary 2008 (SOR 1.a); that she was convicted of drunk driving offenses committed\nin June 1994 (SOR 1.b) and February 2006 (SOR 1.c); that she received alcohol-related\ntreatment from May 12, 2006 to June 27, 2006, for diagnosed alcohol dependence but\ndid not complete the program (SOR 1.d); and that she was charged with driving under\nthe influence (DUI) in December 2008 (SOR 1.e). Applicant denied that she had a\nproblem with alcohol in 1994, although she acknowledged that she had consumed to\nexcess on the occasion of her DUI, and that she had been arrested for drunk driving as\nalleged in February 2006 and in December 2008. Applicant admitted receiving alcohol\ntreatment in mid-2006 and that she failed to attend the last two meetings. As of March\n2009, she was attending AA and a weekly substance abuse treatment program. After\nconsidering the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old material technical aide, who has worked for her\npresent employer since 1979, with the exception of two years when she went out on\nstrike. (Tr. 89.) She holds a Secret security clearance that was last granted to her in\nFebruary 2001. (Ex. 1.)\nAfter Applicant reached drinking age in 1974, she began consuming coffee\nbrandy or Kahlua mixed with milk about twice a month on the weekends while\nsocializing with friends. While in college from 1974 to 1979, Applicant consumed about\ntwo to three glasses of wine at a sitting, three to six times a month. (Ex. 2, 6.) In the\nearly 1990s, she began drinking alone at home or with friends at bars. When out at\nbars, she usually limited herself to two or three glasses of wine. (Ex. 6.) She consumed\none or 1.5 bottles of wine to intoxication at home some weekends. Work was stressful\nbecause she had a lot of responsibility and received no support from her supervisor.\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 110-11.)\n\n3\nOn June 19, 1994, Applicant, whose weight varies from 96 to 98 pounds\n(Answer), consumed three or four mixed drinks with a friend. Although she felt\nintoxicated, she proceeded with plans to meet family. En route to her parents\u2019 home,\nshe was arrested for driving while intoxicated after she failed field sobriety tests. She\nsubmitted to breathalyzer testing, which registered her blood alcohol level at .385%\nabout a half hour after her arrest. (Ex. 5.) She was sentenced to complete a ten-session\nalcohol education class (Tr. 117-19.), to pay a fine, and her license was suspended for\nthree months. After Applicant completed the DUI education program, she was required\nto attend ten weeks of alcohol counseling and once weekly AA meetings because of her\nhigh blood alcohol content when she was arrested. (Ex. 2, 6.) She completed the\noutpatient program, which included AA meetings once a week. Applicant did not find the\nAA meetings supportive, and she stopped attending when they were no longer required.\n(Tr. 121.) \nFive weeks into her counseling, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security\nService investigator on November 17, 1994. Applicant indicated that as a result of her\nalcohol counseling, she realized that she was drinking too much. Abstinent since\nbeginning her alcohol education classes, Applicant averred that she might not drink\nalcohol again, and that she would \u201cprobably severely decrease [her] consumption\u201d if she\ndrank. (Ex. 6.)\nIn the mid-1990s, she was hired into her current department at work. Her duties\nwere much less stressful than in her previous job. (Tr. 113.) Around 1997, she resumed\ndrinking, one or two glasses of wine a night. (Tr. 126.) But she also drank one to 1.5\nbottles of wine to intoxication at home some weekends. She was convinced that she\ncould control her drinking (Tr. 129), and she continued drinking in this pattern until\nFebruary 2006, when she was arrested on suspicion of DUI. After she had consumed at\nleast 1.5 bottles of wine at home (Tr. 129.), Applicant decided to drive to the store, even\nthough she felt \u201ctipsy.\u201d She was pulled over for erratic driving, and failed field sobriety\ntests. Based on breathalyser results, she was charged with DUI. In March 2006, she\nwas sentenced to attend an eight-week DUI school at a substance abuse treatment\nfacility (facility X), fined $500, and her driving privileges were suspended for three\nmonths. (Ex. 2; Tr. 129-30.)\nAfter completing the DUI program, Applicant voluntarily attended an intensive\noutpatient treatment program at the facility from May 12, 2006 to June 27, 2006. (Tr. 91,\n131.) At intake, she reported an increase in alcohol consumption over the past year,\nthat she had consumed 1.5 bottles of wine on 20 of the last 28 days, and that she\nneeded help to stop drinking long-term. She also reported a history of depression, well\ncontrolled on Effexor medication. (Ex. 3.) Applicant was ambivalent about becoming\ninvolved in recommended AA. She went to a couple of AA meetings while in treatment,\nbut she did not like the religious overtones. (Tr. 94.) Applicant left facility X\u2019s outpatient\nprogram early against medical advice because her insurance would no longer cover the\ncost. (Ex. 2; Tr. 133.) Discharge documentation reflects she was diagnosed by a staff\nlicensed clinical social worker with alcohol dependence and anxiety disorder, not\notherwise specified, and that she was unwilling to attend self-help groups. (Ex. 3.)\nApplicant came to believe that she is an alcoholic (Tr. 134.), but she resumed drinking\n\nTreatment records reflect that she attended the outpatient program in 2006. (Ex. 3.)\n1\n4\nafter she left the outpatient treatment program, in part due to stress over issues\ninvolving her mortgage. (Tr. 136.) She consumed one glass of wine each evening and\nmore on weekends (Ex. 2.), although at one point, she abstained for three months. (Tr.\n96.)\nOn January 4, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for an update of her Secret clearance. She disclosed\nher February 2006 DUI and indicated that she was treated at alcohol treatment facility X\nfrom May 2007 to July 2007 [sic].  (Ex. 1.) On February 19, 2008, Applicant was\n1\ninterviewed by a government investigator about her treatment and her alcohol\nconsumption. Applicant indicated that she voluntarily pursued alcohol treatment at\nalcohol treatment facility X because she felt she had a problem with alcohol. Applicant\ndenied she had been diagnosed with an alcohol problem. She admitted she was\ndrinking 12 alcohol drinks per month, although she no longer drove after drinking.\nApplicant expressed her intent to reduce her alcohol intake. She had no explanation for\nwhy she continued to drink. (Ex.  2.)\nOn December 6, 2008, Applicant was arrested for DUI after she rear-ended a\nvehicle that was stopped at a traffic intersection. She had been drinking wine at a\nholiday party, but felt that she could drive safely. (Ex. 4; Tr. 139-40.) In February 2009,\nshe was convicted of the charge, and sentenced to one year probation, 100 hours of\ncommunity service, and fines. She lost her driving privileges for 14 months. (Tr. 97.)\nApplicant completed her community service for a human services organization within\nwalking distance of her work. (Tr. 99.)\nTo regain her license, Applicant was required to attend a substance abuse\ntreatment program recognized by the state department of motor vehicles (DMV). She\ncompleted Phase I, consisting of a 48-hour weekend retreat, on February 15, 2009. She\nattended Phase II, consisting of at least 20 hours of aftercare counseling sessjons, and\nAA three times a week, between February 24, 2009 and April 14, 2009 (Tr. 141.), and\nher license was restored to her in February 2010. (Tr. 101.) She had not commenced\nPhase III as of her security clearance hearing. Three of the four required meetings were\nscheduled for April 10, 2010, July 10, 2010, and October 9, 2010. The last session is to\nbe held in 2011 on a date that had not been determined as of March 2010. (Ex. C; Tr.\n98, 101.) \nApplicant drank alcohol, \u201ca few glasses of wine here and there\u201d after her\nDecember 2008 DUI, including on March 18, 2009. (Tr. 61, 96-97, 145.) On March 24,\n2009, at the request of adult probation, Applicant was evaluated by a state-certified\nalcohol and drug counselor affiliated with a nonprofit substance abuse treatment\nagency. (Ex. A; Tr. 58-59.) Applicant reported to the clinician that she had consumed a\nglass of wine on March 18, 2009, which she did not think was a problem for her. (Tr.\n61.) The counselor did not make a referral for further treatment because Applicant was\n\u201cdoing what she needed to do\u201d in attending the program mandated by the DMV. The\ncounselor told Applicant to call if she felt she needed additional treatment. (Tr. 58, 72.)  \n\n5\nIn August 2009, Applicant voluntarily began attending a women\u2019s support group\nrun by the counselor because she wanted support beyond AA. From August 14, 2009 to\nNovember 16, 2009, Applicant attended 12 group sessions (18 hours total), which\nstressed the value of 12-step groups, spirituality, and triggers to alcohol use, in the\ncontext of relapse prevention. (Ex. B; Tr. 48-50.) Applicant denied any temptation to\ndrink throughout her treatment (Tr. 64.), and she attended different types of AA\nmeetings in compliance with her treatment plan, so that she could figure out for herself\nwhat was best for her. (Tr. 68, 75.) About halfway through her group sessions, Applicant\nrealized that if alcohol had ever been a problem for her, one drink of wine could be a\nproblem. She also came to see that AA was not an imposition, but rather it provided her\nsupport and insight away from a formal group setting. (Ex. B; Tr. 51, 61, 71, 102.) The\ncounselor considered Applicant to be an alcohol abuser rather than alcohol dependent\n(Tr. 74.), but she advised Applicant to abstain from alcohol because Applicant was on\nantidepressant medication and had problems in the past with alcohol. (Tr. 76.) Applicant\nhad told the counselor that she had identified a sponsor in AA and the clinician advised\nApplicant to continue in AA with her sponsor. (Tr. 67.)\nAs of March 2010, the counselor considered Applicant\u2019s prognosis for\nmaintaining sobriety to be excellent, provided Applicant stays involved in AA and has a\nsponsor. (Ex. B; Tr. 53, 66, 77.) This assessment was based on her facilitation of\nApplicant\u2019s group sessions from August to November 2009. The counselor had no\ncontact with Applicant after the group therapy sessions apart from a recent conversation\nwith Applicant about testifying at the hearing on Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.\nApplicant informed her at that time that she was doing well. (Tr. 69.)\nApplicant considers herself to be a \u201crecovering alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 144.) She drank\nalcohol twice after completing her counseling in November 2009, most recently in\nFebruary 2010 when she consumed \u201ca very large glass of wine\u201d in her home. She\npurchased the wine. (Tr. 160.) Applicant had no explanation for what led her to drink.\n(Tr. 152-54.) She poured out the remainder of the bottle and went immediately to an AA\nmeeting after she drank. (Tr. 153.)\nApplicant has attended AA at least once a week since late February 2009, and\nshe tries to get to at least three meetings a week. (Tr. 95, 156-57.) Applicant does not\nintend to consume alcohol in the future because she recognizes, by her own efforts to\nquit drinking or reduce her consumption in that past, that \u201csooner or later one glass of\nwine is going to be more than one glass of wine.\u201d (Tr. 102-03.) She completed the first\nstep of the AA program in that she admitted to herself that she is powerless in the face\nof alcohol. She has not completed other steps of the AA program (Tr. 143.), although\nshe plans to complete the other 11 steps eventually. (Tr. 151.) Applicant has yet to find\na sponsor. There is one woman in AA with whom Applicant talks, but this woman\naddresses recovery in religious terms. (Tr. 147.) Applicant has not called anyone in AA\nsince December 2009. (Tr. 163.) She did not think about contacting anyone in AA\nbefore she drank the wine in February 2010. (Tr. 164.)\nApplicant has not been in a bar in the past two years. She has been in the\npresence of family members while they have been drinking on special occasions, such\n\n6\nas the Christmas holiday, but they usually do not drink when she is dining with them.\n(Tr. 114.)\nApplicant is currently under the care of a psychiatrist for her antidepressant\nmedication (Effexor). In February 2010, she started taking Campral, which suppresses\nthe desire for alcohol, which for her is more mental than physical. She feels more\nsecure in her recovery taking the drug. (Tr. 103-04, 144.) The psychiatrist suggested\nshe take the Campral after she told him that she had relapsed. (Tr. 161.) In March 2010,\nshe began once weekly counseling to help her remain sober. (Tr. 148-50.) \nApplicant has never reported to work under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 103.)\nApplicant enjoys her present work for the defense contractor. (Tr. 107.) Applicant\u2019s\ndirect supervisor for the past six years has never observed her to be under the influence\nof alcohol on the job (Tr. 26.), and he has no concerns about her judgment and\nreliability at work. (Tr. 33.)  Applicant has not discussed the specifics of her alcohol\nproblem with him other than to indicate that she did not enjoy her rehabilitation. (Tr. 33)\nHe learned from Applicant\u2019s father that she had been arrested for DUI. (Tr. 29.) In 2008\nand again in late summer 2009 or early fall 2009, Applicant\u2019s supervisor was required to\ncounsel her about absenteeism because she had no vacation or personal time left. (Tr.\n34-36.)\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\n\n7\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant has three drunk driving convictions that implicate AG \u00b6\n22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d Despite her abusive relationship with alcohol from the early 1990s,\nthere has been no impact on her work performance, so AG \u00b6 22(b), \u201calcohol-related\nincidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired\ncondition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d is inapplicable. \nHowever, the responsibility for protecting classified information is not limited to\nduty hours. She showed extremely poor judgment in driving with a blood alcohol content\nof .385% in June 1994. After two years of abstinence, she resumed drinking wine in\nquantities of up to 1.5 bottles to intoxication at home on some weekends. By 2006, she\nhad developed a serious alcohol problem, as evidenced by her second DUI and her\nabusive drinking thereafter, leading to her third DUI. AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies.\nFurthermore, because Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependency by a\nlicensed clinical social worker at facility X in May 2006, and with alcohol abuse by the\nstate-certified counselor who assessed her at the request of adult probation in March\n2009 and then treated her in the fall of 2009, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse\n\n8\nor alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d is implicated. The evidence also supports\napplication of AG \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d Because of her premature departure\nfrom facility X\u2019s intensive outpatient program in 2006, it cannot be said that Applicant\ncompleted that alcohol rehabilitation program. She also has yet to complete Phase III of\nthe substance abuse treatment program mandated after her third DUI. But she\nsuccessfully completed two months of women\u2019s group therapy facilitated by a state-\ncertified drug and alcohol counselor. By November 2009, Applicant had received\nsufficient alcohol rehabilitation treatment to fulfill the treatment component of AG \u00b6 22(f).\nHer consumption of alcohol on two occasions thereafter, including in February 2010\nwhen she drank \u201ca very large glass\u201d of wine, qualify as relapses, whether or not she\nbecame intoxicated, given she had been advised by substance abuse treatment\nprofessionals to abstain from alcohol.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s drinking has been limited since August 2009, when she\nentered the women\u2019s group, her history of abuse is too recent and recurrent to favorably\nconsider mitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much times has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser),\u201d is implicated only in part. Applicant admits she is powerless over\nalcohol and considers herself a recovering alcoholic. She took steps to address the\nproblem by voluntarily entering facility X\u2019s intensive outpatient program in 2006, and the\nwomen\u2019s group in 2009. But her recent purchase and consumption of alcohol against\ntherapeutic advice, and her reliance on Campral medication to make her feel more\nstable in her recovery from alcohol, are consistent with the diagnosis of alcohol\ndependency rather than alcohol abuse. Moreover, the counselor who diagnosed\nApplicant with alcohol abuse rather than alcohol dependence may not have been fully\naware of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption history. She knew little about Applicant\u2019s prior\nDUI offenses or her alcohol rehabilitation treatment at facility X. (Tr. 64.) Applicant drank\nalcohol, \u201ca few glasses of wine here and there\u201d after her arrest, including on March 18,\n2009, before her evaluation for adult probation. She did not drink while attending the\nwomen\u2019s group from August to November 2009, but relapsed at least twice since then.\nAbstinence lasting a few months is not enough to establish a pattern in light of her\nhistory, which includes two DUI offenses after she had been free of alcohol for as long\nas 2.5 years in the past, from June 1994 to 1997. \nAG \u00b6 23(c), \u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and\nis making satisfactory progress,\u201d is designed to encourage employees to seek treatment\nwithout fear of denial or loss of their clearance eligibility. At the same time, the\nDepartment of Defense justifiably requires current employees to make the progress\nnecessary to avoid a relapse and to meet their need for treatment. Applicant\u2019s decision\n\nThe counselor who facilitated Applicant\u2019s group therapy in the fall of 2009 gave Applicant an excellent\n2\nprognosis (Ex. B), but with the following caveat:\nW ell, I have to couch that a little bit. Because if she\u2019s doing AA and if she\u2019s still got her\nsponsor, and if she is under any kind of\u2013of she\u2019s getting any kind of mental health or\ncounseling treatment\u2013all of those things, I truly believe\u2013I\u2019m a behaviorist\u2013I truly believe that\nwe can rewire our brains. Does that mean I think she should drink again or could? No,\nbecause for her, it\u2019s been a problem. (Tr. 77.)\nAG \u00b6 2(a) requires consideration of the following nine factors:\n3\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n9\nto purchase and drink wine in February 2010, knowing that she risked her sobriety by\ndoing so, raises concerns about her commitment to recovery.\nIn addition to completing outpatient counseling, Applicant has not gone a week\nwithout going to an AA meeting since late February 2009, when she was required to\nattend under Phase II of a mandated substance abuse treatment program. However,\ndespite her treatment and the regularity of her attendance at AA, Applicant has yet to\ndemonstrate a \u201cclear and established pattern\u201d of abstinence, which is required of those\nwith diagnosed dependency for mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(d). See AG \u00b6 23(d) (stating,\n\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a\nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program\u201d). Limited relapses are not unexpected, even by persons\ncommitted to their recovery, but Applicant does not have a sufficiently sustained period\nof abstinence. Moreover, while Applicant was given an excellent prognosis for\nmaintaining her sobriety, the prognosis was rendered by a clinician who considered it\nsignificant that Applicant continue with her sponsor in AA.  This clinician, whose\n2\ntherapeutic relationship with Applicant ended in November 2009, seemed to not know\nthat Applicant never had a sponsor in AA or that Applicant had relapsed since\nNovember 2009 despite regular attendance at AA. The evidence does not show that\nthis counselor was fully aware of the extent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use over the years.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a).  \n3\n\n10\nSerious judgment concerns are raised by Applicant\u2019s repeated drunk driving and\nher history of relapse after counseling. Applicant is credited with taking some steps on\nher own to deal with her serious alcohol problem, and there is no evidence that she\nbecame intoxicated from consuming a  \u201cvery large glass\u201d of wine in February 2010. I\nhave no reason to doubt her testimony that she stopped after that one drink, and that\nshe emptied out the rest of the bottle. She exercised good judgment in going to an AA\nmeeting immediately. That said, her commitment to the AA program is only in its infancy\nat this point, despite her regular attendance at AA meetings since late February 2009.\nUntil October 2009, she viewed AA as more of an imposition than an aid to her\nrecovery. She did not consider contacting anyone in AA before she drank in February\n2010, and had not found a sponsor in AA by late March 2010. Counseling and Campral\nmedication initiated weeks before her hearing appear to be helping her feel more secure\nin her recovery, but these treatments are too recent to rely on in assessing the risk of a\nrelapse. While Applicant has not allowed her off-duty drinking to affect her work\nperformance, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nElizabeth M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $41,000 for 23 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.w). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also provided explanatory information with his response. In essence, he asserted his debts were the combined result of job lay-offs, medical problems, and a marital separation. In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s admissions, after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and the parties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old electronics engineer for a large defense contractor, where he has worked since October 2007. He has worked since at least August 2000 in the information technology and electronics industry. However, he was unemployed due to layoffs between January and May 2007, and in September 2007. (Gx. 1) Appellant testified he was also laid off twice in 2000. (Tr. 29) Applicant and his wife have been married since May 2001. They separated in 2007, but reconciled in March 2009. (Tr. 37) They have two children, ages 6 and 3. (Gx. 1) Applicant has earned a bachelor of science degree in electronics engineering and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. He is currently studying for his master\u2019s degree in information systems. (Gx. 1; Tr. 5, 57 - 58) He has funded his education through a combination of public and private student loans. He estimates that when he completes his current master\u2019s program in 18 months,",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. On\nDecember 31, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nMay 14, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfacts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on March 12, 2009, and I convened a hearing on March 31, 2009. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5),\nwhich were included in the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf. I left the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant information\nfrom the Applicant. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009.\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was received on April 16, 2009, and included in the\nrecord without objection, as Ax. A.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $41,000\nfor 23 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.w). Applicant admitted all of the SOR\nallegations. He also provided explanatory information with his response. In essence, he\nasserted his debts were the combined result of job lay-offs, medical problems, and a\nmarital separation. In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nafter reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and the parties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the\nfollowing findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old electronics engineer for a large defense contractor,\nwhere he has worked since October 2007. He has worked since at least August 2000 in\nthe information technology and electronics industry. However, he was unemployed due\nto layoffs between January and May 2007, and in September 2007. (Gx. 1) Appellant\ntestified he was also laid off twice in 2000. (Tr. 29)\nApplicant and his wife have been married since May 2001. They separated in\n2007, but reconciled in March 2009. (Tr. 37) They have two children, ages 6 and 3. (Gx.\n1) Applicant has earned a bachelor of science degree in electronics engineering and a\nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration. He is currently studying for his master\u2019s\ndegree in information systems. (Gx. 1; Tr. 5, 57 - 58) He has funded his education\nthrough a combination of public and private student loans. He estimates that when he\ncompletes his current master\u2019s program in 18 months, he will owe about $60,000 in\nstudent loans. The loans are currently in forbearance, with about half of the loans\naccruing interest. (Gx. 3 - 5; Tr. 80)\nWhen he submitted his e-QIP in December 2007, Applicant disclosed that he\nowed several delinquent or past due debts. He also disclosed at least one judgment\nagainst him and his mother for an unpaid loan he co-signed with her. Applicant used a\ncredit report he obtained in order to provide the detailed information he disclosed. (Gx.\n1; Tr. 81) The subsequent background investigation yielded information about the 23\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\ndelinquent debts, judgments and/or repossessions, which are listed in the SOR. (Gx. 2;\nGx. 3) However, the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.s are the same account.\nApplicant has attributed his unpaid debts to his periods of unemployment in 2000\nand 2007. It is unclear when he was unemployed in 2000, and there is a discrepancy\nbetween the employment record he listed in his e-QIP and the dates he gave during his\ntestimony. Applicant also asserted that he accrued his debts when he and his wife were\nseparated in October 2007 through early 2009. He moved to the city where he and his\nfamily now live, while his wife and children remained in their previous residence.\nApplicant had to support two residences from about October 2007, when he moved to\nhis current locale, until March 2009. (Tr. 79)\nApplicant\u2019s wife has suffered a variety of medical problems since 2004. These\ninclude a blood disorder for which she receives blood platelet injections, and an eye\nproblem that resulted in a corneal transplant just before this hearing. (Ax. A) She has\nbeen unable to work for periods of time, but Applicant\u2019s health insurance has covered\nmost of the costs of her treatments. (Tr. 45 - 46)\nAt least since he completed his e-QIP in 2007, Applicant has been aware that he\nhas extensive unpaid debts. In July 2008, he approached the Consumer Credit\nCounseling Service (CCCS) for help in managing his money and negotiating repayment\nterms with his creditors. At that time, he had a negative monthly cash flow (his\nexpenses were  $164 more than his income) and he could not enroll in the CCCS\nprogram. (Gx. 2) CCCS recommended several actions he could take to improve his\nmonthly balance sheet and position him for a repayment program. In February 2009,\nApplicant and CCCS produced a budget that showed he now has a positive monthly\ncash flow of $1,670. Applicant attributed the change to taking in his brother and sister-\nin-law as tenants who are now sharing the expenses and paying rent. However,\nApplicant\u2019s wife is no longer working, thus removing from the balance sheet her $1,300\nmonthly income. (Ax. A; Tr. 71 - 72)\nApplicant has taken out student loans for his two previous degrees and for his\ncurrent course of study. For some of his privately funded student loans, he borrowed as\nmuch as $5,000 more than he needed for tuition and fees. The excess was returned to\nhim after he paid his tuition and related costs. But rather than pay down his student\nloans, he asserted he kept the \u201crefunds\u201d for expenses and to pay off debts. (Tr. 40 - 43,\n59 - 60) Applicant did not present any information to support this claim.\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n3\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\n4\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n5\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.w. The facts thus established show that Applicant owes approximately\n$41,000 in delinquent debts dating back to at least 2002. However, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.h and 1.s are the same account. Applicant has been aware of his delinquent debts\nsince he submitted his 2007 security clearance application. To date, the debts listed in\nthe SOR are still unpaid or otherwise resolved. Applicant insists he is now able to pay\nhis delinquent debts, but he has offered no information that shows he has actually\nbegun making payments. Further, he has increased his overall debt by taking student\nloans in excess of the costs of his ongoing graduate education. He claimed he is using\nthe monies returned to him by the school to pay down his consumer debt, but has not\ndocumented his claim. In another 18 months, he will likely owe more than $60,000 in\ndebt for his student loans by themselves. The record requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response to his financial problems, Applicant tried in 2008 to enroll in a\nrepayment plan with CCCS, but it was determined his monthly finances would not allow\nhim to take advantage of their services. To his credit, he adjusted his spending and took\non renters to defray his household expenses. According to a second CCCS balance\nsheet in February 2009, Applicant had sufficient funds to devote to a meaningful\nrepayment plan. However, Applicant has acknowledged that the figures used included\nhis wife\u2019s income, which, as of the hearing, was no longer available due to her medical\nproblems. In most cases, the foregoing might support application of the mitigating\nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) and AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control). \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(c), it is to Applicant\u2019s benefit that he is enrolled in a CCCS\nprogram. But there is no track record of action here that is likely to yield tangible results.\nDespite being allowed extra time after the hearing to do so, he has not shown that he is,\nin fact, making payments to his creditors through the CCCS. Nor has he shown that he\nhas taken other tangible action to resolve his debts or improve his overall financial\nhealth. He has demonstrated that he is adding to his overall debt load through his\nstudent loans, but has not shown he has devoted that excess either back to the loans\nthemselves or to other delinquent accounts. As to AG \u00b6 20(b), it is true that his wife has\nhad medical problems which probably interrupted her income from time to time. But\nApplicant admitted he has had medical insurance to cover most of his wife\u2019s medical\ncosts and he has not shown that his debts or his inability to resolve them stemmed from\nhis wife\u2019s medical issues. Nor has he shown that his periods of unemployment were to\nblame. He claimed that he was unemployed for about a year when he was laid off in\n\n See footnote 3, supra.\n7\n See footnote 6, supra. \n8\n6\n2007, but his security clearance application shows he was unemployed, at most, for five\nmonths. Nor does the record support his claim he was unemployed in 2000. On\nbalance, the information he presented is insufficient to support application of the\naforementioned mitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 30 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. There is no available information about his reliability or\ntrustworthiness that would support a prediction that he will begin paying off his past due\ndebts or that his finances have improved so as to avoid more financial problems in the\nfuture. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on\n7\nApplicant\u2019s finances and truthfulness shows he has failed to address satisfactorily the\ngovernment\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.t - 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.

His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 14, 1997, Applicant completed and certified a security clearance \napplication (SF-86). On May 30, 2006, he completed and certified an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 9, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 8, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant provided two answers to the SOR, dated April 24, 2009, and July 20, \n2009. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant requested that his case be determined on the \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on December 11, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 14. By letter dated December 30, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM \nto Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on January 8, 2010. His response \nwas due on February 7, 2010. Applicant did not file any additional information within the \nrequired time period. On March 19, 2010, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, Personal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e) and five allegations of financial delinquency under \nAG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.e.).

He made no changes, corrections, or revisions to the investigator\u2019s \nsummaries. (Item 6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSF-86 in May 1997, Applicant admitted using marijuana twice between December 1995 \nand January 1996. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted marijuana use, with \nvarying frequency, from at least 1990 to at least January 1996 and from at least 1999 to \n2001.2 In about 2001, he stopped smoking marijuana. Since that time, he asserts, he \nhas not used marijuana or any other illegal drug. When he completed his e-QIP in May \n2006, he denied any illegal drug use in the previous seven years. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4 \nat 34; Item 5; Item 6 at 8.)     \n \n \nBetween 1995 and 1999, Applicant and his girlfriend, who later became his wife, \nwere involved in a number of arguments that resulted in physical altercations and \narrests. In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Simple Assault and (2) \nDomestic Violence. In February 1996, he was arrested and charged with simple assault. \nIn October 1996, he was arrested and charged with Simple Assault-Domestic Violence.   \nIn November 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with second degree assault \nand possession of marijuana. Applicant pled guilty to the second degree assault charge, \npaid a fine, and received probation before judgment. The marijuana possession charge \nwas nolle prossed. In July 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with simple \nassault. He was ordered to take an anger management course and the charge was \nnolle prossed. ( Item 6; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n \nSection 23d on the e-QIP that Applicant completed and certified on May 30, \n2006, asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to \nalcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question at Section 23(d), thereby \nfailing to list his arrest and charge of possession of marijuana in November 1997. (Item \n4.) \n \n \nSection 23f on Applicant\u2019s 2006 e-QIP asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, \nc, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was \nalcohol or drug related.)\u201d Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to the question at Section 23f and \nlisted a 2005 charge of driving on an expired license. He failed to list that he was \ncharged in 1999 with Simple Assault, ordered to attend anger management training, \nand the charge was nolle prossed. (Item 4.)  \n \n   \nSection 24a on Applicant\u2019s 2006 e-QIP asks: \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 \nyears, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for \nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, heroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants, (barbiturates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to list that he had used marijuana from at least 1999 to about \n2001. (Item 4.) \n                                            \n2 The record does not specify when Applicant was awarded a security clearance, nor does it specify who \nhis employer was at the time the clearance was granted. I conclude that there is insufficient record \nevidence to find that Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nQuestion 26 on the SF-86 that Applicant completed and certified on May 14, \n1997 asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted \nof any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of \nless than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d  Applicant answered \n\u201cNo.\u201d He failed to list his November 1995 arrest and charge of Simple Assault and \nDomestic Violence; his February 1996 arrest and charge of Simple Assault; and his \nOctober 1996 arrest and charge of Simple Assault-Domestic Violence. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn a signed, sworn statement to an authorized investigator on August 21, 1997, \nApplicant stated that he misread Question 26 and answered \u201cNo\u201d because he thought \nthe question referred only to felony crimes. He denied deliberate falsification of the \nanswer. (Item 7 at 2.)  \n \n \nQuestion 27 on Applicant\u2019s May 14, 1997 SF-86 asks if an Applicant has used \nillegal drugs, to include illegal marijuana, \u201c[s]ince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years. \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d and listed marijuana use twice between December 31, 1995 \nand January 1, 1996. He failed to list that he had used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from at least 1990 to at least January 1996. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn October 2002, Applicant filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court \ndischarged his delinquent debts in October 2002. (Item 10; Item 14.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to meet his financial obligations. The \nSOR alleged at \u00b6 2.b. that Applicant owed a creditor a debt of approximately $433, \nwhich was in collection status and unsatisfied as of January 12, 2009. The SOR alleged \nat \u00b6 2.c. that Applicant owed a municipality a delinquent debt of $205 for unpaid parking \ntickets, and, as of July 18, 2006, the debt had not been satisfied. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 \n2.d. that Applicant owed a creditor $65 on a debt that had not been satisfied as of \nJanuary 12, 2009. Finally, the SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.e. that Applicant owed a creditor \napproximately $9,432 on an account that had not been satisfied as of April 1, 2008. \nApplicant admitted the four debts and provided no information to establish that the debts \nhad been paid or otherwise satisfied. The four debts appear on Applicant\u2019s credit \nbureau reports. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 9; Item 10.) \n \n \nAbout nine years ago, Applicant paid $200 for a series of credit counseling \nclasses that his wife attended. He said the classes did not help him and his wife with \ntheir financial situation. (Item 6 at 5.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed his SF-86 in May 1997 and his e-QIP in \nMay 2006, he failed to provide truthful answers to questions about his drug or alcohol \ncharges or convictions, his arrests for assault and domestic violence, and his marijuana \nuse.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Appellant\u2019s responses to these questions on his 1997 SF-\n86 and his 2006 e-QIP showed he had deliberately falsified material facts by failing to \nadmit and disclose his drug arrest, his arrests for assault and domestic violence, and his \nmarijuana use.  \n  \nThis information raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads as \nfollows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b617(a).     \n \nApplicant did not make good-faith efforts to correct the omissions before being \nconfronted with the facts. In his April 2009 and July 2009 answers to the SOR, he \nadmitted deliberately falsifying his responses to Questions 26 and 27 on his May 1997 \nSF-86.  Moreover, in his answers to the SOR, he also admitted deliberately falsifying his \nresponses to Sections 23d, 23f, and 24 on the e-QIP he signed and certified as true on \nMay 30, 2006.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications are a matter of security concern. I conclude \nthat none of the Guideline E mitigating factors apply to the facts of his case. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. In 2002, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were discharged in a chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, and he was able to resume his financial life with clean slate. However, he \nfell behind again by failing to satisfy several smaller debts and one substantial \ndelinquency. He was unwilling or unable to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient \nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  Finally, security concerns \nrelated to financial delinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n   \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 2002.  His \ndelinquencies are recent and on-going. They have occurred under circumstances that \nare likely to recur.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has been steadily employed since 1995. The record does not support a \nconclusion that his failure to satisfy his creditors is the result of circumstances beyond \nhis control. While Applicant provided financial counseling for his wife several years ago, \nhe does not appear to have sought similar counseling for himself, and he failed to \nprovide documentation that he had made good-faith efforts to satisfy his creditors. His \ndebts remain unresolved. In determining an individual's security worthiness, the \nGovernment cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her \noutstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, \n1999).  I conclude that none of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant deliberately falsified his \nanswers to two security clearance applications that he completed and certified in 1997 \nand 2006. He has failed to satisfy his financial delinquencies, and he provided no \ndocumentation to establish that he has established a plan to do so. He did not approach \nhis creditors, alert them to his financial problems, and attempt to find a responsible \nresolution for paying or settling his debts. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct and financial \ndelinquencies.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.e.:          \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n                                              Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old senior quality assurance analyst employed by a government contractor (Tr. 6, 18, 20). He graduated from high school in 1979, and attended college for about one year (Tr. 6-7; GE 1). He served in the Air Force on active duty for four years and in the reserves for two years (Tr. 7; GE 1). He held a Secret security clearance while on active duty (Tr. 7).

However, he failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. He did not make any payments in 2008 or 2009 \ntowards the debts listed in his statement of reasons (SOR). His clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 29, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86), \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                           \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March \n12, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2009. On April 17, 2009, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on May 19, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17), and \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits. There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-6 \n(Tr. 17). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR and response to the SOR (GEs \n7-9). I received the transcript on May 27, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for all of the SOR \ndebts (GE 9). He also admitted the drug offenses listed in the SOR (GE 9). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior quality assurance analyst employed by a \ngovernment contractor (Tr. 6, 18, 20). He graduated from high school in 1979, and \nattended college for about one year (Tr. 6-7; GE 1). He served in the Air Force on active \nduty for four years and in the reserves for two years (Tr. 7; GE 1). He held a Secret \nsecurity clearance while on active duty (Tr. 7). He was divorced in November 2007 (Tr. \n19). He is considering reconciliation with his former wife (Tr. 36). His three children are \nages eight, 20 and 21 years old (Tr. 19).  \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nAround the period of 1999 to 2000, Applicant purchased a small amount of \ncocaine from a friend (Tr. 22). He used cocaine two or three times (Tr. 22-25, 36-37; \nSOR \u00b6 1.a). During this same time period, his employer conducted a urinalysis test and \nApplicant tested \u201cpositive,\u201d establishing the presence of the cocaine metabolite in his \nurine (Tr. 25; SOR \u00b6 1.b). He said his cocaine use was for a brief period of time, \nperhaps a month (Tr. 25). He completed a drug rehabilitation program, lasting about \nfour to six weeks (Tr. 26). The drug rehabilitation involved counseling, group meetings \nand drug tests (Tr. 26). \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant was arrested for possession of an open container of \nalcohol, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and possession of \nmethamphetamine (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 9). He also used methamphetamine shortly before \nhe began driving on the trip where he was arrested (Tr. 28-31; SOR \u00b6 1.c). It was the \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \nfirst time he ever used methamphetamine (Tr. 38). He had an open can of beer in the \ncar (Tr. 30). He failed a field sobriety test (Tr. 31). He had some methamphetamine on \nhis person (Tr. 32). He was arrested and jailed for about 48 hours (Tr. 32). The charges \nwere dismissed because of procedural issues (Tr. 32-33).  He did not receive drug \ncounseling in specific relation to his methamphetamine use. \n \nApplicant denied that he used illegal drugs on other occasions (Tr. 29, 33-34). He \nasserted his drug use was stress related because he was having problems with his \nmarriage, his daughter and other custody issues (Tr. 34). His daughter had behavioral \nproblems (Tr. 34). He went to stress counseling for his separation and pending divorce, \nwhich also addressed his methamphetamine use (Tr. 35). He did not disclose his \nmethamphetamine use to his employer because he was worried about losing his job (Tr. \n36). He denied that he used illegal drugs after 2006, and offer to submit to random \nurinalysis drug testing (Tr. 55). \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant worked for his current employer from January 1986 to January 1994, \nand from June 2002 to the present (Tr. 20). His current annual salary is $67,000 (Tr. \n21). He does not pay child support for his two oldest children (Tr. 20). He pays $716 \nmonthly support to his former spouse for his eight year old son (Tr. 51).  \n \nApplicant did not make any payments towards the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a ($176), \n2.b ($508), 2.c ($657), 2.d ($218), 2.e ($5,688), 2.f ($1,098), 2.g ($888), 2.h ($700), 2.i \n($400), or 2.j ($600) (Tr. 40). The sources of his SOR debts included three credit cards \n(Tr. 42-45; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, 2.f), two telecommunications accounts (Tr. 40, 45; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a, 2.g), purchase of an air conditioning unit (Tr. 44; SOR \u00b6 2.e), a department store \naccount (Tr. 46-47; SOR \u00b6 2.j), and three jewelry store accounts (Tr. 43-46; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, \n2.h, 2.i). He contacted a debt consolidation company about three weeks before his \nhearing; however, their proposed plan was too expensive (Tr. 40-42). The debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.b ($508) and 2.d ($218) are duplications of each other.  \n \nApplicant made some progress on non-SOR listed debts (Tr. 41). In November \n2008, he made five mortgage payments of $974 each to bring his mortgage into current \nstatus (GE 3). He has subsequently maintained his mortgage in current status (Tr. 41). \nHe also paid a non-SOR listed medical debt for about $100 (Tr. 41). At the time of his \nseparation from his spouse in 2006, she made about $15,000 to $25,000 per year (Tr. \n48). Applicant\u2019s monthly salary is about $5,500, and his monthly deductions total about \n$1,338 (Tr. 48). After paying monthly expenses (including child support), about $820 \nremains (Tr. 48-52). He also provides money to his children (Tr. 52-53). For example he \ngave his eldest daughter $700 in March 2009 (Tr. 53). He has not paid any of his SOR \ncreditors anything in 2008 or 2009 (Tr. 54).   \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \n\n \n \n4 \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).     \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and F (Financial Considerations) \nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);2  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b) and 25(c) apply because Applicant used cocaine in \napproximately 1999 or 2000 and methamphetamine in about October 2006.3 He \n \n2AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n3AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Cocaine and methamphetamine are Schedule II Controlled Substances. See 21 U.S.C \u00a7 \n812(c)II(a)(4) (cocaine), and II(c) (methamphetamine); United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458 (2nd Cir. \n2008) (cocaine); United States v. Wheeler, 535 F.3d 446 (6th Cir. 2008) (methamphetamine). See also \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                            \ndisclosed his methamphetamine use on his security clearance application. He admitted \nhis methamphetamine and cocaine use to an OPM investigator, and at his hearing. He \nused illegal drugs primarily because of stress. He possessed these illegal drugs before \nhe used them. His cocaine use was detected by his employer\u2019s drug test. The other \ndisqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n \nNational \nInstitute \non \nDrug \nAbuse, \n\u201cCommonly \nAbused \nDrugs,\u201d \navailable \nat \nhttp://www.drugabuse.gov/drugpages.html. \n\n \n \n7 \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d4 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s last drug use was in October 2006, about 31 \nmonths prior to his hearing. His overall illegal drug use was relatively brief, and involved \ntwo or three cocaine uses and one methamphetamine use. The absence of evidence of \nmore recent or extensive drug use, his offer to submit to random urinalysis testing, and \nhis promise not to use illegal drugs in the future eliminates doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal drug \nuse.5   \n   \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has disassociated from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts. He has broken or reduced the prevalence of his patterns of drug abuse, and \nhe has changed his own life with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug \nabuse for about 31 months. However, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent \nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. The \ncocaine and methamphetamines were never prescribed for him. Although he did \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n5In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n                                           \nsatisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program after being caught using \ncocaine, he subsequently used methamphetamine. Moreover, he did not provide proof \nof a \u201cfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional\u201d as required in AG \u00b6 \n26(d). \n  \nIn sum, Applicant ended his relatively isolated drug abuse in October 2006, about \n31 months ago.6 His illegal drug use is not recent. The motivations to stop using illegal \ndrugs are evident. He understands the adverse results from drug abuse.7  He promised \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future, and offered to submit to random urinalysis tests to \nverify his abstinence from drug use. Drug involvement security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n \n6The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative \njudge considered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were \nmitigated. ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). Here, Applicant used \ncocaine in 1999/2000 and methamphetamine in October 2006. His repeated abuse of these particular \ndrugs is relevant in the whole person analysis, but individually, as listed in the SOR, the abuse of two \nillegal drugs, cocaine about nine years ago, and methamphetamine about 31 months ago is insufficiently \naggravating to cause denial of his clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008), \nthe Appeal Board explained it is the overall conduct that determines whether a clearance should be \ngranted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), see Whole Person Concept \nat pages 11-12, infra.  \n \n7Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n \n9 \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his \nresponses to DOHA interrogatories, in his OPM interview, in his SOR response and at \nhis hearing. His SOR listed 10 delinquent debts totaling about $10,933. The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.d are duplications of each other, and I find For Applicant with respect \nto the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.d, reducing the delinquent debt total by $218. His financial \ndifficulties began in 2006 and continue today. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) to 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because his financial problems \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur\u201d because of his divorce; however, there is \n\n \n \n10 \n                                           \nsome residual doubt about whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent \nSOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged due in \npart to his marital problems, his daughter\u2019s behavioral problems and stress. He provided \nsupport for his three children. He may have lacked sufficient income to pay some of his \ndebts. He does not receive full credit because many of his SOR debts arose years ago, \nand he has made very little recent progress on their resolution.8  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant understands what he has to do to resolve \nhis delinquent debts without financial counseling. Applicant has taken positive action to \nbring his mortgage to current status. He also makes his car payments and manages to \npay his day-to-day living expenses. There are some positive \u201cindications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has also established some mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed some good faith9 in the resolution of his \nnon-SOR mortgage debt and other non-SOR debts and expenses. However, he was \nunable to resolve his SOR debts. He did not prove that he had agreements or even \nattempted to reach agreements with his SOR creditors to accept minimal payments to \nkeep his SOR debts in current status. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did \nnot dispute any SOR debts.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He did not make any payments on any \nSOR debts in 2008 and 2009, even though most of his SOR debts are less than $1,000 \neach. He has not presented sufficient evidence of attempts to generate payment plans \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n11 \nto resolve his SOR debts. His efforts to resolve his SOR debts are simply inadequate to \nfully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for his support to his \ncountry and his family. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the \nDepartment of Defense, his employer and that he is an honorable person. There were \nno allegations of security violations. He had only one arrest and it did not result in a \nconviction. Applicant is a high school graduate, and has about one year of college. He \nserved on active duty in the Air Force for four years and two years in the reserves. \nStress from marital problems and problems with his daughter contributed to his financial \nwoes and to his poor decisions to use cocaine and methamphetamine. He received \nsome stress-related counseling. His employer provided some drug therapy after cocaine \nwas found in a urine sample he provided in a drug test. He understands how to avoid \nfuture delinquent debts. He paid his mortgage and other expenses of daily living. He is \ncurrent on many of his financial responsibilities. He is motivated to have a successful \ncareer as an employee of a Department of Defense contractor, to pay his delinquent \ndebts and to have his security clearance approved. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. His SOR lists nine, \nvalid delinquent debts totaling about $10,700. His financial difficulties began in 2006 \n\n \n \n12 \nand continue today. He had ample opportunity to contact more of his SOR creditors and \nto make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did not make any \npayments on these nine delinquent debts in 2008 or 2009. He made insufficient \nprogress over the last 16 months to resolve his delinquent debts, even though he had \nsteady employment and ample opportunity to contact his creditors and provide \ndocumentation. He was on clear notice from his OPM interview and receipt of DOHA \ninterrogatories and even more so after he received the SOR that he needed to show \nsubstantial progress in the resolution of his delinquent debts; however, he made \ninsufficient effort to accomplish this security responsibility.      \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the \ngovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK W. HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant replied to the SOR as follows: (1) he admitted 19 delinquent debts for approximately $22,320 and an unpaid judgment for $477; and (2) he admitted two incidents of domestic violence involving his then second wife, which resulted in his arrest in 1996 and 2000. In closing argument, department counsel wisely conceded that the criminal conduct matters were mitigated, and so, those matters need no further discussion herein (Tr. at 77\u201378). Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a high-school graduate who has worked as a warehouse product specialist for the same company since 1999. His gross income for 2008 was about $49,000, and his wife earned about $21,000. He is seeking to retain a security clearance for his employment with a company engaged in defense contracting. Applicant married for the third time in August 2008. His first two marriages ended in divorce. He has fathered six children (two per wife). Currently, there are five children (which includes two stepchildren) living in his household. He is paying court-ordered child support via garnishments for a total of about $760 monthly for two children from his second marriage. He has a child-support arrearage of about $1,100 (Tr. at 65).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 9, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nJuly 15, 2009\n\n2\nhere fall under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline J for criminal\nconduct. \nApplicant replied to the SOR on March 5, 2009. The hearing took place on June\n4, 2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 12, 2009. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant replied to the SOR as follows: (1) he admitted 19 delinquent debts for\napproximately $22,320 and an unpaid judgment for $477; and (2) he admitted two\nincidents of domestic violence involving his then second wife, which resulted in his\narrest in 1996 and 2000. In closing argument, department counsel wisely conceded that\nthe criminal conduct matters were mitigated, and so, those matters need no further\ndiscussion herein (Tr. at 77\u201378). Based on the record evidence as a whole, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a high-school\ngraduate who has worked as a warehouse product specialist for the same company\nsince 1999. His gross income for 2008 was about $49,000, and his wife earned about\n$21,000. He is seeking to retain a security clearance for his employment with a\ncompany engaged in defense contracting. \nApplicant married for the third time in August 2008. His first two marriages ended\nin divorce. He has fathered six children (two per wife). Currently, there are five children\n(which includes two stepchildren) living in his household. He is paying court-ordered\nchild support via garnishments for a total of about $760 monthly for two children from\nhis second marriage. He has a child-support arrearage of about $1,100 (Tr. at 65).\nThe record evidence proves that Applicant has a well-established history of\nfinancial problems. In addition to his admissions to the SOR allegations, two credit\nreports document his history of financial problems (Exhibits 3 and 4). Applicant has not\npaid in full, made payment arrangements, settled, or otherwise resolved any of the 19\ndelinquent debts or the unpaid judgment. \nIn addition to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted that he and his first wife\nsought and obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of indebtedness in 1991 (Exhibit\n5). He attributed the bankruptcy to youth and immaturity (Tr. at 58).  Applicant is also\nindebted to the IRS for past-due taxes. The IRS is garnishing his wages for $200 per\nmonth. Applicant believes he owes taxes for tax year 2008, and he is working on that\nissue.  \nApplicant and his current wife are in the process of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\npetition to address their joint indebtedness (Exhibit A). He retained a bankruptcy\nattorney in June 2008, but was unable to take further action in filing a bankruptcy case\nbecause he could not afford the attorney\u2019s fees. In May 2009, he and his wife found a\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Of note, that figure includes a joint\ndebt of $33,327 that Applicant has with his second ex-wife for property in her\npossession. Also, the working papers contain a budget-analysis summary with a\nnegative cash flow of $1,350 per month (Exhibit A at 10\u201313). Applicant admitted these\nfigures are an accurate reflection of his financial condition (Tr. at 66\u201368).\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his second marriage. Although\ndivorced in 2008, it was preceded by a long separation period. Applicant and his then\nsecond wife separated between 1999 and 2000. This long separation period resulted in\nadditional costs and expenses. Also, Applicant had a brief period of unemployment or\nunderemployment due to a strike during November 2006\u2013January 2007. Otherwise, he\nhas been continuously employed by the same company for the last ten years.   \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.2\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n3\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n4\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n5\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n The nine factors of the whole-person concept are set forth in the Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n4\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access to classified\n12\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems raises security concerns because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The available information is\n17\nmore than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. It also establishes a\npattern of financial irresponsibility. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. MC 1 does not apply because his financial problems are lengthy and\nongoing. His second marriage (the multi-year separation and divorce) no doubt\ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. But MC 2 does not apply because the\nevidence does not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. MC 3\ndoes not apply because his financial problems are ongoing, he has yet to file the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and it is far too soon to conclude that his financial\nproblems are being resolved or under control. MC 4 does not apply because the\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n18\n6\nevidence, to include the pending Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, does not establish a good-\nfaith effort to address his delinquent debts. And neither MC 5 nor MC 6 apply given the\nfacts and circumstances here.  \nI considered this case in light of the whole-person concept  and it does not\n18\nsupport a favorable decision. At this time, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are\noverwhelming. He is in the middle of financial turmoil. It will be some time before he will\nbe able to put his financial house in good order and then establish a track record of\nfinancial responsibility. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.t:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 25, 2008; answered it on\nthe same day; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on September 9, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September\n16, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 16, 2008.

He has been employed as an information\nspecialist with a defense contractor since October 2005. He is regarded by his employer\nas a valuable asset to the company. Applicant may be involved in certain projects that\nrequire a security clearance (AX A).\nApplicant was born in Israel and moved to the United States (U.S) when he was\nnine months old (Tr. 11). He graduated from high school in 1993. He graduated from\ncollege in 2000. After college, he worked in his area of expertise. He completed his\nMaster\u2019s degree in 2005 (Tr. 29). \nApplicant\u2019s parents are divorced and living in the U.S. His father is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen. His mother was born in the U.S. They were married in Israel. Applicant has\none brother (Tr. 34). While growing up in the U.S., Applicant visited Israel with his\nparents on a few occasions (Tr. 40). \nApplicant\u2019s extended family from his father\u2019s side (an aunt and cousins) live in\nIsrael. Applicant\u2019s cousins are citizens and residents of Israel. (Tr. 35).  He has little or\nno communication with them. He visited with them on past trips to Israel for\napproximately one hour (Tr. 36).\nIn 2003, Applicant studied in Israel for a period of approximately three months.\nThe program involved American students who wanted to learn more about their religion.\nIn 2004, Applicant attended the short program again (Tr. 38). This program is funded by\nphilanthropists.\nIn March 2005, Applicant married. His wife was born in Israel to American\nparents. Her parents emigrated to Israel and returned to the U.S. after a few years. She\n\n3\nhas extended family in Israel. Her grandparents are there and she communicates with\nthem a few times a year. Her grandfather has a private importing business (Tr. 37). \nAfter his marriage, Applicant visited Israel with his wife. They stayed with his\nwife\u2019s grandparents and also in hotels in the country. The visit was a wedding trip (10\ndays) and an opportunity to visit his wife\u2019s grandparents (Tr. 38).  \nIn December 2007, Applicant told a security investigator he maintained dual\ncitizenship because it makes it easier to travel to and from Israel. At that time, he had a\nvalid Israeli passport that would expire in May 2016. Applicant used that passport when\nhe traveled to Israel. He explained that due to Israeli law he had a passport so that he\ncould enter and exit the country in previous times (AE A). He had renewed his passport\nin 2006 so that he could travel with his wife.\nIn September 2008, Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport to the Israeli\nConsulate to be invalidated (AE B). He wrote to the consulate and initiated the process\nof formal renunciation of his Israeli citizenship. The passport is stamped \u201ccancelled.\u201d\nApplicant was candid and straightforward at the hearing. He has no plans to visit\nIsrael and if he does it will be on a U.S. passport. He has no property in Israel. He has\nnever voted in an Israeli election nor has he served in their military (Tr. 47). \nApplicant\u2019s manager praised Applicant for his exemplary work. He hired Applicant\nas an intern in 2002 and has known him for several years. Applicant has a very strong\nwork ethic, and holds himself to a high standard and takes responsibility for his duties.\nApplicant\u2019s manager traveled with Applicant for work and conferences and attested to his\nloyalty. He recommends him for a security clearance without reservation (Tr. 24). \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Israel.  Israel is a\n1\nparliamentary democracy with a diversified, technologically advanced economy. Almost\nhalf of Israel\u2019s exports are high technology, including electronic and biomedical\nequipment. The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Israel has been identified as a\nmajor practitioner of industrial espionage against U.S. companies. Israel generally\nrespects the rights of its citizens. When human rights violations have occurred, they have\ninvolved Palestinian detainees or Arab-Israelis. Terrorist suicide bombings are a\ncontinuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens are advised to be cautious. The U.S. and\nIsrael have close cultural, historic, and political ties. They participate in joint military\nplanning and training, and have collaborated on military research and weapons\ndevelopment. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security has been a cornerstone of U.S. Middle\nEast policy since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.\n\n4\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n\n5\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s extended family members are citizens and residents\nof Israel. (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relatives in Israel are U.S. citizens\n(\u00b6 2.b). Finally, it alleges Applicant traveled to lsrael to study in 2003, 2004, and 2006 (\u00b6\n2.c).  The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat creates a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Finally, a security concern\nmay be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d). Applicant\u2019s wife was born\nin Israel of American parents, and she has family in Israel. Applicant\u2019s extended family\nlives in Israel and they are citizens of Israel. Based on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b),\nand (d) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the\n\n6\nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to\nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8\u00a9 \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has contacts with extended family members living in\nIsrael and through his wife to her family in Israel so that these two mitigating conditions\ncannot be fully applied.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d All members of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family are U.S. citizens and live in the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b).Applicant\nhas lived in the U.S. his entire life. He received his education in the U.S. He has visited\nIsrael a few times in his lifetime. He has his family and property in the U.S. His career is\nin the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing showed his willingness to sever his ties\nto Israel. As such, his testimony supported this mitigating condition. \n\n7\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant, born a U.S. citizen, has dual citizenship with Israel (\u00b6\n1.a), possessed an Israeli passport in June 2006 that would expire in May 2016 (\u00b6 2.b),\nused his Israeli passport for travel to Israel (\u00b6 2.c), and applied for an Israeli passport in\n2006 even though he was a U.S. citizen by reason of birth in the U.S.(\u00b6 2.d). The\nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in\nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then\nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d  \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security\nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17,\n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but\nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).\nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to\n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant possessed an\nIsraeli passport prior to the hearing and traveled to Israel on that passport. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1)\nis not established because Applicant surrendered the passport in September 2008.\nThus, Applicant does not have a \u201ccurrent foreign passport.\u201d    \nNevertheless, the record established, as noted above, that Applicant exercised his\nIsraeli citizenship by using his Israeli passport on numerous occasions. The disqualifying\ncondition under AG \u00b6 10(a) is raised, even though none of the illustrative examples are\napplicable. The burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the\nfacts.  Several mitigating conditions are potentially relevant.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n11(a).  This mitigating condition does not apply in this case.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant has written\nto the consulate and initiated the process of renouncing his dual citizenship. His\ntestimony was sincere and credible on this issue. AG \u00b6 11(e) \u201cthe passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise is invalidated\u201d\napplies because the passport was surrendered or invalidated by the Consulate.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n8\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in\nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment.\nThere are significant factors supporting the approval of Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Applicant is a mature, well-educated, and very intelligent adult. He\nloves his family and is proud of his culture and heritage. He is a U.S. citizen who\nreceived his education in the U.S. and lived his entire life in the U.S. his employment and\ninvestments are in the U.S.`  He has a longstanding loyalty to the U.S. Although his\nspouse was born in Israel, his immediate family lives in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens.\nHis employer praises Applicant for his diligence and dedication. Israel is a longtime U.S.\nally. I do not believe he is a threat to the United States, but rather an honest, hard-\nworking young man.\nApplicant was born in Israel and was a dual citizen by birth. He had an Israeli\npassport which he used when traveled to Israel in 2003, 2004 and 2006. However, he\nhas surrendered the passport and it is invalid. He has initiated the process of renouncing\nhis Israeli citizenship. He has mitigated the foreign preference security concerns by his\nrecent actions.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and\nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign\npreference. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 51-year-old manufacturing engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant married in February 1981, and divorced his wife in December 2000 over irreconcilable differences (see xs. 1 and 2). He has two adult children from this marriage: ages 27 and 23 (exs. 1 and 2; Tr. 53-54). He has been employed by his current defense contractor for over 30 years and has held a clearance since 1983 (Tr. 54). In November 2005, Applicant made Internet contact with a woman who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan (Tr. 55, 58-59). They subsequently established a romantic relationship and exchanged visits (Tr. 55-56). Her parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. So, too, her brother and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan. None of her family members ever worked for Taiwan government, and none have any working or social relationships with any members of the Taiwan military or intelligence establishments (Tr. 58). When asked, Applicant acknowledged that his girlfriend visited him in December 2005, in May 2006, and in February 2007 (Tr. 59-60). In turn, Applicant made visits to Taiwan to see her in January 2007, April 2007, December 2007, and finally in J (see ex. 1; Tr. 56-57, 61).

The\ncase was assigned to me on August 4, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2009. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including himself)\nand eight exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 22, 2009.  Based\nNovember 30, 2009\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access\nclassified information is granted.\nRulings on Proecedure\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of nine\ndocuments: Background Note: Taiwan, U.S. Department of State (September 2008);\nTaiwan: Taiwan, Specific Information, U.S. Department of State (November 2009);\nRecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service,\nLibrary of Congress (August 5, 2008); Intelligence Threat Handbook (Unclassified/For\nOfficial Use Only), Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); Annual Report\nto Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage 2000, National\nCounterintelligence Center: Annual Report to Congress on foreign Economic Collection\nand Industrial Espionage 2005, National Counterintelligence Executive-2007 (September\n2008); Press Release, California Exporter Fined in connection with Attempted Taiwan\nExport (September 1999); Press Release, Commerce Department Imposes Civil Penalty\non Minnesota Firm in Settlement of Export Violations, U.S. Department of Commerce\n(December 2001); Press Release, Connecticut Company Settles Charges Concerning\nPump Exports to China, U.S. Department of Commerce ((July 2003); Press Release,\nEmcore Corporation Settles Charges of Export Control Violations, U.S. Department of\nCommerce (January 2004); Press Release, Parker Hannafin Corp.

Case No.1:05CR543, (ED\nVA December 2005).  \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 12, 2006). Administrative notice is\nappropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein,\nAdministrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown,\nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named background reports\naddressing the geopolitical situation in Taiwan.  Administrative notice was extended to\nthe documents themselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.\nThis notice did not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the\ninformation contained in the reports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, the allegations against Applicant, are as follows: (a) he has a\ngirlfriend who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan; (b) his girlfriend has a brother and a\nsister-in-law who are citizens and residents of Taiwan: (c) he met his girlfriend on the\nInternet in November 2005; (d) his girlfriend visited him in the U.S. in December 2005, in\n\n3\nMay 2006, in February 2007, and in July 2007; and (e) he visited his girlfriend in Taiwan\nJanuary 2007, April 2007, and December 2007. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. He provided\nno explanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old manufacturing engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant married in February 1981, and divorced his wife in December 2000 over\nirreconcilable differences (see xs. 1 and 2). He has two adult children from this marriage:\nages 27 and 23 (exs. 1 and 2; Tr. 53-54).  He has been employed by his current defense\ncontractor for over 30 years and has held a clearance since 1983 (Tr. 54).  \nIn November 2005, Applicant made Internet contact with a woman who is a citizen\nand resident of Taiwan (Tr. 55, 58-59). They subsequently established a romantic\nrelationship and exchanged visits (Tr. 55-56). Her parents are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan.  So, too, her brother and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nNone of her family members ever worked for Taiwan government, and none have any\nworking or social relationships with any members of the Taiwan military or intelligence\nestablishments (Tr. 58).  \nWhen asked, Applicant acknowledged that his girlfriend visited him in December\n2005, in May 2006, and in February 2007 (Tr. 59-60).  In turn, Applicant made visits to\nTaiwan to see her in January 2007, April 2007, December 2007, and finally in J (see ex.\n1; Tr. 56-57, 61). \nBy June 2009, Applicant had become increasingly concerned that relationship\ncould cause a security problem for him (Tr. 62-63). He insisted that she come to his\nhome in the U.S. to discuss terminating their relationship (Tr. 70-71).  His girlfriend came\nto see him in July 2009, as agreed.  When she arrived, they talked for some time and\nagreed to end their relationship (Tr.71). Applicant shared his decision to terminate his\nrelationship with his Taiwanese girlfriend with his supervisor (Tr. 14-15). Applicant\u2019s\nassurances that he has terminated his relationship with his Taiwanese girlfriend and\nsevered all ties with her are credible and accepted. \nSince ending his relationship with his Taiwanese girlfriend, Applicant has\nexchanged several e-mails with her and talked with her a couple of times by telephone\n(Tr. 64, 69-70). After she returned to Taiwan in July 2009, she telephoned him to let him\nknow she was ok (Tr. 65-67).  And in August 2009, Applicant called his ex-girlfriend to\ncheck on her safety following reports of a typhoon striking Taiwan (Tr. 66).  Applicant has\n\n4\nno current relationship with her and no residual feelings of affection for her (Tr. 66-68).\nApplicant has no reason to believe he will ever resume his relationship with his ex-\ngirlfriend (Tr. 71).\nTaiwan\u2019s country status\nTaiwan has a rich history that dates back 12 to 15 thousand years.  Dutch and\nSpanish colonists claimed the island in the 16  and 17  centuries (see Background Note:\nth\nth\nTaiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007)).  Migration from the Chinese mainland\nover time supplanted the  aborigines peoples of Taiwan. Japan exerted considerable\ninfluence over Taiwan following China\u2019s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule.  Civil\nwar erupted soon after the reversion between Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s KMT government and\nthe increasingly influential Chinese Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong.  When the\ncivil war ended in 1949, two million refugees (predominantly nationalists) fled to Taiwan,\nwhere Chiang Kai-Shek established a separate provisional KMT capital in Taipei (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3). Mao\u2019s victorious Communist party, in turn,\nestablished the People\u2019 s Republic of China (PRC).\nFor the past one-half century, Taiwan has demonstrated steady economic\ndevelopment and today is a major international trading power.  Its accession to the WTO\nin 2002 represented a significant achievement and strengthened its standing in the\nexpanding global economy. \nTaiwan has exhibited steady political development as well since its establishment\nas an island government. Changes reflect a continuing liberalizing process that\nculminated in the tightly contested election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000 (see Background\nNote: Taiwan, supra, at 6).   Chen\u2019s DPP party won major parliamentary victories in 2000\nand again in 2004, enabling Chen to become the first opposition party candidate to win\nthe presidency.  Chen was re-elected in 2004 on a platform that included a \u201cdefensive\nreferendum\u201d (Background Note: Taiwan, supra). Such referenda have been historically\nperceived to be closely linked to the question of Taiwan\u2019s independence.\nTaiwan\u2019s political system is now a multi-party democracy under a Constitutional\numbrella comprising five branches: executive, legislative, judicial, control, and\nexamination.  By all accounts, Taiwan has a good human rights record and has\ndemonstrated respect for the rule of contract in its commercial relations.\nTaiwan\u2019s PRC relations\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is\nonly \u201cone China\u201d (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 7).  Despite differences over\nthe PRC\u2019s one China policy, Taiwan and the PRC have enjoyed increased contacts over\nthe past decade. With Taiwan\u2019s continued relaxation of its PRC policy regarding\n\n5\nunofficial contacts, cross-Strait interactions have grown significantly.  Efforts by the PRC,\nhowever, to resume cross-Strait dialogue without any preconditions have been\nhampered by the PRC\u2019s insistence that the two sides first reach consensus that there is\nonly \u201cone China\u201d before restarting talks (see id. 9-10).\n During  his two terms, Chen has recognized the PRC\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d insistence,\nbut to date has declined to condone the concept.  With both sides unwilling to\ncompromise on this obstacle, they have cautiously progressed with smaller intermediary\nsteps like cross-Strait cargo and passenger charter flights, sale of Taiwan agricultural\nproducts in the PRC, and PRC tourists visiting Taiwan (see Background Note: Taiwan,\nsupra, at 7).  \nThe PRC operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the MSS\n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only], Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), at 71 (June 2004)). The MSS maintains active intelligence\ngathering operations in Taiwan (see id., at 72). These operations use clandestine agents\nto collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC. These consortia are\nsuspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, supra, at 72). \nIn the current political environment, it is still too early to predict the direction of\ncross-Strait negotiations between Taiwan and the PRC. Because of the PRC\u2019s long\ninsistence on Taiwan\u2019s acceptance of the \u201cone China\u201d principle as a requisite to any jump-\nstarting of negotiations over practical agreements in trade, cultural exchanges, and other\nareas of mutual interest, future relations between the two sides remain cloudy at best.\nU.S.-Taiwan relations\nIn a joint communique with the PRC in January 1979, the U.S. announced its\nrecognition of the government of the PRC as the sole government of China and that there\nis but one China, of which Taiwan is a part (see Background Note, Taiwan, supra, at 9).\nThe Joint Communique stated that within this context the people of the U.S. will maintain\ncultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.\nTo implement the Joint Communique, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act\n(TRA) in April 1979.  President Carter, in turn, signed the legislation into law on April 10,\n1979.  Besides providing the legal basis for maintaining the U.S. unofficial relationship\nwith Taiwan, the TRA reinforced the U.S. commitment to providing defense assistance to\nTaiwan. The TRA expressly provides for the continued sale of appropriate defensive\nmilitary equipment to Taiwan and declares that peace and stability in the area are in U.S.\ninterests (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 10). And even though the U.S.\nterminated its Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan following its de-recognition of the latter,\nit has continued its sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan (see id.).\n\n6\nWhile ambiguously written, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security against\ncross-Strait aggression by the PRC\u2019s military forces is implicit in the TRA\u2019s coverage of\nU.S. responsibilities towards Taiwan. This implicit construction is oft-used to support\nproponents of a \u201ctwo China\u201d policy.  To be sure, initial actions of the Bush Administration\nin 2001 provided cause to conclude the new President had abandoned longstanding U.S.\npolicy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in favor of a policy that placed a clearer emphasis on\nTaiwan\u2019s interests at the expense of the PRC (see Taiwan: Recent Developments and\nU.S. Policy Choices, supra, at 11-12). More recent developments, though, reflect the\nsmoothing of U.S.-PRC relations as a part of the broader war on terrorism.  \nCurrently, the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral\nsteps by either side to alter the status quo (see Background Note; Taiwan, supra, at 10).\nFor so long as Taiwan\u2019s national security remains under threat (both veiled and unveiled)\nfrom the PRC, Taiwan can be expected to pursue the development of its military amidst\nexpectations of military assistance from the U.S.\nStressing self-reliance, Taiwan maintains a large military establishment\n(accounting for 15.3 per cent of its central budget).  Its principal mission is to defend itself\nagainst the PRC, which has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 9).  With its unchanged public policy of maintaining\n\u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in its official relations with Taiwan, the U.S. can be expected to\ncontinue its support of Taiwan\u2019s island security with the sale of defensive military\nequipment.\nTaiwan\u2019s economic collection practices\nBased on past reports to Congress, Taiwan is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  In its most recent reports to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, the preparers list\nTaiwan as well as the PRC among the most active collectors based on cited surveys (see\n2000 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage, supra, at 4-6; Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\nand Industrial Espionage-2007, supra, at 5). Specific incidents are cited in the NACIC\nReport that identify offenders of proprietary information thefts and attempts to acquire\nexport-restricted products (see 2000 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage, supra, at 2-6).\nRecent espionage convictions document ongoing collection activities covering theft\nof sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan companies (see, e.g., Press\nRelease, California Exporter Fined in Connection with Attempted Taiwan Export, supra;\nPress Release, Commerce Department Imposes Civil Penalty on Minnesota Firm in\nSettlement of Export Violations, supra; Press Release, Connecticut Company Settles\nCharges Concerning Pump Exports to China, supra; Press Release, Emcore Corporation\nSettles Charges of Export Control Violations, supra; Press Release, Parker Hannafin\nCorp. Settles Charges Pertaining to Illegal Exports to Taiwan and China, supra; Press\nRelease, Defendants Indicted on Charges of Conspiracy to Export Controlled Items,\n\n7\nsupra; Superceding Indictment, United States v. Ching Kan Wang and Robin Chang,\nsupra; Press Release, Statement of Facts (stipulated), United States v. Keyser, Crim.\nCase No.1:05CR543, (ED VA December 2005), supra). Multilateral export control\nregimes in place are voluntary and not universally adhered to by member nations.\nStress points between Taiwan, the PRC and the U.S.\nIn its annual report to Congress in 2008, the NCC described the PRC as a country\nintent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge developed by multiples of collection\nagents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by espionage (see Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage-2007, supra, at 5).\nThe PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire sensitive technology poses a considerable\nchallenge to U.S. counterintelligence measures.\n Recent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight the\nPRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. Violating its own 2004 U.S.-China agreement, the PRC\noft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use items licensed for export\nto the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral in scope\n(see Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage-2007, supra, at 4-6). Multilateral export controls and arms embargoes,\nhowever, do  provide additional insurance against altering the cross-Strait military balance\nthat has been long maintained (see id.).\nWithout effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be expected to\nacquire dual use technologies with military potential from the U.S. and Taiwan through the\nU.S. and other source countries.  Reported intelligence, though, is lacking on any Taiwan\nuse of its collection resources in the U.S. to supply the PRC with needed military\ntechnology (alone or through technology with known dual use capabilities).\nOther stress points between the PRC and Taiwan are reflected in periodic PRC\nmilitary exercises in the Taiwan Straits (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 9).  More\nfrequent U.S.-PRC high-level exchanges have the potential to reduce cross-Strait military\ntensions (id.).  \nCross-Straight dialogue between the PRC and Taiwan remained suspended during\nChen\u2019s two terms.  Still, economic and social ties continued to develop during Chen\u2019s\npresidency (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 7).  Following his election in 2008,\nMa Ying-jeou has moved earnestly to resume cross-Straight dialogue, expand charter\nflights, and initiate new efforts to improve cross-Straight relations (id.). The U.S. officially\nwelcomes these initiatives as a process that can hopefully contribute to the reduction of\ntensions in the region and creation of environmental conditions conducive to the peaceful\nresolution of differences between Taiwan and the PRC.  For U.S. policy, Ma\u2019s election\noffers opportunities for improved cross-Strait relations, but also policy challenges to the\ndurability, and efficacy of the Taiwan Relations Act in light of projected changes in the\ncross-Strait relationship between Taiwan and the PRC (see Taiwan: Recent\nDevelopments and U.S. Policy Choices, supra, at 4-5, 13).\n\n8\nFor the foreseeable future, Ma\u2019s effectiveness in reducing cross-Straight tensions\nis likely to be tested by the recent corruption conviction of Chen. What implications this\nconviction has for Taiwan\u2019s domestic and cross-Straight relations is unclear at this point\n(Tr. 72-74). Any fundamental changes in cross-Straight relations can, of course, be\nexpected to affect Taiwan\u2019s relations with the U.S. \nEndorsements\nApplicant\u2019s coworkers, daughter, and friends who have known Applicant for a\nnumber of years attest to his honesty and trustworthiness (see ex. A; Tr. 14-16).  Two of\nhis co-workers express awareness of his past relationship with a Taiwanese citizen; both\nconsider him to be reliable and trustworthy and worthy of holding a security clearance\n(see ex. A; Tr. 15).\nApplicant\u2019s daughter finds her father to be completely trustworthy (Tr. 44).  She\ndescribed his judgment to be good at all times (Tr. 44).  His daughter acknowledged her\nawareness of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Taiwanese girlfriend and accepted her\nfather\u2019s assurances that he had terminated the relationship (Tr. 45).\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for the past three years rate him as a\nsuccessful contributor who meets the objectives and expectations of his position (see ex.\nB).  He is characterized as a valued team player who has the necessary abilities and\nmotivational skills to effectively carry out his assigned responsibilities (ex. B). \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding\nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The\nguidelines do not require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in\naccordance with AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) of\nthe revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n\n9\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\nguideline is pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative judges\nto make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on\nthe relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial proceedings, the\njudge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial evidence\nany controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\n\n10\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth.  Security issues of concern to the Government\nfocus on a former girlfriend of Applicant\u2019s who, along with her parents, brother, and sister-\nin-law, are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Taiwan is a country that has been historically\nfriendly to the U.S., albeit, one with a reported history of economic collection activities in\nthe U.S.\nBecause of the status of Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend and family members in Taiwan,\nconcerns were raised that his ex-girlfriend and her family members residing in Taiwan\nmight be subject to undue foreign influence by Taiwanese government authorities to\naccess classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Due to their relationship\nwith Taiwan, his ex-girlfriend and her immediate and extended family members presented\nsome potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d\nof the AGs for foreign influence apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nNone of the family members connected to Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend have any prior\nmilitary service. As a result, no consideration of DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is\nwarranted.\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s  ex-\ngirlfriend\u2019s family residing in Taiwan have any political affiliations with Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment, have any known history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations about his discontinued relationship with his Taiwanese girlfriend, and\nindirectly her family members, any risk of undue foreign influence on Applicant and his ex-\ngirlfriend and her family members would appear to be insubstantial, and clearly not of the\n\n11\nmagnitude that could make them subject to a heightened security risk of pressure or\ncompromise under Guideline B.\nTaiwan, although a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and\nproprietary interests in the past, enjoys a special relationship with the U.S. through the\nTRA, and is a democratic government with a history of respect for human rights and the\nrule of law.  While Taiwan has been a reported active collector of economic intelligence in\nthe U.S., it has not been known to use acquired information to harm U.S. strategic\ninterests.  Taiwan remains a member in good standing with the WTO, and a constructive\ntrading partner with the U.S., who at times has itself been targeted by agents of the PRC\nfor intelligence collection on Western groups thought to be promoting democracy and\nengaging in anti-communist activities directed at the PRC.\nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate\nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, applicable guidelines are available to evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s situation in light of the supplied materials and country information about\nTaiwan. \nThe special relationship that has existed between the U.S. and Taiwan over the\npast half-century has been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and economic\ninterests. Reports of Taiwan intelligence gathering against U.S. companies are\ncounterbalanced by Taiwan\u2019s history of friendship and partnership in a defense pact\nformalized in 1979.  The mutually supportive bonds that have linked Taiwan\u2019s special\nrelationship with the U.S. have not been weakened by either the TRA, or the  geopolitical\nforces that have shaped the U.S.\u2019s evolving relationship with the PRC.  Whatever potential\nheightened security risks arise as the result of Applicant's having family members with\ncitizenship and residency in Taiwan are by every reasonable measure mitigated.  \nTaiwan remains a friend of the U.S. and is a country whose democratic institutions\nare not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of\nlaw.  Unlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take account of the covered\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk.  The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime\ninvolved do matter. Taiwan, while reported to target the U.S. and its companies in the past\nfor economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no known recent history of\nhostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence against family members to\nobtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary data. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's ex-girlfriend\nand her family members in Taiwan, any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or\nundue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or\n\n12\neconomic or proprietary data out of Applicant through his ex-girlfriend and her family\nmembers residing in Taiwan is an acceptable one.  Applicant, accordingly, may take\nadvantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or\nactivities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nMC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or\nthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest\u201d has direct application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Both at home and in his work,\nApplicant has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S.\nfor his entire life. \nWhatever potential conflicts Applicant may have had while in a romantic relationship\nwith his ex-girlfriend (a Taiwanese citizen with family in Taiwan) have since been abated\nby the severance of their relationship.  Moreover, any heightened risk that might have\nbeen imputed to Applicant due to his Taiwanese relationship have been more than\ncounterbalanced by his demonstrated U.S. citizenship commitments and responsibilities.  \nEvaluating Applicant\u2019s security worthiness in the context of a whole person\nassessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to any hypothetical conflict of\ninterests with his ex-girlfriend and her family who still reside in Taiwan. Applicant is highly\nregarded and trusted by his daughter, his supervisors, and his co-workers, and is not\naware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of her family members\nmight be exposed to. \nUnder the recounted circumstances presented, any likelihood of any coercion,\npressure, or influence being brought to bear on him as the result of his prior relationship\nwith a Taiwanese citizen and resident, and her family members, would appear to be\nminimal at this time. Put another way, Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest with\nTaiwan citizen/residents or property interests in Taiwan that could be at risk to exploitation\nor compromise by Taiwan military or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members\nin Taiwan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's\nability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s familial\nrelationships in Taiwan.

Roberts, Esquire\nJuly 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn February 9, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 22,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 2, 2009, in La Vegas, Nevada.\nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A\nthrough T, which were also admitted without objection. Five additional witnesses\ntestified on behalf of Applicant. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\n\n2\nJune 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and his\nwitnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 50 years old. He is not currently married, and he has one child and\none stepchild.  He served in the United States Air Force from 1976 to 1980, when he\nreceived an Honorable Discharge. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists six allegations (1.a. through 1.f.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts. Applicant testified that all the\noverdue debts listed on the SOR were incurred, without his knowledge or permission,\nby a woman, who was his girlfriend at the time the debts were incurred. He first learned\nof these debts in 2007. The conduct of his former girlfriend will be discussed in greater\ndetail below. \nThe debts will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $15,022.\nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred when his girlfriend wrote two checks of\n$7,500 each against one of Applicant\u2019s credit cards, without his knowledge.\nApplicant testified that he has resolved this debt. Exhibit E, a letter from the\ncreditor of this debt, dated April 28, 2009, establishes that Applicant negotiated a\nsettlement of this debt in the amount of $7,250, which has been paid by Applicant. I find\nthat this debt has been resolved. \n1.b. This second overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,293. \nApplicant testified that he has resolved this debt. Exhibit F, a letter from the\ncreditor of this debt, dated April 29, 2009, establishes that Applicant settled this debt on\nApril 27, 2009. I find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.c. This  overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,351. \nApplicant testified that he has resolved this debt. Exhibit G, a letter from the\ncreditor of this debt, dated April 15, 2009, establishes that Applicant settled this debt on\nMarch 27, 2009. I find that this debt has been resolved. \n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,041.\nApplicant testified that this debt is the same as that listed on 1.c., above. Exhibits 3 and 5\nestablish that this is the same debt as 1.c., and as reviewed above, it has been resolved.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $65.\nApplicant testified that this debt is for a book club, which he did not believe he ever\njoined. However, Applicant testified that he has resolved this debt. Exhibit I, a letter from\nthe creditor of this debt, dated February 12, 2009, establishes that Applicant settled this\ndebt. I find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,880.\nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred when his girlfriend charged $10,000\nagainst one of Applicant\u2019s credit cards, without his knowledge.\nApplicant testified that he has resolved this debt. Exhibit J, a letter from the\ncreditor of this debt, dated May 26, 2009, establishes that Applicant settled this debt on\nApril 28, 2009. I find that this debt has been resolved.\n \nIn addition to the debts listed on the SOR and discussed above, Applicant testified\nthat he had three other credit card debts, and in 2007, he withdrew approximately\n$33,000 from his 401(k) to resolve these three debts. \nAs briefly reviewed above, Applicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred\nbecause of the acts of his former girlfriend. He estimated that she incurred approximately\n$100,000 of debt without his knowledge, to help her pay for a very problematic gambling\nhabit. It is his understanding and belief that he has now resolved all of the overdue debt.\nThe girlfriend\u2019s acts included writing checks on Applicant\u2019s credit cards without his\nknowledge, withdrawing money from Applicant\u2019s checking account, and failing to apply\nApplicant\u2019s money to pay their bills. Since she was the one who paid the bills, and she\nalso got the mail most days, he did not learn about her actions until he was contacted by\na creditor, who told Applicant that he had not received payments for a vehicle that\nApplicant  had purchased, and he was preparing to repossess the vehicle.\nApplicant and his former girlfriend owned a home together, in which they lived.\nExhibit T is a Quitclaim Deed that the girlfriend signed, deeding the property to Applicant\non June 1, 2009, for his payment to her of $2,500. At the time of the hearing, she was in\nthe process of moving out of the home. The only financial tie he continues to have with\nher is a vehicle that they purchased as cosigners, and for which she is required to make\nthe payments. If she defaults on this loan he is prepared to resolve this debt. \nAt this point, Applicant has no credit cards, and he is current on all of his debts.\nExhibit D includes a current Personal Financial Disclosure Form which shows that\nApplicant has a net reminder of $592 a month. \n\n4\nMitigation\nApplicant had five witnesses testify on his behalf. He also submitted nine\ncharacter letters (Exhibit K through S), some of which were from the witnesses who\ntestified. All of these individuals were very positive and laudatory in their descriptions of\nApplicant as \u201cextremely security conscious, painfully honest, trustworthy,\u201d and \u201cfiscally\nresponsible.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay most of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, Applicant\nargued that his financial problems were primarily the result of the fraudulent action of his\ngirlfriend, who acted in such a manner to seriously damage his credit, without giving him\nany reason to suspect her actions.  Since he became aware of the serious financial\npredicament in which she placed him, he has acted quite responsibly to resolve all of\nthese overdue debts.  Therefore, I find that this mitigating condition is a significant factor\nfor consideration in this case. I also find (d) is a mitigating condition since Applicant has\nmade a good-faith effort and now resolved all of his overdue debts. \n Applicant has now resolved all of his very significant overdue debt. I conclude\nthat he has mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 \u00a9, the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Mitigating Conditions apply, along with the extremely positive testimony\nfrom the witnesses for Applicant, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant  questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n          Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\n          In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H.

Applicant is divorced. He has five children, ranging in age from 9 to 19 years old. His credit rating is \u201cpoor to fair.\u201d Although Applicant has not received credit 2 counseling, he states he is working to improve his credit rating and satisfy his debts.3 The SOR sets forth 10 allegations. Each allegation represents a delinquent debt identified either in Applicant\u2019s answers to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2008, a credit report dated May 30, 2008, or a credit report dated October 5, 2007. In responding to 4 the SOR, Applicant only responded to the allegations by writing either \u201cI deny\u201d or \u201cI admit\u201d with no further elaboration. In his Interrogatories, Applicant maintained that he disputed the nine delinquent debts cited in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i. He produced no documentary evidence to substantiate this claim. Those allegations represent approximately $30,800 in delinquent debt. The credit reports dated April 28, 2009, and May 30, 2008, however, indicate that Applicant disputed the two delinquent accounts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6 1.b (approximately $411) and \u00b6 1.c (approximately $857).

On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security\nconcerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nIn a response notarized on December 18, 2008, Applicant admitted one of the\nnine allegations set forth in the SOR. He declined to request a hearing on the record in\nhis response. When contacted by DOHA regarding whether he wished to have a\nAugust 19, 2009\n\n Item 2, Transmittal Letter and Receipts at 9 (Memorandum for the Record, dated Mar. 31, 2009).\n      1\nDepartment Counsel later requested Applicant to submit a written request for an administrative determination,\nbut no additional materials were forthcoming. FORM at 2, footnote 2.\n Item 6, Interrogatories, at 4.\n      2\n Id.\n      3\n See Items 5-6 (Interrogatories), Item 8 (May 2008 credit report), and Item 9 (Oct. 2007 credit report),\n      4\nrespectively.\n See Items 7-8 (Apr. 2009 and May 2008 credit reports), respectively.\n      5\n2\nhearing, Applicant stated he preferred an administrative determination.  Department\n1\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated April 28, 2009, that\nincluded nine attached items. Applicant received the FORM on May 8, 2009. He did not\nrespond to the FORM within the 30 days provided. On August 4, 2009, the Director,\nDOHA, forwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge for administrative\ndetermination. I was assigned the case on that same day. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding\nthe security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old senior technician. He has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since 2003. He has a post-secondary degree in electronic\nengineering. Applicant is divorced. He has five children, ranging in age from 9 to 19\nyears old. His credit rating is \u201cpoor to fair.\u201d  Although Applicant has not received credit\n2\ncounseling, he states he is working to improve his credit rating and satisfy his debts.3\nThe SOR sets forth 10 allegations. Each allegation represents a delinquent debt\nidentified either in Applicant\u2019s answers to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2008, a credit\nreport dated May 30, 2008, or a credit report dated October 5, 2007.  In responding to\n4\nthe SOR, Applicant only responded to the allegations by writing either \u201cI deny\u201d or \u201cI\nadmit\u201d with no further elaboration. \nIn his Interrogatories, Applicant maintained that he disputed the nine delinquent\ndebts cited in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i. He produced no documentary evidence to\nsubstantiate this claim. Those allegations represent approximately $30,800 in\ndelinquent debt. The credit reports dated April 28, 2009, and May 30, 2008, however,\nindicate that Applicant disputed the two delinquent accounts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\n1.b (approximately $411) and \u00b6 1.c (approximately $857).  Applicant admitted to\n5\nallegation \u00b6 1.j (approximately $1,123), regarding a child support arrearage, in his SOR\nresponse.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      6\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      8\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nAn administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number\nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe U. S. Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n6\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n7\n8\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the U.S. Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The U.S.\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\n\n Id.\n      9\n Id.\n      10\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      11\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      12\n4\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n9\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The\n10\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It is\n11\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.12\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant admitted he has a delinquent debt of over $1,100 involving child\nsupport. As for the remainder of the delinquent debts at issue, although the record\nshows two of those nine accounts were formally disputed, Applicant failed to show he\ndisputed any of the other credit report entries. Those entries represent almost $30,000\nin delinquent debt. Such facts are sufficient to raise security concerns under financial\nconsiderations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).\nWith such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case\nagainst him and mitigate security concerns. \nIn relying on an administrative determination after failing to provide documentary\nevidence or more information, Applicant presented insufficient facts to review his\nfinances in light of the allegations. Moreover, there are insufficient facts to determine\nwhat led Applicant to become delinquent on any debt and no corroborating evidence\nshowing how or whether he tried to dispute the alleged debts. Consequently, neither\nfinancial considerations mitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior\n\n5\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nFurther, Applicant has not received financial counseling and there is little evidence he\nhas worked toward honoring his debts or disputing the majority of delinquent accounts\nnoted on his credit reports, obviating the applicability of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) and FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d). The only evidence of Applicant-initiated efforts toward correcting his\ncredit report is regarding SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.c, amounting to about $1,270 of\nalleged debt which Applicant disputes. No other FC MCs apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, educated man. In requesting an administrative\ndetermination, however, he chose to carry his burden regarding the allegations by\npresenting unelaborated facts and no supporting documentation. Applicant\u2019s best\nadvocate regarding his claim that he disputed nine of the 10 accounts at issue is\nDepartment Counsel, whose FORM includes documentary evidence that two of the\nmore minor debts at issue were formally disputed. Otherwise, there is no corroborating\n\n6\ndocumentation showing that the other accounts Applicant denies were formally\ndisputed and no indication as to whether any progress has been made on his child\nsupport arrearage. Consequently, the 10 alleged delinquent debts at issue remain\nunrefuted. In light of the fact that the ultimate burden is on Applicant, financial\nconsiderations security concerns remain unmitigated. Therefore, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

(GE 1 at 16-17, 26, 35-36; AR at\n6; AE J; Tr. at 6-7, 43, 47.)\nAfter leaving Army service, Applicant worked in several retail management jobs,\nthe most recent of which paid him more than $100,000 per year. He was fired from that\njob in August 2006 for going out to lunch in violation of the company policy that required\nat least one manager to be present in the store while it was open for business. He did\nnot obtain new employment until October 2007, when he was hired into his present job\npaying $47,500. Between jobs he drew unemployment compensation and his retired\npay, but this combination was insufficient to prevent depletion of his savings and he\nbegan incurring delinquent debts. (GE 1 at 11-12; GE 4 at 5; AR at 3; Tr. at 37-39.)\nThe $51 delinquent telephone bill, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, was incorrectly reported\non Applicant\u2019s January 7, 2008, credit bureau report (CBR) that was obtained by the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator. Applicant explained this during his\nOPM interview on January 25, 2008, and contacted the credit bureau thereafter to have\nit removed. This dispute was successful, and the debt does not appear on any of his\n\n3\nmore recent CBRs. This was the only SOR-listed debt that Applicant denied in his\nresponse to the SOR. (GE 2 at 18; GE 3; GE 4 at 7-8; GE 5; GE 6; AR at 2; Tr. at 49-\n55.)\nApplicant admitted that the remaining SOR-listed delinquent debts, totaling\n$49,088, were his and remained unpaid as of October 2008. These 12 debts involved\nloans and credit cards, with balances ranging from $183 to $10,754. They all became\ndelinquent between February and October 2007, and most did so during April or May of\nthat year. (GE 4; GE 5; AR at 1-2.)\nApplicant entered a debt settlement and debt negotiation service agreement with\na law firm in January 2009. This arrangement required Applicant to make two initial\nmonthly payments of $921, followed by 38 monthly payments of $531. The law firm\nundertook to attempt to negotiate settlement agreements with the creditors holding ten\nof his delinquent debts totaling $37,200. The 40-month estimate for resolution of the\ndebts is based on a forecast average settlement-agreement rate of 40% of the original\ndebt amounts. Applicant thought all his delinquent debts were included, but the two\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k were inadvertently omitted. After his hearing, he\nmodified the agreement to include the \u00b6 1.h debt ($10,754), and paid \u00b6 1.k debt ($183)\nhimself. The plan modification increased his remaining 34 monthly payments to $699. In\nMay 2009, the law firm negotiated a resolution and settled the SOR \u00b6 1.e debt ($925)\nfor a payment of $379.  (AR at 3, 7-12; AE H; AE I; AE M; AE O; Tr. at 28-31, 36, 44-47,\n49, 56-60.)\nThe remaining ten SOR-listed debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f through 1.j, and 1.l)\nhad risen to a total reported delinquent amount of $49,548 by June 19, 2009. (GE 6.)\nThe debt plan now calls for Applicant to make $27,743 in total payments to the law firm,\nof which $8,701 pays fees to the law firm and $19,042 is available for funding debt\nsettlements. (AE O.) Applicant submitted a personal financial statement showing\ndifferent monthly expenses than those appearing on the budget generated in connection\nwith his debt settlement agreement, but both showed a monthly net surplus of about\n$400. (AE J; AR at 11.) He is current on all debt payments except those described\nabove, including his first and second mortgage loans and his auto loan. (GE 6 at 4.) \nA supervisor from the Army Depot for which Applicant provides support\nsubmitted a letter attesting to his strong character, integrity, and honesty, and\ndescribing him as loyal, helpful, and intelligent. (AE A.) His May 2009 performance\ncounseling form reported his outstanding work quality, cooperation, and dependability.\n(AE B.) Applicant did not demonstrate a full understanding of his financial situation\nduring his hearing. However, his testimony and demeanor were forthright and credible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\n\n4\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 16, 62.) From February to October 2007,\nApplicant accumulated multiple delinquent debts that totaled more than $49,000. He\nsuccessfully disputed one minor SOR-listed debt, paid a second one shortly after his\nhearing, and entered into an agreement with a law firm to attempt resolution of the\nremaining debts for less than half the amount due. One debt has been settled under this\nagreement to date, and it will require three more years to complete, even under the\noptimistic assumption that all creditors will cooperate. Applicant\u2019s present financial\ninability to pay ten substantial remaining delinquencies, still totaling more than $49,000,\nsupports ongoing security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He is under continuing financial\nduress, so he remains at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The\nevidence further established a two-year history of not meeting some significant financial\nobligations, raising security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). This history potentially indicates\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nthereby raising questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nthe foregoing financial considerations. The potentially applicable mitigating conditions\nare:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\n6\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6 20(a) was not established because Applicant\u2019s many delinquencies arose\nwithin the last few years and most continue at present. They resulted from his failure to\nreduce expenditures during a 14-month period of unemployment after he was fired for\nunreliable and untrustworthy behavior as a store manager. While loss of employment is\npotentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(b), his job loss was the direct result of his\nirresponsible conduct, and drawing unemployment compensation for 14 months before\ngoing back to work while spending on credit did not constitute responsible action\nthereafter. Substantial delinquencies continue to date. His only demonstrated means\navailable to resolve them is a three-year plan, conditioned on his creditors accepting\nsettlements averaging 40% of what they are due, while the lawyers\u2019 fees consume 32%\nof his total program payments. This program involves some financial and legal\ncounseling and Applicant intends for it to lead to resolution of his outstanding debt.\nHowever, it has yielded minimal results so far, with no substantial basis to conclude it\nwill succeed going forward. Only the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.k have actually\nbeen resolved, and more than $49,000 in delinquent debts remain outstanding. While\nthese are steps in the right direction, meaningful mitigation is not yet established under\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or (d). Applicant successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m,\nproviding mitigation for that $51 delinquency under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern was incurring 12 delinquent debts, which totaled more than $49,000\nwhen the SOR was issued. (The 13  SOR-alleged debt was not his, and he\nth\nsuccessfully disputed it with the credit bureaus.) By the time the record closed, one\n$925 debt had been resolved through his debt settlement plan and he paid one $183\ndebt directly to the creditor. However, the remaining ten delinquent debts still totaled\nmore than $49,000, due to continuing interest and fee charges. Although his 14-month\nperiod of unemployment ended in October 2007, he did nothing to address or resolve\nany of these debts until January 2009. His actions since that time have begun to\naddress the resulting security concerns, but he has not yet established a good-faith\ntrack record of financial responsibility or permanent behavioral changes. The record\ndemonstrates his ongoing inability to address the majority of his delinquent debt, except\nthrough a plan contingent on the creditors accepting 40% of what they are due and\nrequiring almost three more years to complete. Applicant\u2019s ongoing insolvency\ngenerates continuing potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. He exhibited an\nincomplete understanding of his financial situation and failed to demonstrate that his\nfinancial problems are unlikely to continue or worsen, at least for the next several years.\nApplicant has a long record of excellent and honorable service to the national\ndefense, and is highly regarded by those with whom he now serves. On balance,\nhowever, he presented insufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns arising from\nhis history of failing to meet financial obligations, and his inability to pay his substantial\ndelinquent debts. The record generates significant doubt as to his present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On November 19, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 26, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Henry Lazzaro denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n1\u201cApplicant had been interviewed and hired by his present employer at the time of his last reported use of\nmarijuana and was aware he would have to apply for a public trust position.\u201d  Decision at 3.  The Board also notes record\nevidence that, at the time of Applicant\u2019s last use, he had already taken a pre-employment drug test.  Tr. at 33.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (\u201cAs a matter of common sense, one would expect that a person who\nhad taken a drug test as a condition of employment would understand the importance of future abstention.\u201d)\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a manager of billing\nand enrollment for a defense contractor.  He began using marijuana while in college.  From early\n1993 until about December 1996, he smoked marijuana approximately two or three times a week.\nHe also admitted to using marijuana infrequently from 1996 until 2007.  He stated that, during that\ntime, there were \u201csome years\u201d in which he did not use marijuana at all.  Decision at 2.  \u201cIn the\nQuestionnaire for Public Trust Positions Applicant executed on November 16, 2007, he admitted\nhe used marijuana four times between November 2006 and November 2007.\u201d  Id.  His last reported\nuse of marijuana occurred at his going-away party from his previous employer.  During the party\nhe went outside with band members and shared a joint they were passing around.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he had used marijuana four times\nfrom November 2006 to November 2007.  He stated that, rather, he had taken three to five hits from\na marijuana cigarette on one occasion in November 2007.  Applicant contends that this purported\nerror impaired the Judge\u2019s analysis and resulted in an erroneous decision.  The Board has considered\nthis argument in light of the record evidence.  The Board concludes that the challenged finding is\nsupported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d).  Even if the Judge had made findings\nconsistent with Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, however, there is little likelihood that the Judge\nwould have decided the case differently, given the totality of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-23829 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007) (\u201c[E]ven if these two challenged observations had\nnot been included in the Judge\u2019s decision, it is not reasonably likely that the outcome of the case\nwould be different.\u201d). \nIn holding that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, the\nJudge noted matters which Applicant submitted in his own behalf, including a letter of reference\nattesting to his trustworthiness and a letter for his employer in which Applicant renounces the future\nillegal use of controlled substances.  However, the Judge also considered,  inter alia, evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred after he had been hired for a job requiring a\ntrustworthiness designation.1  He also considered Applicant\u2019s age at the time of his last use (32) and\nthat this use occurred despite his having been a long-time employee of his previous place of work.\nThe Board concludes that the Judge has \u201carticulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,\nincluding a rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his ultimate adverse decision.  See\nADP Case No. 06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007).

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on December 15, 2008. He\ndenied both SOR allegations and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 5, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non March 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 23, 2009. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled. The government submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 26, 2009\n\n2\nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AE) 1 and admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to provide\nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. Two\ndocuments were timely received, marked as AE 2 & 3 and admitted into the record without\nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was marked as Appellate\nExhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included in the file. The transcript was received on May 4, 2009.\nProcedural Matters\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR subparagraph 1.b.\nThat motion was allowed without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 34 years old. He has been employed as a manager of billing and\nenrollment by a defense contractor since November 2007. He was employed by a\nmanufacturing company outside the defense industry from April 1998 until November 2007.\nHis last position with that company was as a supervisor. \nApplicant attended college from 1992-97, but did not obtain a degree until 2002\nbecause of an administrative issue at the college he attended. He completed his studies\nat a junior college after he was married and had begun full-time employment. He received\na bachelor degree in economics in 2002. He was awarded a master\u2019s degree in industrial\nengineering in August 2006.\nApplicant has been married since February 1996. He has three children, ages nine,\nsix and two. Applicant has known his wife since middle school and they began dating while\nin college.\nApplicant began using marijuana while in college. From early 1993 until about\nDecember 1996, he smoked marijuana about two to three times a week. However, there\nwere also weeks during his college years when he did not smoke marijuana at all.\nApplicant sometimes purchased marijuana and at other times used marijuana that had\nbeen provided by friends.\nApplicant was interviewed on April 16, 2008, at which time he stated he used\nmarijuana once a month to once every other month from 1996 until 2007. However, he also\nstated there were some years during which he did not use marijuana at all. He testified his\nuse of marijuana from the time he left college until his last reported use in November 2007\nwas sporadic and infrequent. He again asserted that several years would pass by during\nwhich he totally abstained from using marijuana. In the Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions Applicant executed on November 16, 2007, he admitted he used marijuana four\ntimes between November 2006 and November 2007.  \n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n2\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n3\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n4\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n5\n3\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana occurred in social settings. He used marijuana with co-\nworkers from his previous employer even though he was a supervisor. He denies he ever\nused marijuana with his subordinates. Applicant\u2019s last reported use of marijuana occurred\nat his going-away party from his last employer. He held the party at his in-laws house and\nhired a band to entertain. During the party, he went outside with the band members and\nshared in a joint they were passing around. Applicant had been interviewed and hired by\nhis present employer at the time of his last reported use of marijuana and was aware he\nwould have to apply for a public trust position. \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a friend with whom he\npreviously smoked marijuana. That friend has known Applicant since they attended college\ntogether. He attests that Applicant is a trustworthy individual as best exemplified by the fact\nthat the friend had selected Applicant and his wife to serve as guardians of his two children\nif necessary. Applicant also submitted a copy of a letter he sent to his employer renouncing\nthe future illegal use of controlled substances and acknowledging that future use would be\ngrounds for revocation of his trustworthiness entitlement and termination of his\nemployment. His employer acknowledged receipt of the letter. \n  \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n2\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.3\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n4\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.5\nAn administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The administrative judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\n\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n6\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n4\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.6\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n7\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\ndepartment counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n8\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drugs\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant illegally used and purchased marijuana on a regular basis between 1993\nand 1997 while he attended college. He continued to use marijuana on a less frequent\nbasis after college until his last reported use in November 2007. Between November 2006\nand November 2007, Applicant used marijuana four times. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n25(a): any drug abuse; and DC 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase . .\n. apply.\nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred about 18 months ago. However, that use\noccurred after he had been hired for a position of trustworthiness and while he was aware\nhe would have to apply for a trustworthiness determination. His use of marijuana after\ncollege included using the illegal drug with co-workers while he was employed in a\nsupervisory position. His last use of marijuana occurred with members of a band he had\nhired to play at his going away party from work as he was about to commence work in a\ntrustworthiness position. In the preceding year, he used marijuana on four occasions\ndespite being married, the father of three young children, and employed in a long-term and\nvery responsible job. Applicant\u2019s admitted repeated abuse of marijuana between 2006 and\n2007 under these circumstances was a gross display of lack of judgment. Accordingly, I\nfind Mitigating Conditions (MC) 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago . . . or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 26(b): a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs\nwere used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; . . . do not apply. \n\n5\nApplicant submitted a letter to his employer renouncing the future illegal use of any\ncontrolled substance and acknowledging that such use would be grounds for revocation\nof his trustworthiness eligibility and termination of his employment. Accordingly, he is\nentitled to application of MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation. However, considering the circumstances described above about his\ncontinuing use of marijuana after college, I find application of this mitigating condition\ninsufficient to mitigate the security concern caused by Applicant\u2019s long-term use of\nmarijuana through November 2007.\n \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe drug involvement security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Guideline H is decided against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two alcohol-related arrests in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, but contested some of the SOR information in SOR \u00b6 1.a about his history of alcohol consumption (GE 7). He also admitted all of the drug-related SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.e), and disclosed some mitigating information about his illegal drug use.2 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 25 years old and has worked for a government contractor since March 2007 as an electrical engineer (Tr. 98, 119, 120).3 He graduated from high school in June 2001 (Tr. 26, 119). He attended a state university from 2001 to December 2006, and did not live at home (Tr. 27-30, 119-120). He received a bachelor of science with a major in electrical engineering (Tr. 121). In February or March 2007, he returned home to live with his parents (Tr. 30, 37). He moved into an apartment in June 2008 and currently lives with a roommate (Tr. 30-31).

He ended his drug abuse in \nNovember 2005. He had two alcohol-related incidents, the most recent was on January \n26, 2008. Applicant mitigated drug involvement security concerns; however, he failed to \nmitigate security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption because insufficient \ntime has elapsed since his most recent incident. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied at this time. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 23, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (2007 SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE 1)). On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (Drug Involvement) and \nH (Alcohol Consumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn November 20, 2008, Applicant signed his SOR response, and he requested a \nhearing (GE 7). Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 23, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to me that same day. At the hearing held on January 26, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and \nApplicant offered three exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A-C) (Tr. 68, 125-126). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 and AEs A-C (Tr. 19-20, 68, 126). \nAdditionally, after the hearing Applicant provided one more exhibit, which was admitted \nwithout objection (AE D). I also admitted the hearing notice (GE 5), the SOR (GE 6), \nand Applicant\u2019s SOR response (GE 7). I received the transcript on January 29, 2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two alcohol-related arrests in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, but contested some of the SOR information in SOR \u00b6 1.a about his \nhistory of alcohol consumption (GE 7). He also admitted all of the drug-related SOR \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.e), and disclosed some mitigating information about his \nillegal drug use.2 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old and has worked for a government contractor since \nMarch 2007 as an electrical engineer (Tr. 98, 119, 120).3 He graduated from high \nschool in June 2001 (Tr. 26, 119). He attended a state university from 2001 to \nDecember 2006, and did not live at home (Tr. 27-30, 119-120). He received a bachelor \nof science with a major in electrical engineering (Tr. 121). In February or March 2007, \nhe returned home to live with his parents (Tr. 30, 37). He moved into an apartment in \nJune 2008 and currently lives with a roommate (Tr. 30-31). He has never been married \nand does not have any children. \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. His response to SOR (GE 7) is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise. \n \n2Department counsel made a motion to amend SOR \u00b6 2.b to conform with Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse, as to the date Applicant\u2019s drug use terminated. Applicant did not object, and I granted the \nmotion (Tr. 15-16). I made the change to SOR \u00b6 2.b and initialed the change (GE 6).  \n \n3Applicant\u2019s 2007 SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIllegal Drug Use4 \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana about 25 times from about May 2000 to November \n2005 (Tr. 135, 137-138; SOR \u00b6 1.a), cocaine about five times from about March 2004 to \nAugust 2005 (Tr. 136, 138-139; SOR \u00b6 1.b), opium twice from about July 2003 to fall of \n2004 (Tr. 136, 139; SOR \u00b6 1.c), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) once in \nabout October 2002 (Tr. 137, 139; SOR \u00b6 1.d), and psilocybin (mushrooms) once in \nDecember 2001 (Tr. 137, 139; SOR \u00b6 1.e). He used illegal drugs primarily because he \nwas curious about the effects of the drugs (Tr. 143-144). Most of the times when he \nused illegal drugs, he did not consume alcohol in combination with the illegal drugs (Tr. \n144-145).   \n \nApplicant disclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application (Tr. \n99). He has not used any illegal drugs since November 2005 (Tr. 99, 152). He continues \nto associate with his friends who used illegal drugs in college (Tr. 140). In May of 2008, \nmany of his drug-using friends and Applicant attended a wedding (Tr. 141). Applicant \nwas unable to provide the frequency or recency of his contacts with his drug-using \nfriends from college (Tr. 143). The person who gave Applicant the mushrooms is \ncurrently located in the same city where Applicant currently lives, and Applicant \ncontinues to associate with him (Tr. 156). He has never received counseling for drug \nabuse (Tr. 145). He does not intend to ever use illegal drugs again (Tr. 152). After the \ngovernment contractor hired Applicant, he has not been tested for illegal drug use (Tr. \n156).   \n \nApplicant signed a statement, agreeing that his clearance could be automatically \nrevoked for any illegal drug use, and reiterated that he will not use any illegal drugs  in \nthe future (AE D). \n  \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related incidents (Tr. 131). The first was in February \n2007 and the later one was in January 2008. He last consumed alcohol on March 11, \n2008 (Tr. 131). He did not remember passing out from excessive alcohol consumption \n(Tr. 132). On multiple occasions, he consumed so much alcohol that he had a blackout \nand could not recall what occurred while he was drinking alcohol (Tr. 132). \n   \nIn February 2007, while Applicant was at university, he damaged the parking \nmachine that accepts tokens (Tr. 32, 123-124). The campus police arrested Applicant \nand held him overnight (Tr. 32). The court required him to perform eight hours of \ncommunity service and placed him on unsupervised probation for one year (Tr. 121). He \nhad to inform authorities if he left the state, or had another incident (Tr. 124). He paid \n$1,300 in restitution for the property damage (Tr. 121). He was released from probation \nin November or December 2007 (Tr. 124). After this incident, he decreased his alcohol \nconsumption, and stopped drinking alcohol during the week (Tr. 114). However, on the \n \n4 The sources for the facts in this section are the SOR (GE 6) and Applicant\u2019s SOR response (GE \n7), unless otherwise stated.  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nweekends, every once in awhile, he would \u201ccut loose\u201d (Tr. 115).  On June 4, 2007, an \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant (GE 3 at 4-\n8). Applicant described his outpatient alcohol counseling to the OPM investigator that he \nreceived after the February 2007 incident (GE 3 at 7). Applicant advised the OPM \ninvestigator, \u201cSince subject\u2019s treatment, subject has minimal use of alcohol, limiting it to \none glass of beer/wine with dinner, one time per week\u201d GE 3 at 7).  \n \nOn January 26, 2008, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated by \nalcohol (DuI) first offense and refusal to submit to a blood or breath-alcohol test (GE 7). \nHe left a bar about 2:00 am, and arrived at his vehicle at about 3:45 am (Tr. 155). He \nrefused the breath-alcohol test the police offered because he wanted to consult an \nattorney before submission to the test (Tr. 154). He did not think he was drunk when the \npolice pulled him over (Tr. 155). He pleaded guilty to DuI first offense and his refusal to \nsubmit to a blood or breath-alcohol test was nolle prosequi (Tr. 122; GE 2 at 2; GE 7). \nThe court sentenced him to 30 days incarceration (suspended), one year suspended \nlicense and a $300 fine (Tr. 102; GE 2 at 1; GE 7). His lawyer cost $2,500 (Tr. 113). \nThe license suspension was converted to a restricted license (GE 2 at 1). The \nrestrictions remain in effect from June 18, 2008, until March 9, 2009 (Tr. 123; GE 2 at \n1).  \n \nThe court ordered Applicant to attend 10 weeks of alcohol and safety action \nprogram (ASAP) (Tr. 102). The ASAP cost $400 or $450 (Tr. 102, 113). ASAP involves \nclasses with about 30 other persons, most also have DuIs (Tr. 103). Each ASAP \nmeeting included a breathalyzer test to determine whether there was any detectible \nalcohol use (Tr. 132-133). Applicant did not test positive for alcohol consumption on any \nof the ASAP breathalyzer tests (Tr. 134). He learned about the adverse effects of \nalcohol on the body and mind, as well as the legal and employment problems that result \nfrom alcohol abuse (Tr. 104). He learned about the terrible effects of drunk driving on \ndefendants and victims and their families (Tr. 104-105). He signed ASAP\u2019s agreement, \nwhich required him to abstain from alcohol consumption for one year (Tr. 103).  \n \nThe court required Applicant to attend one Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting \nper week for 16 weeks (Tr. 103, 109). After completing the AA sessions, he did not want \nto continue with the AA meetings because he thought some AA attendees became \nemotionally or socially dependent on AA (Tr. 109). He did not make it to the first step of \nthe 12-step AA program (Tr. 154). Some AA attendees focus their social lives on AA \nmeetings, and he did not need AA to resist alcohol consumption (Tr. 110). He preferred \nto attend classes or hear lecturers discuss the problems from alcohol consumption and \nto attend group counseling sessions (Tr. 111).   \n \nApplicant is required to attend group counseling with an outside medical \nprofessional for 16 weeks (Tr. 103, 109). He attends group counseling, which involves \ndiscussion between about nine people who have had similar experiences with alcohol \n(Tr. 108). Applicant is required to pay the cost for a licensed professional counselor (H) \nwith a M.S. degree. H provided three, one-on-one counseling sessions to date (Tr. 103, \n129-130). These sessions with H cost over $100 per hour (Tr. 128). He meets with H \nonce a month, and most recently met with him in January 2009 (Tr. 129). H did not use \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \na breathalyzer test to check for alcohol use (Tr. 133). H evaluated Applicant and \ndetermined he met the criteria for \u201cAlcohol Abuse, 305.00, according [to] the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, version IV-TR (DSM-IV-\nTR)\u201d (AE C). H noted the February 2007 and January 2008, alcohol-related incidents, \nand described Applicant\u2019s therapeutic efforts; however, he concluded Applicants past \ndrug use was not relevant and did not mention Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption to the \ndegree to cause blackouts (AE C).  H concluded Applicant had a good prognosis and \ndid not \u201cpresent a safety risk for a security clearance\u201d (AE C).       \n \nApplicant recognized that consumption of even a small amount of alcohol can \nhave adverse effects on a person\u2019s driving (Tr. 105). Applicant found that abstaining \nfrom alcohol consumption was not difficult for him (Tr. 106). After March 2008, he \noriented himself towards a more healthy lifestyle (Tr. 113). He runs and lifts weights and \ncan now run 10 miles with no problem (Tr. 114). He feels fantastic (Tr. 114). He is more \ngoal oriented, and ambitious (Tr. 115-116). He wants to continue his education and \nmake other mental and educational self-improvements (Tr. 116-117).      \n \nApplicant was very upset and sorry about the 2008 DuI arrest (Tr. 100). He knew \nhis parents were very disappointed about his conduct (Tr. 100). The day after the police \nreleased him, he informed his supervisor and then his security officer of the 2008 DuI \n(Tr. 101). Because his family and employer are aware of his DuI, there is no possibility \nof extortion (Tr. 117). He described himself as honest, loyal, candid, trustworthy, and \nreliable (Tr. 117-119). He believed he has learned from his mistakes and would make \ncorrect decisions in the future (Tr. 118). After his probation ends in March 2009, he \nplans to engage in limited, responsible consumption of alcohol (Tr. 157). He would not \ndrink any alcohol before driving (Tr. 157). If the choice was between alcohol \nconsumption and his employment, he would permanently abstain from alcohol \nconsumption (Tr. 158). \n  \nEvidence of Lifestyle and Character \n \nApplicant\u2019s roommate has known Applicant since they were freshman together in \nhigh school (Tr. 85). They did not attend the same college (Tr. 94). He is Applicant\u2019s \nclosest friend (Tr. 85). They have shared an apartment since June 14, 2008 (Tr. 85). He \nhas alcohol in their apartment (Tr. 95). Prior to March 2008, he worried about \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption (Tr. 86). He has observed Applicant \nintoxicated by alcohol, most recently around December 2006 (Tr. 90). In 2008, he and \nApplicant were at locations where alcohol was served or present and Applicant \nabstained from all alcohol consumption (Tr. 86, 91). Since December 2006, he has not \nseen Applicant consume illegal drugs (Tr. 86). After March 2008, Applicant has had a \nhealthier lifestyle and extensively exercised and watched his diet (Tr. 87). Applicant is \nvery disappointed in himself about the adverse effects of his alcohol abuse, and he \nrecognized the necessity for lifestyle changes (Tr. 93-94). Applicant is the most \ntrustworthy person he knows and should have a security clearance (Tr. 88).   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father (F) has two bachelors degrees, and is employed by the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) (Tr. 25). F has 29 years of federal employment (Tr. 25). F \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsupervises a significant number of DoD employees with sensitive duties involving \nclassified materials (Tr. 48-49, 53-54). Over his years of federal employment, F has held \nsecret and top secret clearances (Tr. 25). Applicant told F about both incidents involving \nalcohol. In January 2008, Applicant called F from jail, when he was arrested for DuI (Tr. \n32-33). F thought Applicant drank too much alcohol on about six occasions before \nJanuary 2008 (Tr. 33-36). F attended tailgate parties at Applicant\u2019s state university after \nfootball games and observed many students consume excessive alcohol (Tr. 33-34). \nApplicant reduced his alcohol consumption after he began to work for the contractor \nbecause of the increased responsibility and the necessity to get up early in the morning \nfor work (Tr. 37-38). F was not aware of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use until 2008, when it \nbecame an issue for Applicant\u2019s security clearance (Tr. 38-40). Applicant has been \naround others consuming alcohol at weddings and at his parents\u2019 residence when \nalcohol was available (Tr. 45-48). Despite the availability of alcohol, Applicant did not \nconsume any alcohol (Tr. 45-48). F was adamant that Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption \nstopped on March 12, 2008 (Tr. 45-48). Applicant has changed since January 2008 (Tr. \n47-48). Applicant has lost 50 pounds and is in great physical shape (Tr. 48). F is well \naware of the requirements for holding a security clearance and believes Applicant is \nsufficiently trustworthy and reliable to hold a clearance (Tr. 50-51). Applicant \nunderstands the consequences of future alcohol or drug-related problems and he is \nconfident Applicant will not have future problems (Tr. 51-53).  \n  \nA senior engineering manager (M) was Applicant\u2019s original hiring manager in \nMarch 2007, and supervised him for the next two years (Tr. 56-57, 75). Applicant told M \nabout his 2007 alcohol-related arrest, and in January 2008 Applicant told M about his \nDuI almost immediately after the police arrested him (Tr. 58, 65). Applicant\u2019s on-duty \nwork performance was not affected by Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol (Tr. 67). \nApplicant demonstrated initiative, ambition and drive, establishing himself as an \nexceptional employee (Tr. 61, 68, 69; AE A, B). For example, he made several \nimpressive design reviews for customers that were superior to presentations made by \nmuch more senior employees (Tr. 73). As a result of Applicant\u2019s diligence, he received a \nlarger-than-average pay raise of six percent, and a promotion (Tr. 63, 69, 70). Applicant \nmade valuable contributions to the Air Force and his employer (Tr. 63-64, 66-67). After \nthe January 2008 DuI, Applicant went on a health and physical fitness program (Tr. 68). \nM discussed Applicant\u2019s situation and performance with higher management and \nsecurity, and they determined that Applicant should receive the company\u2019s support (Tr. \n71-72). M considered Applicant to be honest, loyal, trustworthy and dedicated to the \nUnited States (Tr. 60, 65, 73). Applicant has learned from his mistakes and can be \ntrusted with a security clearance (Tr. 74, 82-83).  If his clearance is revoked, it will affect \nthe scope of duties; however, the company does not intend to immediately terminate his \nemployment (Tr. 81-83).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines G (Drug Involvement) and H (Alcohol Consumption) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f) and 22(g) do not apply. He did not consume \nalcohol at work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption problem was not diagnosed or evaluated by a qualified medical \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or by a licensed \nclinical social worker. (The government did not establish that Mr. H is a licensed clinical \nsocial worker, or other explicitly listed medical professional.) Although he received \nalcohol counseling in 2007, he did not receive the benefits of a significant alcohol \ntreatment program. The alcohol counseling he received in 2007 was too superficial to \napply AG \u00b6 22(f).  He did not violate any court orders.  \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related incidents. In February 2007, he damaged \ncollege property while intoxicated, and in January 2008, he drove while intoxicated by \nalcohol. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Currently, he does not habitually consume or engage in \nbinge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. However, when he was \nin college he did consume sufficient alcohol to have a blackout. Such behavior in \ncollege does constitute binge-alcohol consumption. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies.  \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not fully apply. On January 26, 2008, the police arrested \nApplicant for DuI first offense (SOR \u00b6 1.a). On March 10, 2008, the court found \nApplicant guilty of DuI first Offense. This DuI is recent. It is his second alcohol-related \narrest in two years. These two events are relatively frequent and recent. He stopped his \nalcohol consumption as required by his ASAP, and accordingly, he receives some credit \nbecause future alcohol-related offenses are less likely to recur. However, AG \u00b6 23(a) \ncannot be fully applied because he continued to consume alcohol up until March 12, \n2008. He has abstained from alcohol consumption for less than a year, which is not a \nsufficient period of time under all the facts and circumstances.  \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.5  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not fully acknowledge or \ncompletely describe his history of alcohol consumption. He was very reluctant or unable \nto estimate the number of times he became so intoxicated in college that he had \nblackouts. Although he was not diagnosed as being alcohol dependent or being an \nalcoholic, a clearer, a more forthright description of his past alcohol use would have \nhelped to erase lingering concerns. He may be minimizing his alcohol consumption \nproblem, refusing to fully acknowledge the extent of his alcohol consumption \u201cproblem.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.a generally describes his history of alcohol use; however, I specifically find \nApplicant\u2019s clarifications of his history of alcohol use in his SOR response (GE 7) to be \naccurate. Although he completed an alcohol abuse treatment program after his 2008 \nDuI, he stopped attending AA meetings. His history of alcohol problems, his failure to \nfully recognize and acknowledge his history of alcohol abuse, his most recent DuI, and \nhis status as being on probation for his 2008 DuI until March 2009 exclude providing full \nmitigating credit under AG \u00b6 23 at this time.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current alcohol-related therapy is a positive development, showing \nthat he continues to recognize an issue with overcoming his alcohol problems. \nHowever, after carefully consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption,6 I conclude his two alcohol-related incidents in the last two years, and his \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n6For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nDuI seven months after advising an OPM investigator that his alcohol consumption is \nminimal and he limits himself \u201cto one glass of beer/wine with dinner, one time per week\u201d \nGE 3 at 7) are significant factors against mitigating alcohol consumption concerns. His \nprediction that he will return to responsible alcohol consumption, when his probation \nends in March 2009 also raises lesser security concerns in light of the diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse (as opposed to alcohol dependence). \n   \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug7 involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular \ncase: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d8 and \u201cillegal drug possession.\u201d   \n \n \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \n7AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Mushrooms are the street name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule I \nControlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a \nplant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). \nCocaine is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine). Opium is covered under \nSchedules I, II, III, and V as a controlled substance. See Sch. I(b) (listing opium deravatives); Sch. \nII(a)(1)-(3); Sch. III(d)(1), III(d)(3) and III(d)(7); Sch. V(5). See also National Institute on Drug Abuse, \n\u201cCommonly Abused Drugs\u201d, available at www.drugabuse.gov/ DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html (GE 4). \n \n8AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 \nare not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used \nmarijuana about 25 times from about May 2000 to November 2005, cocaine about five \ntimes from about March 2004 to August 2005, opium twice from about July 2003 to the \nfall of 2004, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) once in about October 2002, \nand mushrooms (psilocybin) once in about December 2001. He used illegal drugs \nprimarily because he was curious about the effects of the drugs. He possessed these \nillegal drugs before he used them. \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d9 \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was on November 2005, about 50 months prior to his \nhearing. AG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies. His overall illegal drug use lasted approximately five \nyears (2000 to 2005), and involved numerous uses of illegal drugs such as marijuana, \necstasy, mushrooms, opium and cocaine. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies because his past drug use \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.10 He \nhas abstained from drug use for about 50 months, and he recognizes the adverse \nimpact on his life of drug abuse. These actions create a reasonable certitude that he will \ncontinue to abstain from drug use. I am reasonably confident his illegal drug possession \nand use will not recur. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future and is subject \nto drug testing at his employment, confidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness \nand good judgment with respect to drug use is restored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts because most of them remain in the state where he attended \nuniversity. He continues to associate with some drug users. He has broken his patterns \nof drug abuse, and he has changed his life with respect to illegal drug use. He has \nabstained from drug abuse for about 50 months. He provided \u201ca signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) applies.  \n \n                                            \n9 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n10In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs. The marijuana, cocaine, opium, mushrooms, and ecstasy were never \nprescribed for him. He did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements. \n  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in November 2005, about 50 \nmonths ago. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the \nadverse results from drug abuse.11 He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track \nrecord of no drug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to \nclassified information.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he used illegal drugs from 2000 to 2005. He \nstopped using illegal drugs in 2005. In 2007, he frankly and candidly admitted his \nextensive history of drug use and his 2007 alcohol-related incident on his security \nclearance application. He subsequently admitted his drug use and 2007 alcohol-related \nincident to an OPM investigator. He was candid concerning all derogatory information in \nhis response to DOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. He knows the \nconsequences of drug abuse and excessive alcohol consumption. He completed ASAP, \nattended AA meetings and received one-on-one expert counseling, providing important \nmitigation of alcohol consumption concerns. Applicant significantly contributes to his \ncompany, the Air Force and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work \n \n11Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nof any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would \nintentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance show \nsubstantial responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His company supports his \ncontinued access to classified information. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain \nfrom alcohol and drug use, and avoids future offenses, he will have future potential for \naccess to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with drug abuse for five years. He has not received drug \ncounseling or treatment. However, if his only problem had been his drug abuse, security \nconcerns under the drug involvement guideline would be mitigated by his abstinence \nfrom drug abuse for more than 50 months because of the passage of time and other \nmitigating conditions. His two alcohol-related incidents in 2007 and January 2008 \ncannot be mitigated at this time. His decisions to consume excessive amounts of \nalcohol were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be \nfully responsible for his conduct. These two offenses show a lack of judgment and a \nfailure to abide by the law in the context of security requirements. Such conduct raises a \nserious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption. Drug involvement is mitigated \nbecause it is not recent.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. However, I \nrecommend reinstatement of his clearance in one year if he continues to abstain from \nalcohol consumption, illegal drug use, and other criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                            \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Guideline B - Foreign Influence The Applicant, who was born in the PRC, came to the U.S. in 1991 to pursue his Ph.D. (TR at 24 line 24 to page 27 line 11). He was married before he came to the U.S. (TR at page 27 line 18 to page 29 line 3). He and his wife were both naturalized in August of 2005 (e-QIP at pages 7~8 and 16~17).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 6, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on April 23, 2007.  On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 20, 2008.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on December 24, 2008, and it was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge on January 5, 2009.  I received the case\nassignment on January 20, 2008.  DOHA had issued a notice of hearing on January 5,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 21, 2009.  The Government\n\n2\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.  Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on\nFebruary 3, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February\n4, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On January 31, 2008, he submitted Exhibit A,\nwithout objection. The record closed on February 4, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  The request was\ngranted.  The request, and the attached documents, were not admitted into evidence,\nbut were included in the record.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations of the\nSOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant, who was born in the PRC, came to the U.S. in 1991 to pursue his\nPh.D. (TR at 24 line 24 to page 27 line 11).  He was married before he came to the U.S.\n(TR at page 27 line 18 to page 29 line 3).  He and his wife were both naturalized in\nAugust of 2005 (e-QIP at pages 7~8 and 16~17).  They have children who are native\nborn Americans (TR at page 29 line 4 to page 31 line 6).  The Applicant\u2019s \u201cnet worth [in\nthe U.S.] is probably $600,000 excluding . . . [his] house,\u201d and he owns nothing in the\nPRC (TR at page 32 line 22 to page 36 line 8).\nThe Applicant\u2019s father was a businessman, whose business was taken away\nfrom him when the Communist came to power in 1949 (TR at page 42 line 4 to page 43\nline 1).  As a result, the Applicant has no love or loyalty to the PRC (Id).\n1.a. and 1.d.  The Applicant mother passed away in December of 2008; and as a\nresult, he has little incentive to now visit the PRC (TR at page 17 line 21 to page 18 line\n14, and AppX A at pages 3~7).  He visited the PRC five times since 2000, always\nvisiting and staying with his mother (Id).\n1.b.  The Applicant has three siblings, one older brother and two older sisters,\nwho are citizens and residents of the PRC (TR at page 18 line 15 to page 19 line 19, at\npage 44 lines 1~23, at page 45 lines 18~25, and at page 46 line 10 to page 48 line 20).\n\n3\nThey are all \u201cpeasant farmers,\u201d and his two sisters are \u201cilliterate\u201d (Id).  None of\nApplicant\u2019s siblings have any connection with the government of the PRC, and are not\nmembers of the Communist party (TR at page 18 line 15 to page 19 line 19, at page 44\nlines 1~23, at page 45 lines 18~25, and at page 46 line 10 to page 48 line 20).  The\nApplicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis his siblings and the PRC (Id, and Tr at\npage 50 line 14 to page 51 line 22).\n1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of the PRC (TR at 19 line\n20 to page 21 line 8, and at page 54 line 12 to page 55 line 3).  They are also peasants\n(Id).  Neither of Applicant\u2019s in-laws have any connection with the government of the\nPRC, and are not members of the Communist party (TR at 19 line 20 to page 21 line 8,\nand at page 54 line 12 to page 55 line 3).  The Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-\nvis his in-laws and the PRC (Id, and Tr at page 50 line 14 to page 51 line 22).\nI also take administrative notice of the following facts: The PRC, the most\npopulous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an important trading\npartner of the U.S.  It is run by the Communist Party which controls all aspects of the\nPRC government.  It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.  Although\nthere has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the U.S.\nThe PRC has an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings;\ndetention or incarceration without notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest,\ndetention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of\ndue process; restrictions on free speech, on religious freedom, freedom to travel, on\nfreedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family, home or correspondence.\nThe PRC engages in espionage against the U.S. through an extensive network\nof businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S.\nmilitary technology.  It tries to identify ethnic Chinese in the U.S. who have access to\nsensitive information, and sometimes enlist their cooperation in illegal technology\ninformation transfers.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are citizens of and reside in the PRC.  This is clearly\n\n5\ncountered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . . . are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The Applicant has no\nlove for the PRC.  Since his mother passed away, he has little contact with the PRC.\nFurthermore, he can not be coerced by the PRC.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHe has the unqualified support of his Senior Manager and two colleagues (AppX\nA at pages 8~10, see also at pages 11~15).  His Senior Manager avers, in part, the\nfollowing:\n[The Applicant] . . . was well respected by his co-workers, management\nand his customers.  He has always shown an outstanding work ethic and\nwas essential to the success of the program [a high profile aerospace\nprogram].  He works very well with others and has demonstrated\nexceptional team work skills.  [The Applicant] . . . is a valuable engineering\nasset and I appreciate the time he was able to spend on the . . . program.\nI highly recommend [the Applicant] for a security clearance (AppX A at\npage 8).\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his alleged Foreign Influence. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry\u201d (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram\u201d (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on March 10, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 20, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 14, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing on July 21, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 4, which were received and entered into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and he submitted Exhibit A, which was received without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on August 5, 2009. Based\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. and 1.b., and he denied\n1.c. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is not married. He received a Master\u2019s degree in\n2002, in Urban and Regional Planning.  Applicant works for a defense contractor, and\nhe seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists 3 allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under Adjudicative\nGuideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n1.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency,\nfrom approximately 1985 to at least July 2007.  \nApplicant testified that the dates of his marijuana usage, that are alleged in the\nSOR, are correct. He stopped using marijuana primarily when he transitioned to working\non Department of Defense projects. He conceded that during his usage, he knew using\nmarijuana was illegal. \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1985, when he was in junior high school. He\nindicated that his usage increased and when he was an undergraduate college student,\nhe estimated that he used marijuana once a week (Tr at 37). Applicant further testified \u201cI\nhadn\u2019t really used it that much since graduate school in 2002.\u201d He estimated that from\n2002 until 2007, he used marijuana approximately \u201cevery couple of months, you know,\nkind of at a party type of thing.\u201d (Tr at 23-24).\nApplicant has worked for his current employer for six years, and clearly he used\nmarijuana for four of those years. When he was asked what was his company\u2019s policy\nregarding his drug usage, he stated \u201cThere\u2019s a chance I could be terminated [for drug\nusage].\u201d \n1.b.  The SOR alleges that Applicant purchased marijuana. During his testimony,\nApplicant could not recall much of the specifics regarding his marijuana purchases, but\nhe did estimate that his last purchase of marijuana occurred in 2004 or 2005 (Tr at 25).\n\n3\nUpon cross examination he stated that he started purchasing it, at times with friends,\nand at times alone, when he was in high school (Tr at 36-37).\n1.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant may use marijuana in the future. As\nreviewed above, Applicant denied this allegation in his RSOR. At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he does not intend to use marijuana \u201ccertainly not while I have my security\nclearance.\u201d (Tr at 26). \nWhen asked by Department Counsel whether Applicant would state\nunequivocally that he would never use marijuana again, and \u201cis the potential out there\nfor  [Applicant] to use marijuana in the future?\u201d Applicant replied, \u201dAnything is possible .\n. . I mean, I don\u2019t necessarily think that people can make statements that are that open\nto future events.\u201d (Tr at 42-43).\nFinally, Applicant conceded that during the years of his marijuana usage, he\nmade a decision and did abstain from marijuana usage on two separate periods of time.\nWhen asked why he began using marijuana again after his abstention, he testified\n\u201cWell, you know, you have weaknesses of moments, you know, weak moments. Just\nlike people that are alcoholics, you know, they make a commitment to stop, but\noccasionally they fall off the wagon, as they say.\u201d (Tr at 47).\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a letter from a Vice President of Applicant\u2019s current employer\n(Exhibit A). He wrote, \u201cIn performance of our government projects [Applicant] has\nalways represented the company professionally and his work standards and product\nquality are consistently at the higher standards of our industry.\u201d However, during his\ntestimony, Applicant conceded that this individual knew of his marijuana usage during\ncollege, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t gone into full details of this case with him.\u201d (Tr at 45). Because\nthis individual was unaware that Applicant continued to use marijuana for at least four\nyears while he was employed by his company, I cannot not give much weight to this\nrecommendation. \nApplicant did submit a cover letter as part of Exhibit A in which he wrote, \u201cI\naccept an automatic revocation of clearance for any violation related to future drug use.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and the use of\nmarijuana, and his four years of continued use after he went to work for his current\nemployer, is of great concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the\nnation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse\nclearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug\nabuse) and 25. (c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\n\n5\nApplicant did write that he accepted an automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation related to future drug use. However, I can not conclude at this time that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct comes within any Mitigating Condition (MC). Based on the\nApplicant\u2019s many years of knowingly using an illegal substance, especially during his\ncurrent employment, his lack of candor regarding the recency of his drug involvement to\nthe Vice President of his company who submitted a character letter on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf, his history of abstaining from marijuana usage for periods of time and\nsubsequently reusing the drug, and his equivocal statement of his unwillingness to use\nmarijuana again, I find that it is simply too soon to conclude that Applicant will not use\nillegal substances in the future. \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has failed to introduced significant, persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome the Government's\ncase against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1, Guideline H of the SOR is concluded\nagainst Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline H, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above as to why no MC applies, and the lack of weight I have\ngiven to his employer\u2019s character letter, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough reviewed of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted four and denied three of the allegations under Guideline F. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 35 years old and has been a security official for a defense contractor at an isolated Department of Defense facility since January 2008. Prior to obtaining that job, he was a car salesman. He is a college graduate, with some credits towards a Master's degree. He is not married. Applicant only made sufficient salary to support his minimum monthly expenses until he started working for the defense contractor in January 2008. His monthly net pay is now approximately $3,000. He has no living expenses because of his location at the isolated facility where all of his basic living needs are provided by his employer. He owns a car for which he recently made the final payment. Since a personal car is not allowed at the isolated location, the car is in storage where he formerly lived. The funds used for car payments are now available to make payments on other debts. (Tr. 22-24, 31-35, 37-42, 54-56; Gov. Ex. 1, Security clearance application, dated October 5, 2007).

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) on October 5, \n2007.  On December 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 2, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 12, 2009.  He denied three of \nthe allegations under Guideline F since the accounts had been paid in full.  He admitted \nthe remaining four allegations.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 6, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on April 7, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 16, 2009, \nfor a hearing on May 11, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered three exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The record was held open \nat Applicant's request so he could submit documentation of debt payments and a debt \nmanagement plan.  Applicant timely submitted three documents marked Applicant \nExhibits A-C received without objection (See, Gov. Ex 4, Memorandum, dated May 14, \n2009; Gov. Ex. 5, E-mail, dated June 4, 2009; Gov. Ex. 6, E-Mail, dated June 11, 2009). \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 19, 2009.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel notified Applicant in early April 2009 that he had his request \nfor hearing and sought Appellant's availability for a hearing.  After both parties consulted \nwith me, I issued a Notice of Hearing on April 16, 2009, for a hearing on May 11, 2009.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant was unsure when he received the written official notice of \nhearing.  Subsequent to the hearing, the receipt for the Notice of Hearing was received \nwith Applicant noting he received the Notice on May 30, 2009.  Applicant misdated the \nreceipt for the hearing since he stated at the hearing on May 11, 2009, that he had \nreceived the notice.  Applicant, after being advised of his right to 15 days notice of a \nhearing, specifically waived the 15 day notice requirement (Tr. 5-7).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough reviewed of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted four and denied three of the \nallegations under Guideline F.  He provided additional information to support his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and has been a security official for a defense contractor \nat an isolated Department of Defense facility since January 2008.  Prior to obtaining that \njob, he was a car salesman.  He is a college graduate, with some credits towards a \nMaster's degree.  He is not married.  Applicant only made sufficient salary to support his \nminimum monthly expenses until he started working for the defense contractor in \nJanuary 2008.  His monthly net pay is now approximately $3,000.  He has no living \nexpenses because of his location at the isolated facility where all of his basic living \nneeds are provided by his employer.  He owns a car for which he recently made the \nfinal payment.  Since a personal car is not allowed at the isolated location, the car is in \nstorage where he formerly lived.  The funds used for car payments are now available to \nmake payments on other debts. (Tr. 22-24, 31-35, 37-42, 54-56; Gov. Ex. 1, Security \nclearance application, dated October 5, 2007). \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 2, Credit report, dated July 29. 2008; and Gov. Ex. 3, \nCredit report, dated December 10, 2008) show that Applicant had the following \ndelinquent debts; consolidated student loans of $58,346 in collection (SOR 1.a); a \ncharged off credit card account for $253 (SOR 1.b); another charged off credit card \n\n \n3 \n \n \naccount for $2,870 (SOR 1.c), a student loan to a university in collection for $2,914 \n(SOR 1.d); a cell phone account in collection for $422 (SOR 1.e); a student loan from a \nstate agency in collection for $7,575 (SOR 1.f); and another student loan from the same \nstate agency in collection for $4,410 (SOR 1.g). \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g.  He denied SOR \nallegations 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, since they had been paid.  Department counsel \nacknowledged that the debts listed in allegations 1.b, and 1.e had been settled and \npaid.  The latest credit report shows these two accounts have been paid (Tr. 13, 17-18; \nSee, Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated December 10, 2008).  Applicant provided \ninformation that the student loan to a university has been paid (Tr. 18-19, 43-44; App. \nEx. A, Account statement, dated May 12, 2009).   \n \nApplicant attended various colleges using student loans to receive a degree.  He \nwas a full-time student with a part-time job most of the time.  Sometimes, he attended \non a part-time basis while working full time.  He received a Bachelor's degree in History \nin 1998.  About 90% of his schooling costs were covered by student loans.  Three of the \nfour admitted delinquent debts are for student loans totaling about $70,000 (Tr. 43-44; \nSOR 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g).  Most of Applicant's student loans were consolidated into one \nloan of approximately $58,346.  He had difficulty finding employment in his chosen field \nof law enforcement because he has petit mal epilepsy.  He would be selected for a \nposition but he was unable to pass the physical.  When he did not find a law \nenforcement position, he worked in lower paying security positions.  His student loans \nwere deferred for a time but went delinquent in spring 2005 because of his lack of full-\ntime employment (Tr. 19-28).  \n \nThe collection agency for the consolidated student loan creditor started \ngarnishment action to collect on Applicant's student loans.  After Applicant learned of \nthe garnishment action, he entered an agreement in March 2009 with the collection \nagency to establish a plan to pay approximately $627 monthly for twelve months.  After \nmaking the $627 payments for a year, the loan will be transferred to the Department of \nEducation, and the interest rate for the student loans will be lowered with corresponding \nlower monthly payments.  Applicant has made two payments of $627 towards this plan \n(Tr. 35-42; App. Ex. B, Agreement, dated June 4, 2009).   \n \nApplicant has not reached a settlement or made any payments towards the two \nstudent loans held by the state agency for $4,410 and $7,575 as noted in SOR 1f, and \n1.g.  Applicant intends to start paying these loans in June 2009 when he returns to the \nisolated location.  He has the funds to make these payments since he no longer has a \ncar loan payment.  He anticipates these loans will be paid by the end of 2010 (Tr. 49-\n50).   \n \nApplicant has a settlement agreement with the collection agency for the credit \ncard debt at SOR 1.c.  He will pay $1,000 by the end of June 2009, and $1,330.58 by \nthe end of July 2009.  Applicant's plan is to pay $2,000 from his approximately $3,000 of \nmonthly disposable income to pay student loans and the other credit card payments.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHe will save the remaining $1,000 each month (Tr. 51-54; App. Ex. C, Letter, dated \nJune 4, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant's delinquent student loan debts and a delinquent credit card debt \nas admitted by Applicant and listed on the credit reports are a security concern raising \nFinancial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations).   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony.  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \ndoes not apply.  Applicant had periods of unemployment but that did not prevent him \nfrom purchasing an expensive car.  While some of the debts have been paid, the \nremaining debts are current and have only been recently addressed.  For example, \nApplicant has only recently reached an agreement to settle the remaining credit card \ndebt and payments under the plan have not yet started.  His debts did not arise under \nunusual circumstances and were incurred voluntarily by Applicant to finance his \neducation. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) has some application.  Applicant's chosen \ncareer field was law enforcement.  He was unable to find employment in that field \nbecause of a medical condition.  He did work some low paying security jobs while \nseeking a law enforcement position.  He also worked selling cars.  He purchased an \n\n \n6 \n \n \nexpensive car which could indicate he did not act responsibly under the circumstances.  \nHowever, he has managed to pay off this car which does show responsible behavior.  \n  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant paid three of the debts and was \nable to complete payment of a car loan.  He settled the one remaining credit card debt \nand will make two payments on the debt in the next month to complete payments.  He \nhas been making payments according to a plan on the consolidated student loans.  \nWhile he has not started paying the remaining two student loans with the state agency, \nhe will start shortly.  He has a concrete sustainable plan to pay his debts.  Applicant has \nmitigated security concerns based on his finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant had \ndifficulty finding good employment at a good salary in his chosen field because of a \nmedical condition.  His lack of meaningful employment opportunities created financial \nproblems.  I considered that the majority of his delinquent debts are for student loans \nused to further his job potential.  Applicant has paid three of the seven listed debts, and \nhas payment plans to pay two other debts, including the largest a student loan.  He has \nnot begun to pay towards two other student loans.  Normally promises to pay in the \nfuture do not indicate that an individual made a good-faith effort to resolve delinquent \ndebts.  Applicant developed plans to pay his remaining debts and he is making \n\n \n7 \n \n \npayments according to those plans.  Even though he has not initiated action on two \nstudent loanse, his meaningful track record of debt payments so far, coupled with the \nfact that he has the needed assets to make payments according to his plan, shows that \nhe will continue in good-faith to resolve his debts.  Applicant understands that he must \ncontinue to resolve his delinquent debts to maintain access to classified information.  \nHis actions to resolve his debts do not indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  He is not financially overextended.  \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 5, p 3 and Item 4, p 5 \u2013 10) In her SOR \nresponse, she did not indicated to which period of unemployment she was referring. \nApplicant stated she has \u201chad bad credit for years while holding a clearance and it \nnever affected my integrity.\u201d  \n \nApplicant has the following unpaid debts: a $303 collection agency debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), a $5,365 collection agency debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $7,454 bank credit card debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d), a $266 collection agency debt collection for a telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), a \n$490 telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f), a $753 bank credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $240 \nclothing store credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and a $340 telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i.).  \n \nApplicant denied a $19,742 bank credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). On Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2008 credit report, this debt is listed as a charged off account with a balance of \n$19,742. (Item 5, p 9) In Applicant\u2019s October 2007 interview, Applicant asserts the \noriginal debt was her father\u2019s credit card debt. Her father died and her mother suffered \nfrom Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Applicant had the debt put in her name and arranged to pay \n$150 per month on it. Payments stopped in early 2006 when Applicant\u2019s work hours \n \n \n \n2\n\nwere reduced. (Item 5, p 26) Applicant asserts she hired an attorney to address this \ndebt. Applicant provided no documentation related to the dispute of this debt or action \nby her attorney. \n \nIn the mid-1990s, Applicant obtained a $3,000 loan for moving expenses. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b) In early 2005, she stopped payments on this debt when she was unemployed for a \nfew months. In 2002, Applicant had a clothing company credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.h), with a \n$100 limit. She stopped making payments in early 2005. In 2000, she opened two bank \ncredit cards with $300 limits. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) In 2005, she stopped making payments on \nthese cards when her work hours were cut from 48 to 32 hours per week. (Item 5, p 22)  \n \nApplicant had two telephone debts. She knows nothing about the $340 telephone \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). In 2004, she changed telephone service providers and was unable to \npay the final bill due to being out of work on disability for 4 or 5 weeks. In 2006, \nApplicant opened a credit card account with a $300 limit. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) She used the \ncard for gasoline and car repairs. \n \nIn April 2005, she obtained a job with 40 hours per week plus eight hours per \nweek of overtime. Shortly after she started, her hours were reduced to 32 per week with \nno overtime. Additionally, the plant were she worked would periodically shut down for \ntwo weeks at a time with no pay to the employees. In October 2006, she was out of \nwork on disability for five or six weeks following back surgery. In April 2007, she was \nlaid off due to company consolidation and her branch plant being closed.  \n \nIn June 2007, she obtained her current job. In June 2008, Applicant asserts she \nwas paying $100 each month to pay a $1,490 bank debt, which is not a debt of concern \nlisted in the SOR. (Item 5, p 20) In October 2007, Applicant asserted she hoped to have \na payment plan in place by the end of 2007 to address her financial problems. (Item 5, p \n24)  \n \nAs of October 2007, Applicant\u2019s gross monthly income was approximately $3,000 \nand her monthly expenses were $2,000. After paying her debts, Applicant\u2019s net \nremainder was approximately $400. (Item 5, p 6) She has no credit cards.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2008 SOR response, she asserts she was addressing her \ndebts in the wrong way by addressing one bill at a time. She acknowledges she should \nhave sought help with her credit problems earlier. She stated she had contacted a \ncompany to assist her with her credit and to establish a plan to address her financial \nproblems. No documentation concerning assistance provided by this company was \npresented. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n \n \n3\n\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \n \n \n4\n\n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit report, her \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, her SOR \nresponse, and her response to interrogatories. Applicant has admitted responsibility for \nall but one of her delinquent debts. She disputes owing a debt of approximately $20,000 \nstating it was her father\u2019s debt that she assumed. She hired an attorney to dispute this \ndebt, but provided no corroboration of this dispute. She has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show significant progress resolving any of her debts. There is no \ndocumentation that even the four smallest debts, which are each less than $350, have \nbeen paid or addressed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n5\n\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her \nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and did not occur under circumstances \nnot likely to recur. She failed to demonstrate that her debts were largely due to \ncircumstances beyond her control, or that she has acted responsibly in addressing her \ndebts. Further, she has not sought credit counseling, or otherwise brought the problem \nunder control as her circumstances permitted.  \n \nAG & 20(b) has limited applicability since Applicant has experienced periods of \nunemployment. However, she has had stable employment since June 2007 and even \nthe four smallest debts have yet to be paid. Additionally, Applicant failed to show how \nthese periods of unemployment impacted her current finances. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant has paid none of the nine debts listed \nin the SOR. The total amount of unpaid debt is approximately $35,000. She was making \n$150 per month on debt not listed in the SOR. In October 2008, she stated she had \ncontacted a credit company to establish a plan to address her financial problems. This \nassertion is tempered by her October 2007 statement that she hoped to have a \nrepayment plan established by the end of 2007. She has had hopes of addressing her \ndebts before, but has not been able to follow thorough with payment. The desire to pay \none\u2019s debts is important as it arranging a repayment plan to address past due \nobligations. But it is also important that payment actually be made on the debts. \n \nApplicant assumed her father\u2019s $19,742 credit card debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) She made \nmonthly payments on the debt until early 2006. She asserts she has hired an attorney to \ndispute this debt, but provided no documentation or other corroboration. Under AG & \n20(e) \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d must be provided. Applicant has failed to do this. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n \n6\n\n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts are not the type that \nindicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Also, the money was not spent frivolously, nor incurred on luxuries. \nHowever, the debts remain unpaid. Applicant asserts she will establish a repayment \nplan, but she made a similar claim in October 2007, and was unable to follow through \nwith payment. There is nothing in the record to indicate that this time she will be able to \nfollow through and actually make the payments. \n \nBased on the totality of the evidence available in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nShe has not taken effective action to resolve her debts, and has not equipped herself to \navoid financial problems in the future. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, she may \nwell demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a clearance \nat this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n7\n\n \n \n \n8\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge\n\n1 \n  1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on January 9, 2008 (Item 5).  On August 6, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant \ndetailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F (Item 1).  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 30, 2008, admitting all of the \nallegations in the SOR (Items 3 and 4).  She elected to have the matter decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on September 23, 2008.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) on October 27, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file \nobjections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM or provide additional material.  The \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase was assigned to me on January 21, 2008.  Based on a review of the case file and \npleadings, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel noted a typographical error in SOR 1.d in that the amount \npast due was listed at $1,64.00 when it should have been $1,064.00.  Applicant was \nnotified of the requested amendment when the FORM was sent on September 23, \n2008.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM and therefore did not object to the \namendment.  SOR 1.d is amended to show the amount past due as $1,064.00. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has been employed as a customer service \nrepresentative for a defense contractor since June 2000.  She is listed as married on \nthe e-QIP with no children but it is unclear from the file if she is still married.  There is an \nindication that she was planning to divorce her husband in 2007 (Item 5, e-QIP, and \nItem 6, Answers to Interrogatories).  In her answers to the Interrogatories, dated July \n23, 2008, Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement listing her monthly net pay \nas $1,600, with monthly expenses of $1,155, leaving discretionary or disposable funds \nof $345 monthly.  In response to questions by a security investigator, Applicant stated \nher monthly income was $1,942, with a net remainder for discretionary spending of \n$563 (Item 6 at 12-13).  Applicant listed in response to financial questions on the e-QIP \na garnishment in 2007, a repossession in 2005, a bankruptcy in 2001, and an \nautomobile loan in 2001 that was more than 180 days past due. (Item 5, e-QIP at 24-\n25).   \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2001 and her debts of about \n$10,000 were discharged in November 2002 (SOR 1.a; Item 6, Answers to \nInterrogatories, dated July 23, 2008).  The SOR lists six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $20,461 that arose after the discharge in bankruptcy and are confirmed \nby a credit report dated February 1, 2008 (Item 7).  Applicant admits these debts (Item \n4).  She also provided a credit report of July 15, 2008 as part of her response to \nInterrogatories that also confirms the debts (Item 6, at 18-31).  The debts include a \nmortgage past due in the amount of $6,291 (SOR 1.b); a credit card debt place for \ncollection for $776 (SOR 1.c); another mortgage past due for $1,064 (SOR 1.d); an \nautomobile loan charged off for $4,956 (SOR 1.e); an account placed for collection for \n$778 (SOR 1.f); and a charged off cell phone debt for $596 (SOR 1.g; See Item 7, \nCredit Report, dated February 1, 2008).   \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that her husband took a toll on \ntheir finances by taking out pay day loans.  She is trying to clear the debts and stated \nthat she has worked out a payment plan with creditors and her husband is attempting to \nnot have their house foreclosed.  She also noted that she did not remember a tax debt \nto the city where their house was located.  She noted that she is a trustworthy person \nwho has never broken the trust of her customers.  She values the trust of her customers \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand would never do anything to compromise their security.  She did not present any \ndocuments to verify the attempt to repay the loans or to keep the house from being \nforeclosed (Item 6, Answers to Interrogatories, at 2-3). \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on March 11, 2008, Applicant \nstated that she left her husband in January 2008 and planned to file for divorce.  She \nleft him because of his mental instability and alcohol consumption problems.  These \nproblems caused them financial problems.  When they first married in 2002, they had a \njoint checking account but it was closed because her husband wrote worthless checks.  \nHe wrote worthless checks to cash advance stores that she had to make arrangements \nto repay.  She did not know what he did with the funds.  They were able to purchase a \nhouse but they could not make the mortgage payments.  She initially borrowed funds \nfrom her grandmother to make the back mortgage payments.  Applicant stated that she \nhas every intention of paying all of her debts.  Applicant was starting the process to \nseek assistance from a credit counselor.  She presented no information that she \ncontinued to pursue credit counseling (Item 6 at 8). \n \nApplicant stated the mortgage debts at SOR 1.b and SOR 1.d are the same \nmortgage debt with one listing the immediate past due and one listing the entire amount \npast due.  After she left her husband, he was to make the mortgage payments but did \nnot because he was unemployed.  She expects the house to go into foreclosure.  Since \nthe debts are the same, I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.d.  \n \nThe credit card debt at SOR 1.c was used to buy personal items like groceries, \ngas, and a week-end trip.  She was unable to make payments because of her \nhusband's actions.  She did not remember any notices for court action but did \nremember a garnishment notice.  Applicant's husband promised to assist her with the \ncar loan at SOR 1.e but he did not.  After she was unable to make payments and the \ncar was repossessed in 2006, she received a call from the finance company to make \npayment arrangements but she did not return the call since she did not have funds to \nmake payments.  The debt at SOR 1.f was for a computer she planned to use to attend \ncollege courses.  She was unable to attend the course or make payments on the \ncomputer because of the financial problems caused by her husband.  Applicant and her \nhusband had cell phone service through the same carrier.  They fell behind on payment \nafter about six months of service.  She receives occasional letters from a collection \ncompany concerning payments, but she has not responded.  She believes the debt is \nabout $500 (Item 6 at 10-11).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts that arose after debts were discharged in \nbankruptcy are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\"; and FC DC \u00b6 \n19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial obligations\".  Applicant accumulated delinquent \ndebts because she was unable to pay her financial obligations.  The debts were \naccumulated after her previous debts had been discharged by bankruptcy.  Applicant \nblamed her inability to make payments because of the actions of her husband.  \nHowever, she has been steadily employed since her previous debts were discharged \nand she did not provide information to establish how her husband's actions impacted \nher ability to make payments on her debts while being steadily employed.  The record \nfrom credit reports and responses to interrogatories show her inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts and that she has a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\".  Applicant has taken no action to \npay the delinquent debts so the debts are current.  The debts are from various sources, \ncredit cards, a loan, a phone bill, a mortgage, and a car loan, so they are not infrequent.  \nSince the debts are current and not paid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  The mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\".  Applicant claims the debts were \ncause by her husband's action in taken out cash loans and not paying their debts.  She \nacknowledged receiving information and calls concerning some of the loans but has not \ntaken any action to return the calls or to seek payment plans on the debts.  She has \nbeen steadily employed and has a net remainder of funds each month.  She presented \nno information on how or why her husband's actions impacted her ability to make some \npayments on her debts.  There has been no attempt to pay past due obligations when \nshe has a positive monthly cash flow which indicates she is not trying to resolve her \nindebtedness.  While some of the debt may have been caused by her husband's action, \nthe debt payment is also her responsibility and payment was within her control.  She \nhas not established she acted responsibly in managing her finances and making \npayments on her obligations. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\".  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show she has a plan to pay the debts or any \naction that she has taken to pay her debts.  Applicant has sufficient income to make \nsome payments on her delinquent debts but has not attempted to do so.  Applicant's \ndebts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2002 and she started accumulating delinquent \ndebts again in 2004  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving \nindebtedness.  However, the circumstances of the bankruptcy action can be examined \nto determine any security significance.  The filing of the bankruptcy action in itself does \nnot create a security concern.  Applicant accumulated delinquent debt after the \nbankruptcy discharge indicating a continual irresponsible and indifferent attitude \ntowards her finances.  There is no indication Applicant acted responsibly towards her \ndebts or that the situation is under control.  Some of her creditors tried to establish \ncontact with her to resolve the indebtedness but she deliberately did not respond to \nthem.  Her finances are not under control and she has not acted responsibly.  Applicant \nhas not presented sufficient information to indicate a good faith effort to pay creditors or \nresolve debts.  She has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken action to resolve her past due debts.  Her indifferent \nattitude, her failure to respond to her creditors, and her lack of actions shows she is not \ntrustworthy, responsible, or that she exercises good judgment.  Applicant has been \nirresponsible towards her delinquent debts and financial obligations.  This is an \nindication that she might be irresponsible towards the protection and handling of \nclassified information.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from her finances.  Clearance is denied. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
