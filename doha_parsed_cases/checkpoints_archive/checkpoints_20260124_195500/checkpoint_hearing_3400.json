(GE 1 at 61-62, GE 3 at 3) In April 2018, he quit his job in \nState 1 and moved to State 2 in anticipation of being hired into the position he had been \npursuing. (GE 1 at 16; Tr. 51-53) He was unemployed from April 2018 to July 2018 \nbecause of unexpected delay by the prospective employer. (Id.) In July 2018, he accepted \na position with the defense contractor in State 2 with an annual salary of $62,000, about \n$23,000 less than he had anticipated.

(Tr. 49, 107) He and his wife currently \nhave no car payment and own a 17-year-old car (formerly their daughter\u2019s), and a 19-\nyear-old minivan (gifted by a neighbor). (Tr. 88; GE 6) He no longer uses credit cards and \nhas no open credit card accounts. (Tr. 87; GE 6) \nI found Applicant's responses and demeanor at the hearing to be credible and \nconsistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth. After reviewing the entire \nrecord, I find that his hearing testimony is corroborated by documentary evidence \nsubmitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly responded to all questions \nand was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts \nApplicant held a security clearance while serving in the Navy and routinely handled \nclassified information without reported incident. (GE 1; Tr. 10, 108) He received at least \nnine personal awards during his naval service which detail his significant contributions to \nDOD operations including in Iraq. The award citations note his exemplary performance \nand character, leadership, unrelenting perseverance, diligence, complete dedication to \nduty, exceptional professionalism, and judgment. (AE E) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when his family relocated to a different state \nafter he retired from the Navy, and he overextended himself by purchasing a home in that \nstate before securing employment there. Several months later he left a well-paying job \nnear his final Navy duty station to join his family for an employment opportunity that did \nnot materialize as expected. He was unemployed for almost three months before \naccepting a position that paid approximately $23,000 less annually than he had \nanticipated. He contemplated filing for bankruptcy but opted to pay some debts on his \nown and enrolled the remainder into a DCC payment plan. \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had paid creditors at least $29,856 of the \n$54,011 of SOR debt as well as some non-SOR debt. He has resolved the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.i, and successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He \nhas made substantial payments on and is in the process of resolving the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g through his DCC payment plan, and the five remaining SOR \ndebts totaling $12,148 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.j and 1.k) are also included in the DCC \nagreement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established for the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by circumstances partially or fully \nbeyond his control. He has acted responsibly by prioritizing and paying some of his \ndelinquent debts, seeking financial counseling, and enrolling the remaining SOR debt in \na payment plan. \nHe has a logical and appropriate plan for resolving the remaining SOR debts, and \nthere are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. He has dramatically altered his lifestyle and spending habits. He sold his home \nand rents an affordable condominium; he voluntarily returned his expensive new truck \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand now owns two older vehicles; he has resolved other debt and enrolled the remainder \nin a payment plan. His income has significantly increased, and he understands the \nsecurity implications of delinquent debt. His debts were incurred under circumstances \nmaking recurrence unlikely and his conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record including \nApplicant\u2019s work history, security clearance history, and years of service supporting the \nDepartment of Defense. I also considered that his financial problems were caused, in \npart, \nby \ncircumstances \nbeyond \nhis \ncontrol \nincluding \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment, and that he has acted responsibly regarding his debts. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in \nhis debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \n[he] act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017). Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial \nresponsibility. He has taken reasonable actions under his unique financial circumstances \nto address his delinquent debts and has established a \u201cmeaningful track record of debt \nreduction.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole supports \na conclusion that the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, \nare mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nEric C.

He previously served in the U.S. Navy from September 1997 to \nNovember 2018. He was first granted access to classified information in 2014. He \ncompleted his most recent security clearance application in August 2019 and disclosed \nthat he retired from military service as a senior chief petty officer (E-8) following \nallegations of misconduct. The incidents prompting his retirement are alleged in the \nSOR. \nBetween June 2016 and November 2018, Applicant served onboard an aircraft \ncarrier. In June 2017, the command investigated allegations that Applicant violated the \nNavy\u2019s sexual harassment and fraternization policies by making inappropriate \ncomments to an unidentified junior sailor and engaging in an inappropriate text \nmessage conversation with another unidentified junior sailor. While the investigation did \nnot substantiate some of the more egregious allegations, the carrier\u2019s commanding \nofficer (CO) determined the nature of the substantiated allegations warranted Applicant \nreceiving a non-punitive letter of caution in July 2017. (GE 1; GE 3, pp. 30-31) In the \nletter, the CO admonished Applicant: \nI have determined the substantiated statements are sufficiently concerning \nand your failure to maintain a proper and professional relationship with \nanother of your junior sailor must be affirmatively addressed to ensure \nyour future conduct complies with the Navy\u2019s established policies and my \nexpectations\u2026. \nYour text message exchange with a junior sailor was inappropriate and \nundermined your status as a senior chief petty officer especially when \nother junior sailors learned of the exchange.

(GE 3, pp \n30-31) \nAlthough the letter was considered non-punitive, it constituted a lawful order from \nhis CO that Applicant was required to obey. (Tr. 34) \nIn October 2017, the carrier\u2019s executive officer and the command master chief \nreceived an anonymous complaint that Applicant was having an inappropriate \nrelationship with a junior sailor (JS1). The deputy command judge advocate (DCJA) \nlaunched a second investigation into Applicant\u2019s conduct. The investigation \nsubstantiated that Applicant had an unduly familiar relationship with JS1, in violation of \nthe Navy\u2019s fraternization policy and the July 2017 letter of caution. The investigation \nalso determined that he sexually harassed, a second sailor, JS2, by making \ninappropriate comments towards her, touching her inappropriately on multiple \noccasions, and making inappropriate comments about her to other sailors. (GE 3, pp. \n46, 69-73) \nThe DCJA also investigated allegations that Applicant sexually harassed a third \nsailor, JS3. JS3 separated from the Navy before the investigation began and she could \nnot be contacted. However, the DCJA considered the allegations regarding JS3 another \n\u201cdata point in Applicant\u2019s pattern of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior.\u201d The \nDCJA recommended that Applicant be taken to Captain\u2019s Mast; that he be removed \nfrom any supervisory role and that he be detached from for cause. The DCJA also \nrecommended the CO take any \u201cadditional actions as necessary to end Applicant\u2019s \ncareer in the Navy.\u201d (GE 3, pp 45-73) \nIn December 2017, Applicant was charged with six specifications of violating \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 92: failure to obey an order. He pled \nguilty to five specifications: (1) having an unduly familiar relationship with JS1; (2) \nviolating the Navy\u2019s sexual harassment policy by wrongfully touching and making \nunwanted comments of a sexual nature regarding the appearance of JS2; (3) violating \nthe July 2017 letter of caution by continuing to engage in an unduly familiar and \nunprofessional relationship with JS1; (4) violating the July 2017 letter of caution by \ncontinuing to engage in an unduly familiar and unprofessional relationship with JS2; and \n(5) violating the Navy\u2019s sexual harassment policy by wrongfully making unwanted \nsexual advances, and making inappropriate comments to JS3. He was found not guilty \nof a sixth charge of making offensive or racial comments in violation of the Navy\u2019s equal \nopportunity program. He was sentenced to 45 days restriction (25 days suspended for \nsix months). Applicant appealed the sentence, specifically requesting reconsideration of \nhis detachment for cause as a separate administrative action as being unjust and \ndisproportionate.

In support of his recommendation, \nthe CO noted that Applicant admitted to engaging in the conduct for which he was found \nguilty at Captain\u2019s Mast. The CO also believed that the punishment was both just and \nproportional to Applicant\u2019s misconduct. In response to Applicant\u2019s request for \nreconsideration of being detached for cause, the CO noted that detachment for cause is \nnot a punishment issued at Captain\u2019s Mast but explained that detachment for cause was \nappropriate in Applicant\u2019s case. (GE 3, pp 10-12) \nThe CO explained that Applicant\u2019s conduct had been an ongoing issue since he \nwas a second-class petty officer (E-5). He described Applicant\u2019s behavior as being \nparticularly egregious given that he received the July 2017 letter of caution months \nbefore the October 2017 investigation. The CO further described Applicant\u2019s behavior \nas \u201cso wholly toxic, unprofessional, and not in keeping with Navy Core Values that he \ncannot continue to act in a senior leadership role in any capacity onboard the carrier.\u201d \nThe CO commented that Applicant demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of the \nNavy\u2019s expectations and standards for leadership and professional behavior. The \ncommand denied Applicant\u2019s appeal. (GE 3, pp 10-12) \nIn May 2018, Applicant requested permission to retire in lieu of an administrative \nseparation termination. His command supported the request, recommending a \ndischarge classification as general under honorable conditions. The request was \napproved, and he retired in November 2018 with 21 years of service. (GE 3, 15-17) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to obey the order in the July 2017 letter of \ncaution to discontinue his inappropriate relationships with junior sailors, resulting in the \nDecember 2017 investigation into additional allegations of misconduct. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The \nSOR also alleges that the December 2017 investigation resulted in a Captain\u2019s Mast in \nwhich Applicant was charged with and pleaded guilty to failure to obey a lawful order \nregarding the Navy\u2019s fraternization policy (SOR \u00b6 1.b); two violations of the Navy\u2019s \nsexual harassment policy (SOR \u00b6 1.c. and 1.e); failure to maintain proper and \nprofessional relationships with junior sailors (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he was ultimately \ngranted permission to retire from the Navy with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions in lieu of appearing before an administrative separation board (SOR 1.f). \nIn his answer to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant admitted to engaging in the \nunderlying conduct, which is why he decided to plead guilty to the charges at Captain\u2019s \nMast. He continues to deny that his actions constituted sexual harassment. Applicant \nargued that if the Navy truly deemed his conduct to be sexual harassment that he would \nhave been criminally charged, reduced in rank, and detached for cause. He further \nexplained that he requested permission to retire because he was tired of having to \nprove his innocence and did not have the data necessary to prove his case. He felt as if \nhe had no way of winning. (Tr. 46-48; Answer) \nApplicant claims that he has not engaged in any similar behaviors at his current \njob, and that he will not engage in similar behavior in the future. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nof potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant admits that he disobeyed the order his CO gave him in the July 2017 \nletter of caution by continuing to have inappropriate contact with junior sailors, that his \nbehavior resulted in his pleading guilty to five specifications of violating Article 92 of \nUCMJ at Captain\u2019s Mast and led to his retirement from the U.S. Navy in November 2018 \nin lieu of appearing before an administrative board.

Even though the \nconduct resulting in Applicant\u2019s retirement from the Navy happened almost six years \nago, it is not mitigated by the passage of time, nor can it be considered minor. Applicant \ndemonstrated a pattern of behavior showing blatant disregard for rules and regulations. \nFurthermore, he continues to minimize and does not accept responsibility for his \nmisconduct. He willfully acted in direct contravention of Navy policies that were well \nknown to him (e.g., sexual harassment and fraternization) and in direct violation of a \nlawful order to correct his behavior. However, he continues to believe that his behavior \nwas not as serious as determined by his chain of command. This attitude raises \nongoing doubts about his ability to follow the rules and regulations that apply to the \nhandling and safeguarding of classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have also evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole-person factors at AG \n\u00b6 2(d).

A hearing was scheduled for \nJanuary 25, 2023, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of two exhibits. (GEs 1-2) Applicant relied on five exhibits. \n(AEs A-O) and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 3, \n2022. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the convening of the hearing, the Government amended the SOR to add \nthe following allegations under Guideline F: Applicant is indebted (c) to his state of \nresidence (State 3) for $184 for tax year 2013; (d) to his former state of residence (State \n2) for $4,542 for tax year 2015; (e) to the Federal Government for $458 for tax year \n2016;; (f) to State 3 for $38.00 for tax year 2016; (g) to State 1 for $13,031 for tax year \n2016; (h) to State 2 for $885 for tax year 2016; (i) to the Federal Government for $8,204 \nfor tax year 2017; and (j) to State 1 for $9,137 for tax year 2017.  \nIn his response to the amended SOR allegations, Applicant denied each of the \nallegations with explanations and clarifications. He claimed mitigation based on \ncircumstances that trace to 2013 and do not currently reflect his currently exhibited \nmaturity, responsibility, and unwavering desire to resolve his situation. He claimed he \nhas since filed all necessary Federal and state taxes for the years in question with the \nhelp of numerous professionals and credible sources. And, he claimed the benefit of \noverall professional achievement and recognition as a reliable and trustworthy network \nengineer who warrants considerable credit under a whole-person analysis. Applicant \nattached copies of his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013-2017. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his updated \nstate payment status. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 21 calendar days \nto supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant submitted updates of his payment progress with his \nstate taxing agencies. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objections as AEs \nP-R. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly failed to file his federal and state income \ntax returns, as required, for tax years 2013 through 2017. Allegedly, these tax returns \nremain unfiled. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed he has since filed his federal and state tax returns for the \nyears in issue and has mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns. He also claimed \nthat he is extremely talented and a professional who is a true asset to the country. He \nfurther claimed that he moved multiple times and experienced job layoffs and the loss of \ntax documents needed for filing his tax returns. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn his response, Applicant claimed, too, that he was continuously frustrated in his \nuse of Turbo tax planning and encountered repeated difficulties in his attempts to \nnavigate the program. He claimed that he has since filed his federal and state 2013-\n2017 tax returns in January 2022, and has resolved the Government\u2019s concerns with \nthe aid of tax professionals he has enlisted to help him. And, he claimed that he was \ntold by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that he overpaid $8,000 for tax year 2013 \nand ultimately overpaid his taxes despite not having timely filed to claim a tax refund. \nApplicant attached copies of his filed tax returns, along with endorsements from \ncolleagues and friends.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in March 2003 and divorced in March 2007. (GE 1; Tr. 32, 58) \nHe has no children from this marriage. He remarried in in October 2011, and has one \nstepchild from this marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 33-34) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nJune 2006. (GE 1 and AE I) He reported no military service. \nSince May 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nnetwork engineer. (GE 1; Tr.26, 80) Between October 2013 and May 2016, he worked \nas a network engineer for another defense contractor in State 2 (his prior state of \nresidence). (GE 1) In this job, he typically worked at two main sites: one in State 1 (his \ncurrent employment state) and the other in State 3 (his current state of residence). (GE \n1) \nApplicant reported brief unemployment (between January 2013 and April 2013) \nand work for another defense contractor (located in State 2) between September 2006 \nand January 2013 as a senior network administrator, who was detailed primarily \noverseas. (GE 1; Tr. 33-35, 59) Applicant has held a security clearance since February \n2008. (GE 1; Tr. 26) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nRecords document that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns, as required, for tax years 2013 through 2017. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 30) He \nattributed his tax filing lapses to (a) anxiety attacks when facing stressful situations like \nfiling tax returns and (b) losing or misplacing material tax information during his multiple \nrelocations. (Tr. 26-32) \nDuring first his marriage (2003-2007), Applicant\u2019s wife (a tax accountant by\ntraining) handled the preparation and filing of their federal and state tax returns.

(AEs D-E; Tr. 59-60) In 2017, Applicant \nretained a tax accounting firm to help him with filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns without material documents he had lost. (Tr. 47) \nBy April 2021, Applicant learned from his retained tax preparers that they had not \nfiled his back tax returns as expected. (Tr. 48) Despite having paid this tax accounting \nfirm their demanded fees in April 2021, the firm never followed up with filing his 2013-\n2017 tax returns. (Tr. 48) Moreover, this tax preparer never responded with progress \nupdates. (Tr. 49-56) IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2016-2017 report additional taxes \nassessed, as well as penalties and interest imposed for late payments and non-filing of \ntax returns for the years in issue, but no notations of any installment agreements \nbetween Applicant and the IRS for these years. (AE J) IRS transcripts for tax years \n2013-2015 reveal no notations either of installment agreements between Applicant and \nthe IRS for these tax years. \nPressed by the IRS and state taxing authorities with demands for payments on \ntaxes owed for the 2013-2017 tax years, Applicant made the demanded payments \nwithout filing tax returns for these tax years (AEs K-N) and was credited with his \npayments. (AEs K-N; Tr. 49-52) Some of Applicant\u2019s payments to these taxing \nauthorities (notably a $31,400 payment to the IRS) were not made until after the \nissuance of the SOR. (AEs J-N) \nIn January 2021, Applicant retained his current tax preparer to help him in the \npreparation and filing of his tax returns and respond to a letter from the IRS demanding \n$32,000. (AE K; Tr. 49) However, this tax preparer never responded with progress \nupdates. (Tr. 49-56) Beginning in 2018, Applicant adjusted his tax payment practice and \ntendered $30,000 to the IRS to cover late taxes, interest, and penalties imposed by the \nIRS for tax year 2016. (AE J; Tr. 49) \nApplicant documented his self-filing of his federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2013-2019 between January 2022 and October 2022, well past the \nissuance of the SOR in August 2021, and without any documented extensions. (AEs F \nand J; Tr. 51-52, 60-62) Currently, Applicant uses a bookkeeper and accountant to help \nhim prepare and file his taxes. (Tr. 52-53) With his updated filing practice, he has been \nable to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021. (Tr. \n53-56) \nTaxes owed to State 1 (his employment state) for tax years 2016 ($13,031) and \n2017 ($9,137) have since been repaid in 2022 and credited to Applicant, along with his \nlate filing of State 1 income tax returns for these tax years. For only two of the tax years \nin issue (2016-2017) did Applicant apparently owe taxes to State 1, and this was due to \nhis commuting to the state from his current residence in State 3. (AE F and M) \nLikewise, taxes owed to State 2 for tax year 2015 ($4,542) and tax year 2016 \n($885) have reportedly been paid (dates unclear).

In the non-resident tax return he filed \nwith State 3 covering tax year 2016, he claimed source income from State 1 (of \n$211,633 in adjusted gross income and $199,287 after adjustments in State 1 source \nincome). (AE F) \nFor 2017, Applicant filed a partial resident tax return with State 3 and reported \nonly $10 in source income from that state, with the balance in source income reported \nto State 1 for that tax year. (AE F) Whether Applicant owes any more in allocated \nsource income to State 3 (a low tax state) after allowing for payment credits to State 1 \n(a high tax state) for tax years 2016 and 2017 is unclear. Applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain an \nupdated status report of any taxes owed to State 3 have been unsuccessful. (AE P) \nPayment credits for each of these states post-date the issuance of the SOR in August \n2021. Applicant\u2019s efforts to reach state 3 tax enforcement authorities to verify his tax \nstatus were unsuccessful despite his repeated efforts to verify his current tax status with \nthe state. \nBecause State 1 had reciprocity with State 3 (Applicant\u2019s state of residence \nduring the relevant tax years in question, tax years 2015-2018), Applicant reported all of \nhis earned income from his work in State 1 on his State 1 tax returns for tax years 2016 \nand 2017, with slight adjustments in 2016 to account for small State 3 source income. \n(AEs F and M; Tr. 80) And, because he has continued to commute to State 1 from State \n3, (allocating most of his source income to State 1 where his employer is located), he \nhas continued to treat State 1 as his principal taxing state jurisdiction. (Tr. 81-84) \nFederal taxes owed for tax years 2016 ($458) and 2017 ($8,204) total $45,599 \n(inclusive of assessed filing late penalties and accrued interest) according to IRS tax \ntranscripts. (AE J) After credits assigned to payments transferred in from prior tax years \n(totaling $35,702) for tax year 2017, the IRS reduced Applicant\u2019s owed taxes to $8,024 \non reported income of $177,415. (AEs F and J) Without more tax information from \nApplicant on his credited payments, his reported IRS balance owing for tax year 2017 \ncannot be favorably reconciled. \nExcept for his still unresolved tax liabilities, Applicant\u2019s finances appear to be in \nstable operating condition. His credit report assigned an excellent credit score of 805 on \nhis reported debts of $469,819. (AE O; Tr. 56) Although he could have likely benefitted \nfrom both mental health and financial counseling, he has opted for neither to help him \nwith his past tax filing difficulties, electing instead to address his tax returns by himself \nwith the aid of a bookkeeper and accountant. \nEndorsements \nApplicant is highly regarded by his company president, supervisors (past and \npresent), and his coworkers. (AEs G-H) His chief executive officer (CEO) expressed his \nappreciation for Applicant\u2019s \u201chard work, patience and support\u201d and rewarded him with a \nbonus for the 2021 calendar year.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

While he subsequently filed his \nfederal and state tax returns in 2022, his multiple filing lapses raise trust, reliability, and \njudgment concerns about his current and future ability to manage his finances safely \nand responsibly. Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation \nof delinquent federal and state tax debts over the same tax years. While state taxes \nowed for tax years 2013-2017 have since been satisfied, Applicant\u2019s payments were not \ncredited until after the issuance of the SOR. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses and accumulation of delinquent federal and \nstate taxes warrant the application of one of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing and payment failures \nare critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to \nclassified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR \nCase No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020) Federal and state tax returns filed by \napplicants after the issuance of an SOR have generally been held to fall short of the \nhigh standards of timeliness imposed on applicants seeking security clearance \neligibility. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808, supra; ISCR Case No. 14-00221, supra; and \nISCR Case No. 14-01894, supra. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of multiple tax-filing lapses and accumulating \ndelinquent tax debts is fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a security \nclearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his work in the defense industry, his \nefforts are not enough at this time to overcome his repeated failures or inability to \naddress his tax-filing and tax-paying responsibilities in a timely way over the course of \nmany years. \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on consideration of all the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it is \ntoo soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, \ngood-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the foreseeable \nfuture. More time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of stability with his \nfinances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(AE E) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe debts alleged in the SOR total about $127,000. They are established by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are detailed on credit reports from 2019 and 2020. \nHe asserted that most of them are not his responsibility, but he failed to provide \ndocumentation to support his claims that he was the victim of identity theft. The fact that \ndebts no longer appear on more recent credit reports is insufficient evidence that they \nare resolved. He provided no evidence, particularly documentary evidence, that any of \nthe debts have been paid or are being resolved. His child support arrearages are by far \nthe largest debts in the SOR. Two of his children are now adults, but he did not \nestablish sufficient evidence that he took responsible action to address those debts. \nApplicant also has other, unalleged debts on more recent credit reports that he has not \naddressed. He did not establish that any Guideline F mitigating conditions should apply \nto mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

Applicant effectively denied them all in his SOR response. \nThese alleged offenses are established by the record evidence, whether by Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations about them or by reference in his criminal record. All of the offenses are \nquite old. Some are more serious than others. Most are mitigated by the passage of \ntime, as discussed below. Several might have been alleged under either Guideline G \n(alcohol consumption) or Guideline J (criminal conduct). AG \u00b616(c) applies to the \nallegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s alleged offenses were minor and need not have been \ndisclosed on his SCA. The exceptions are the DUIs in 2005 and 2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.k). Applicant acknowledged the 2005 DUI arrest for refusing a breathalyzer. He \nasserted that the 2008 DUI is related to that charge but it is not established that they are \nthe same offense. Applicant had a duty to disclose both on his 2019 SCA under the \n\u201cHave you ever been charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs\u201d question and \ndid not do so. His explanation that he did not believe he had to report offenses that did \nnot result in a conviction is not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.n. \nApplicant also failed to disclose any delinquent debts on his SCA, in answer to \nquestions calling for disclosure of that information. AG \u00b6 16(a) also applies to SOR \u00b6 \n1.o. \nPerhaps most troubling, the record supports a conclusion that Applicant \nrepeatedly failed to acknowledge either any criminal offenses or arrests during his \nbackground interview (even offenses that need not have been disclosed on the SCA), \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nHe repeatedly cited his brother as the one responsible for many of the offenses, when \nthe record said otherwise. He also repeatedly failed to acknowledge any delinquent \ndebts until he was confronted about them by the interviewer. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m are mitigated by the passage of \ntime, under AG \u00b6 17(c) as they occurred from 14 to 28 years ago and he has no \nsubsequent charges. Some of the earlier issues are minor and occurred during his \ncollege years. The overall mitigation effect, however, is undercut by his recent, repeated \nfalse statements and refusals to accept responsibility for his actions and his debts, \nespecially during the security clearance process. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c) and 17(d) do not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s long career in \nhis field and the fact that he has been commended at work. But Applicant\u2019s established \nlack of candor about his criminal record and his debts outweighs this evidence. He also \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns about his financial \nsituation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on \nApril 26, 2021, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals. After a delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \ncase was assigned to me on July 21, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened on September 22, 2022.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He took some college courses, but has not earned a \ndegree. He was married in 2007 and divorced in 2012. He has three minor children with \nhis first wife. He was married again in 2016, and divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2020. \nHe served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1999-2003, and in the Army National Guard \nfrom 2003-2020. He received an honorable discharge. He has worked as a senior \nfinancial analyst for a defense contractor since early 2021. He previously worked in \nfinance as a Federal Government employee from 2007-2018. (Tr. 23-27, 39-40; GE 1) \nApplicant was deployed with his military unit from August 2016 through September \n2017. He married his girlfriend of about four years a few months prior to deployment. He \nclaims that before leaving, he signed a power of attorney so that she could file their joint \ntax return while he was away. He stated that while overseas he was told by military \nleadership that he was not required to file his tax returns until after he came home, and \nthat there was an additional grace period to file after he came back. (Tr. 28-31, 67; AE A) \nDuring his deployment, Applicant\u2019s wife filed for separation and divorce, and \nabandoned the home that he owned. He reported that when he returned in September \n2017, he found his home in a serious state of disrepair. After she absconded, pipes froze, \nwhich created leaks and holes in the ceiling and floors. His vehicle was left non-operable, \nwith mold growing on the inside and requiring major repairs. He also found that she had \ndrained the money in their joint bank account. He stated that he was not spending money \nwhile on deployment, so he had not been checking his account balance. He later found \nout that she did not file their taxes while he was away. (Tr. 28-31, 33-34, 71-72; AE A) \nThese unfiled federal and state income tax returns are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nApplicant stated that the divorce was not amicable, and caused him considerable \ndepression and stress. He reported that he moved to a new location to get away from the \narea where they used to live for his mental health, and he had to considerably downsize \nhis possessions. Some of his tax documentation was lost in the move, and some mail \nwas not preserved for him while he was deployed. He stated that he became severely \ndepressed and distressed when he tried to prepare his tax returns from this time period \n(2016-2018), because it made him think about the failed relationship and a very difficult \ntime in his life. He asserted that he had some kind of PTSD from these events. Further \ncomplicating his efforts, he found out that his wife had filed her taxes separately for these \ntax years. He claimed that he needed to know if she itemized the deductions on her \nreturns, so he could make the same selection, or the returns would be rejected.

These attempts were made during the pandemic, when \nthere was reduced staffing. He was able to file his federal and state income tax returns in \n2021, but they were not processed by the IRS for about a year because of reduced \nstaffing. His IRS tax account records show that he filed his 2016 and 2017 returns on \nApril 30, 2021, and his 2018 return on May 4, 2021. There is no balance due for these \nyears. IRS account records also show that he timely filed his 2019-2021 returns, and \nthere is no balance due for these years. (Tr. 35-36; AE I, J, K, N, M, R) \nThe IRS account records for 2016-2018 show that part of Applicant\u2019s refunds for \nthese years were transferred out to pay tax debts from 2012 and 2013. He reported that \nhe did not withhold enough from his salary during these years, which resulted in a tax \ndebt. He had been paying these debts on a payment plan. His 2012 account records \nshow that the debt originated at about $5,400, which he made monthly payments from \n2013-2021. His 2013 account records show that the debt originated at about $7,400, \nwhich he made monthly payments from 2014 to 2020. Both debts were paid through the \npayment plan and the transferring of his yearly refunds, and are now resolved. (Tr. 46-\n49, 75; AE P, Q) \nApplicant reported that he filed his 2016-2018 state tax returns at the same time \nas his federal returns. State tax records show that he made about $200 in monthly tax \npayments in December 2021, and January and February 2022. He paid the remaining \nbalance on his state tax account, about $5,400, in July 2022. The state tax debt is now \nresolved. (Tr. 54-56; AE S, T) \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows that he and his wife\u2019s finances are stable and they are \nable to afford their monthly expenses. Their current monthly income exceeds their \nexpenses by about $12,000. Records also show that he is current with his child support \nobligations. (AE O, U, V) \nAfter returning to the U.S. in August 2017, but before returning home, Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment (NJP) from his command for violating equal \nemployment opportunity (EEO) standards of conduct with a subordinate service member, \nwhile intoxicated off-duty. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) For the NJP, he was orally reprimanded and \nforfeited $1,925 in pay. He claimed that the night before the unit was scheduled to return \nhome, he was out with friends on base for dinner and a few drinks. He reported that during \nthe evening, one friend, who was junior in rank, was acting rude and belligerent towards \nhim. He claimed that he pulled him aside in view of others, to talk with him and find out \nwhat the problem was between them. He stated that after the conversation they shook \nhands. He claimed that the next day, the soldier reported to command that he made a \nracial and homophobic slur towards him, and was inappropriately calling him names. \nApplicant denied these allegations. He stated that he was unable to return home with his \nunit because an investigation needed to be completed.

He asserted that the alleged incident was over \nfive years ago, and that he served in his unit without problem for three years afterwards, \nand was honorably discharged. (Tr. 31-35, 56-66, 76-77; AE A) \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation, all of which state that he is a \ngood employee and soldier, and that he is reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold a security \nclearance. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the tax records, and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (f) apply.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s tax filing delinquencies began when he was \ndeployed overseas and in an unstable relationship. His delinquent tax returns are limited \nto those tax years (2016-2018). He has filed his delinquent federal and state tax returns \nand resolved any outstanding tax debts. His returns for the last three tax years have been \ntimely. The issue started about six years ago, and occurred under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant was deployed and unable to file his 2016 return, and \nhis second wife did not provide him with documentation and information he required to \nfile his 2017 and 2018 returns. Additionally, the aftermath of his deployment and their \nrelationship caused further personal hardship, which inhibited the timeline of his filing. \nThese were circumstances beyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by filing his returns. \nApplicant had been on a payment plan with the IRS since 2013 to resolve his \noutstanding tax debt.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (g) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nresources; \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nThe offense alleged in the NJP occurred over five years ago, under unusual \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgement. Applicant denies the behavior, and stated that he agreed \nto the NJP because he wanted to return home after his deployment. There was no \nevidence that Applicant has a history of rule violations, inappropriate behavior with \nsubordinates, or EEO violations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have considered his letters of recommendation and his military \nservice. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

See DoEd website, \u201cOne-time Federal Student Loan Debt Relief,\u201d \navailable at https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-\ninfo. (HE 6)The federal courts issued a stay on this $10,000 debt relief. The President \nrepeatedly extended the deferment. \nThe federal government\u2019s Income-Based Repayment (IBR) is a program that caps \na creditor\u2019s monthly student-loan payment based on income, and then forgives whatever \nis still owed after 20 or 25 years. The monthly payments are revised on an annual basis \nunder the category of Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE). Under the REPAYE and IBR \nplans, borrowers provide information about their income, and the student-loan creditor \ndetermines the amount they can pay under a formula provided by the DoEd. For married \nborrowers, the income and student-loan debt of both spouses is considered together to \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermine the monthly payment (with limited exceptions).

If \nyou\u2019re not a new borrower, your monthly payment amount under the IBR Plan \nis 15 percent of your discretionary income. \nExample \n\u2022 You are single and your family size is one. You live in one of the 48 \ncontiguous states or the District of Columbia. Your AGI is $40,000. \n\u2022 You have $45,000 in eligible federal student loan debt. \n\u2022 150 percent of the 2022 HHS Poverty Guideline amount for a family of one \nin the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia is $20,385. The \ndifference between your AGI and 150 percent of the Poverty Guideline amount \nis $19,615. This is your discretionary income. \n\u2022 If you\u2019re repaying under the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, or (if you\u2019re a new \nborrower) the IBR Plan, the calculation works like this: 10 percent of your \ndiscretionary income is $1,961.50. Dividing this amount by 12 results in a \nmonthly payment of $163.45. \n\u2022 If you are repaying under the IBR Plan and you\u2019re not a new borrower, the \ncalculation works like this: 15 percent of your discretionary income is \n$2,942.25, and dividing this amount by 12 results in a monthly payment of \n$245.19. (HE 7) \nOn August 24, 2022, the White House announced a new plan to assist student-\nloan borrowers: \nMake the student-loan system more manageable for current and future \nborrowers by: \nCutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The Department \nof Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment plan that protects \nmore low-income borrowers from making any payments and caps monthly \npayments for undergraduate loans at 5% of a borrower\u2019s discretionary \nincome\u2014half of the rate that borrowers must pay now under most existing \nplans. This means that the average annual student-loan payment will be \nlowered by more than $1,000 for both current and future borrowers. \nSee \u201cFACT SHEET: President Biden Announces Student Loan Relief for Borrowers Who \nNeed \nIt \nMost,\u201d \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-\nborrowers-who-need-it-most/.

(HE 10) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He has made progress \naddressing his debts. He has an established payment plan with the IRS, and he plans to \nobtain a payment plan from DoED for his student loans as soon as the deferment ends. \nHe set aside $4,500 to help with his student loans once the payments resume. He is \nmaking payments on the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He and his spouse had an AGI of about \n$140,000 annually in 2018, and his pay has been increasing. He and his spouse are able \nto address their debts and establish their financial responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were being paid through garnishment from about 2018 \nuntil the federal deferment in 2020. Payment of a debt \u201cthough garnishment rather than a \nvoluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) \n(payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial \nconsiderations concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, \n2011) (garnished payments towards delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in \nlight of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding \nthe case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an Internal Revenue \nService garnishment, \u201cOn its face, satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary \nestablishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith \ninitiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d). I have credited Applicant with mitigation of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and his student-loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.j; however, \nApplicant loses some mitigating credit because he did not clearly establish that he \nvoluntarily repaid these debts. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2015 through \n2018.

Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant filed his overdue federal income tax returns within six \nweeks of completion of his SCA, but before he received the SOR. He established a \npayment plan in 2019 to address the federal tax debt, and his failure to timely ---\npay his \nfederal tax debt is mitigated. He filed his overdue state income tax returns in 2020. \nHowever, the Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal [or state] tax problem, and the fact that \n[a]pplicant is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude \ncareful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely pay \nfederal income taxes when due. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June \n15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct \nand employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of \naccess to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of \nthe SOR).  \nUnder all the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2018 are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old nuclear engineer who has worked for his current \nemployer since 1999. In 2000, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering \ntechnology, and in 2013, he received a master\u2019s degree in divinity. He served in the Navy \nfrom 1988 to 1994, and his specialty was nuclear electrician\u2019s mate. He received an \nhonorable discharge from the Navy as a petty officer second class. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. He \nadmitted that he made financial errors; he intends to learn from those mistakes; and he \npromised not to repeat them. He has been making progress on his finances. He has \nprovided contributions to his employer and the national defense. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2018. His failure to take timely, \nprudent, responsible, good-faith actions from 2016 to 2019 (when those tax returns were \ndue) to get his tax returns timely filed raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely filing his tax returns, he \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

He has also not explained why the \nPlan did not pay all of his debts by the end of 2022 or provide an update on the status of \nthe Plan or whether he is still making payments into the Plan.

He pays \nthe debt-consolidation company $540 per month, and the Plan will continue for 36 \nmonths, or until July 2021. (GE 5 at 2.) \nApplicant submitted no documentation or additional information concerning his \ndebts or current income. The Government\u2019s 2022 Credit Report is the most recent \ninformation available in the record. The record evidence reflects that SOR debts 1.c, 1.e, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l remain unpaid. Except as noted, Applicant provided no information \ndetailing his plans for resolving his outstanding delinquent debts or demonstrating other \nindicia of trustworthiness and good judgment. In addition, I am unable to make a credibility \nassessment as Applicant elected not to have a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred at least $17,000 in past-due accounts over the last four or five \nyears that remain unresolved. These debts establish the application of the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns. \nThe guideline lists the following five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence does not fully establish any of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant incurred credit-card debt to finance the start-up of a business venture. He \nobtained some financial assistance from the debt-consolidation company and appears to \nhave attempted to act responsibly by paying some of his debts. He provided no \ninformation as to whether his payments were made through the Plan or directly by \nApplicant. He advised in his background interview that his debt payments under the Plan \nwould be completed by July 2021, and he updated that information in his Answer writing \nthat his debt payments would be completed by year-end 2022. The 2022 Credit Report \nreflects that as of November 29, 2022, he still had a significant number of unpaid debts. \nApplicant did not provide any updated information when given the opportunity to \nrespond to the FORM. There are no clear indications that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare being resolved or are under control. Similarly, there is insufficient information to \nestablish that he is adhering to a good-faith effort to deal with his overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve his outstanding debts. Lastly, Applicant has disputed some of his debts, \nbut he failed to provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of the disputes or \nprovide evidence of actions to resolve the issues. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s behavior is unlikely to recur. Overall, his management of his \nfinances casts doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his past-due indebtedness. Financial irresponsibility is \nlikely to continue, and the potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains \nundiminished. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance \nat the present time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g through 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports (Items 4~6), establish \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has about $39,158 in past-due debts that he has \nyet to address. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set \nout in the SOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has failed to address any of his admitted past-\ndue indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information.

On \nApril 15, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F.

On January 18, 2023, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nMarch 1, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or any documentary evidence. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on March 8, 2023. \nI kept the record open after the hearing to enable Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AE-A (certificate of completion), AE-B (Derivative \nClassification), AX-C (Cybersecurity Awareness), AE-D (DoD Annual Awareness \nRefresher), and AE-E (Initial Orientation and Awareness Training), which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record closed on March 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.g, and 1.j. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h-1.i.

He left his position for a higher paying position with his sponsor in \nOctober 2022. His new salary is approximately $15,000 more than his previous salary. \n(Tr. at 25-26.) \nApplicant testified he is the subject of two separate court orders. One order is for \n$2,000 for his children from a prior relationship. (Tr. at 22 and GE-5 at 7.) The other order \nfor $5,040 covers his children from his marriage and alimony. (GE-7.) He was not \nrepresented by counsel at his divorce. (Tr. at 74.) His former spouse was awarded half of \nhis retired pay in their divorce. (Tr. 25-26.) He receives approximately $631 a month in \nmilitary retired pay after withholdings. (Tr. at 27.) He also receives a $2,500 monthly \nveteran disability payment. (Tr. at 27.) He has been working side jobs to add an additional \n$2,000 a month to his income. He acknowledged he had about $8,600 in monthly income \nand had to pay $7,000 in child support and alimony each month before expenses. (Tr. at \n63.)

He admitted he hadn\u2019t taken any actions yet on the debt. \n(Tr. at 40 and GE-8 at 6.) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: past-due account referred for collection for $8,521. Applicant took \nout a personal loan in 2016-2017 for $10,000, when he fell behind on his finances. He \ntestified he tried to pay it back. (Tr. at 44.) He stopped making payments sometime in \n2017. Since 2017 he has not taken any action. (Tr. at 47 and GE-8 at 8.) This debt is not \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: past-due account charged off in the amount of $4,263. Applicant \ntook out a personal loan in 2016\u20132017 after he fell behind on his rent. (Tr. at 49.) He could \nnot recall when he stopped making payments, because \u201cit\u2019s been that long.\u201d (Tr. at 50.) \nHe acknowledged receiving notices but not taking any action (Tr. at 50 and GE-8 at 7.) \nThis debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: past-due account charged off the amount of $3,195. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit card became delinquent in 2019 after he became \u201coverextended slightly.\u201d (Tr. at \n51.) He admitted he had not taken action on this debt since 2019. (Tr. at 51 and GE-8 at \n8.) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: past-due account charged off the amount of $906. Applicant denied \nthis account, testifying he had paid it off in 2019. He did not have documentation to \nsupport his testimony, but Department Counsel noted the account was not on the most \nrecent credit report, GX8. (Tr. at 52.) I have resolved this debt in Applicant\u2019s favor because \nthe absence of this debt from his recent credit report, corroborated in part by Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony that he paid it. This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: past-due account charged off the amount of $611. Applicant \nadmitted this debt but testified he paid when he got his first job in 2019. He identified the \nspecific branch he went to and paid it with a check. (Tr. at 52.) He explained he paid the \nsmaller debts whenever he had a little bit of extra money. The most recent credit report \nshows the same outstanding balance and a last payment date of December 2019. (Tr. at \n53 and GE-8 at 7.) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: past-due account charged off the amount of $446. Applicant could \nnot recall what the debt was for. (Tr. at 53 and GE-3 at 2.) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: past-due cellular service account referred for collection for \n$1,090. Applicant offered nothing to support his denial. (GE-4 at 6 and GE-5 at 6.) This \ndebt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: past-due account referred fo\n \nr collection for $632.

Applicant\u2019s child support \ngarnishment was triggered when his wage withholding stopped after he moved and \nchanged jobs. He has since coordinated with his employers to avoid payments being \ninterrupted. (Tr. at 42-43 and GE-7 at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant admitted in his Answer to being counseled in August 2021 \nfor leaving overnight an unsecured a binder containing a password to a classified system.\n(GE-6 at 1.) He provided the training certificates he completed to mitigate his error. (AE-\nA through AE-E.) After the incident, Applicant stayed on with the company for almost a\nyear before leaving to take a higher paying position. (Tr. at 25-26.) \n \n \nApplicant testified he filed his 2021 taxes and owed $14,000. He could not afford \nto pay the tax bill. (Tr. at 66.) He was not aware of his tax withholding or reporting \nrequirements for the side jobs he held as an independent contractor. He has not contacted \nthe IRS to establish a payment plan. (Tr. at 69, 74.) He testified he was in a car accident \nand his car was severely damaged. He stopped making payments on the auto loan when \nhe could not afford the $2,500 insurance deductible. The account was charged off for \n$11,815 in April 2022. (Tr. at 53 and GE-8 at 10.) None of these debts were alleged in \nthe SOR. I have considered the evidence of these delinquent debts for the limited \npurposes of deciding which adjudicative guidelines are applicable, evaluating evidence \nof mitigation, and as part of my whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's debts are numerous, recent, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and subsequent support \norders have placed him in a very difficult financial situation. He does not support his \ntestimony that he paid the debts he denied. He has stopped making payments on his \noutstanding debts in order to comply with his child support orders and spousal support \norder. AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d His intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant has complied with the court orders \nand coordinated with his employer\u2019s payroll office to insure no further disruptions in \nsupport payments. He did not provide evidence to support his denial or assertions that he \nhad paid the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f, SOR \u00b6 1.h, or SOR \u00b6 1.i. He has not entered \ninto payment plans for the remaining debts, and he only makes payments when he has a \nlittle extra money. Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a credit report by the passage of \ntime is not a factor in an applicant's favor. See ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJun. 4, 2001). \nGuideline K:  Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe disqualifying condition relevant to this case is: \nAG \u00b6 34(g): any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor other sensitive information. \nThe relevant mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 are: \n(a): \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities. \nI conclude that these mitigating conditions are established. This was an isolated \nincident and unlikely to recur. Applicant responded favorably to counseling and remedial \nsecurity training and remained employed with the company until he left to take a higher \npaying position. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n        \n                   \n                                              \n             \n            \n                                              \n  \n \n \n                     \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nApplicant was very credible in his testimony and demonstrated initiative by taking \non additional work to improve his financial situation as well as meeting his training \nrequirements after his mishandling of a classified item. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and K and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor \nof national security, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about \nfinancial considerations. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about \nhandling protected information. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.e: \n       Subparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \n        Subparagraph 1.j:   \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n For Applicant \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant explained that in 2015 he learned that, as a \nsubcontractor, he was not paid the prevailing wage that employees of the prime \ncontractor were being paid. Rather than seeking legal advice, Applicant stated that he \nbrought this discrepancy to the attention of his employer. He continued to work his 40 \nhours with the understanding that he would be made whole. (SOR Answer) Applicant \nclaims that he was \u201clet go\u201d versus being fired as a result of complaining to his employer \nabout the wage discrepancy. (SOR Answer; Tr. 24-26) \nApplicant further stated, based on his information and belief, that his former \nemployer had not published employee standard operating procedures, a manual, or \nrules. He was supervised by the prime contractor and his use of the employer-issued \ncell phone was very informal. He claimed that he received no counseling or reprimands \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was never told he was fired.

[Note \u2013 as described supra, he married in 2019 \nand he was fired in 2015.] Applicant added that his former employer had every reason \nto disparage his character after he left the company because if he reported this pay \ndiscrepancy it would undermine any claim his employer might make of being unaware of \nthe pay discrepancy, and his employer\u2019s state taxes would not increase if Applicant \nwere fired for cause. (SOR Answer) The following contains references to Applicant\u2019s \nSOR Answer as well as references from the transcript. \nApplicant claims he \u201cdid not get the impression he was fired for misconduct or \nabuse of company property.\u201d He stated that he was neither counseled nor written up for \nmisuse of company property nor for any other misconduct. Applicant remembers being \ntold that he was being \u201clet go\u201d in part because his employer was having financial \ndifficulty and could not afford to pay the prevailing wage to everyone. Applicant\u2019s \nemployer gave him a check for \u201caround $3,000,\u201d which he did not agree with and \nwalked out, not the other way around.

He does not come into the office to clock in for his shift, but \ninstead has a company issued mobile device with our time tracking \nplatform installed. This is how he clocks in and out for his shift and lunch \nperiod. At no point in his employment with our company that it has been \napproved to \u201cskip\u201d or work through such lunch or break periods. \nAttached to this letter are a few incidents of proof we found of his activities \nof misconduct during work hours and misuse of his company issued \nmobile device, as well as location and time stamps of when he stated he \nwas at work but in fact left hours prior. Unfortunately, we have over 500 \npages of proof showing misconduct. (GE 4) \nApplicant stated that he did not tell the EDD that he had been fired.

(Tr. 53-54) \nApplicant claimed that he was authorized to use the company-issued mobile \nphone during non-working hours. He further claimed that all employees used their \ncompany-issued mobile phones for personal use during and after working hours (SOR \nAnswer; Tr. 27-29) \nAs to \u201cpersonal activities\u201d during working hours, his employer referred to text \nmessages between Applicant and female friends in a different state. Some of those \ntexts were during working hours, but his employer alleged these were Craigslist girls he \nmet for \u201cinterludes.\u201d Applicant asserts this allegation is \u201cunequivocally false and denied.\u201d \nHe concedes he engaged in personal conduct during working hours but denied that it \never interrupted his commitment to his job and that it was minor and likely during \nbreaks. (SOR Answer; Tr. 28) \nApplicant acknowledged that his employer provided employees with GPS \ncapabilities on their cell phones to help track them on the jobsite. He added \u201cthat wasn\u2019t \nup front of what it was for . . . .\u201d With company-issued cell phones, employees were able \nto clock in and out of work. Employees would typically report directly to the jobsite. (Tr. \n41-43) \nApplicant testified that it would not surprise him that his former employer\u2019s vice \npresident told the OPM investigator that when he turned his company cell phone in, they \ndiscovered ads for Craigslist and Backpage. This would not surprise him because at the \ntime he was dating and that was nothing to lie about. (Tr. 43) When asked whether it \nwould surprise him that the vice president told the OPM investigator that they were able \nto see that Applicant was meeting up with these individuals at his residence during the \nworkday, Applicant replied, \u201cI would say that\u2019s B.S.\u201d (Tr. 44-45) Applicant testified that \nhe thought the vice president\u2019s reporting his Craigslist activity during working hours to \nthe OPM investigator was \u201c[a] hundred percent\u201d untruthful. (Tr. 44) Applicant stated his \ninteraction with the company vice president was \u201cvery minimal.\u201d (Tr. 44) Applicant does \nnot recall being shown proof of his Craigslist meetings at home during working hours \nwhen he was fired by his employer, stating, \u201cAt the time, it was a little heated at that \ntime.\u201d (Tr. 44-46) He does not remember the vice president walking him to the door on \nthe day he was fired. (Tr. 46) \nWhen asked whether he was told he was being let go, Applicant responded, \n\u201cYeah. And they literally tossed me a check in an envelope and said, here, we\u2019re letting \nyou go.\u201d (Tr. 47) When queried further after acknowledging the foregoing and asked \nhow he was not under the impression he was not being fired that day, Applicant \nresponded, \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been fired before, but usually \u2013 I mean, when someone \nhands you a check and says, we\u2019re letting you go \u2013 I mean now that maybe I look back \nonto it and as I\u2019m older, yeah. But then, no. I mean I didn\u2019t take it as being fired. I mean, \nI\u2019ve never been in that situation where someone hands you money and said, here. \nHere\u2019s you know, three or five grand.

(Tr. 48) \nAs to falsifying time sheets, Applicant claimed that he was authorized to remain \nclocked-in if the deviation from work was minor or not significant enough in time or \nmanner to require clocking in or out. Applicant stated that he was authorized to work off-\nsite, and when he was off-site, he was working. He claimed that his employer told \nemployees to put 7.5 hours into the system unless they were directed otherwise. (SOR \nAnswer: Tr. 31-32) \nAs to the allegation that Applicant exchanged marijuana in the workplace, he \nclaims to be \u201ctaken aback and shocked\u201d by this allegation. He \u201cwholeheartedly denied \ndoing so.\u201d As marijuana was illegal in his state of residence in 2016, Applicant opines \nthat this allegation undercuts his employer\u2019s allegation that they did not report it and \nkept him employed. (SOR Answer; Tr. 29-30) When questioned during his hearing \nabout reports of him exchanging marijuana on the jobsite, Applicant stated that he had \nno idea of how such reports could be made. It would surprise him to learn that his \nemployer\u2019s vice president overheard him telling the receptionist that he liked to smoke \nmarijuana. Applicant stated that if the vice president told the OPM investigator that, she \nwould be lying. (Tr. 49-50) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that when Applicant completed his April 5, 2018 SF-86, he \nfalsified his answer to Section 13C \u2013 Employment Record by answering \u201cno\u201d when \nasked whether in the last seven years had he been fired from a job. Applicant denied \nthis allegation. (SOR Answer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that when Applicant completed his April 5, 2018 SF-86, he \nfalsified his answer to Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities # Name of Employer \nReason for Leaving Question for this employment by answering \u201cno\u201d when asked \nwhether in the last seven years he had received a written warning, been officially \nreprimanded, suspended or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a \nviolation of security policy. Applicant denied this allegation. (SOR Answer) \nWith regard to these falsification allegations, Applicant stated that unfortunately \nhe rushed to complete his SF-86 because he was \u201con the clock\u201d at his employer and \nhastily responded thinking his unique circumstances did not fit neatly into the \nparameters of the question. He conceded that he should have asked someone and as a \nresult answered no. Applicant testified that he thought he was being truthful when he \nstated that he had never been fired. (SOR Answer; Tr. 37-40) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted four work-related character letters from individuals who \nlauded his performance and supported him being granted a clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct may be a security concern, stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior . . . ; (2) any . . . inappropriate behavior; and (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant engaged in a series of misconduct in 2015 that \nled to him being terminated, i.e. being fired, and later falsified his 2018 SF-86 regarding \nhim being fired.

On one hand he acknowledged being \u201clet go\u201d and given \nseverance pay but does not acknowledge being \u201cfired.\u201d Applicant\u2019s grasp of the English \nlanguage and situational awareness is such that it was implausible for him to conclude \nthat being \u201clet go\u201d was anything other than being fired for misconduct. Furthermore, to \naccept Applicant\u2019s versions of the facts, his employer would have had to have gone \nthrough great lengths to create a false record as justification for firing him for \nmisconduct. This misconduct was later reported to the state EDD and OPM. \nWhen Applicant completed his 2018 SF-86, he claimed that he was on the clock \nand rushed. He had prior experience completing an SF-86 when he was denied a \nclearance in 2017. Applicant persisted in perpetuating the false narrative surrounding \nhis 2015 termination throughout the entire security clearance application process to \ninclude his OPM interview, SOR response, and his hearing testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \n16(b), and 16(c) are established, as well as the general concern discussed in AG \u00b6 15. \nAs noted, I find Applicant\u2019s explanations are not credible with regard to the allegations \nhe denied. Accordingly, I further find that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are established. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nAG \u00b6 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has\nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing\nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind\nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under\nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to\npresent evidence to explain the omission.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). In August 2015, Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment for misconduct.  His misconduct is described in further detail supra. In April \n2018, Applicant responded to the questions on his SF-86 about whether he had ever \nbeen fired in the last seven years, and he claimed that he had not been fired. He \ndeliberately failed to disclose a truthful account, i.e. that he was fired, and he failed to \nlist any of the circumstances surrounding his being fired. He provided false information \nwhen he verified the accuracy of the false information he provided on his April 2018 SF-\n86, and again during his 2019 OPM interview.  \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to provide accurate information \nduring his 2019 OPM interview, when he confirmed information in his SF-86 that he was \nnot fired or surrounding circumstances about being fired. Applicant\u2019s provision of false \ninformation during his OPM interview will not be considered for disqualification \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurposes; however, it will be considered for the five purposes cited, infra. In ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014)). The \nnon-SOR-alleged falsification will not be considered except for the five purposes listed \nabove. \nA false statement during the security clearance process increases the risk that an \napplicant will not provide accurate information about other issues of security concern or \nrehabilitative efforts. See ISCR Case No. 22-00657 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 18, 2023) \n(discussing impact of false statements on SF-86s in assessment of credibility of \napplicant\u2019s statements about current and future marijuana use). Applicant knowingly and \nintentionally falsified his SF-86 with intent to deceive. None of the mitigating conditions \nwere established. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility \u201cmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments \nunder Guideline E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nApplicant is a 38-year-old engineer technician seeking a Secret security \nclearance. He had previously applied for a clearance in 2017, which was denied. He is a \nhigh school graduate. Applicant produced favorable employment evidence since he was \nfired in 2015, has married, and has four children for whom he provides financial support. \nIt appears that he has made considerable headway in advancing his career since 2015. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this \ntime. In August 2015, Applicant was fired for misconduct. In 2018, he completed and \nfalsified an SF-86 denying that he was fired in 2015 and failed to describe the reasons \nfor the firing. He persisted in that false narrative during his 2019 OPM interview, in his \n2023 SOR Answer, and during his hearing testimony. \nAn honest and candid self-report of security-relevant personal information is an \nimportant indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the \nrecord discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate personal \nconduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase, including FORM Items 1 through 8, on August 26, 2022. On September 12, 2022, \nDOHA sent a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant, who was \ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on September 24, 2022, and \nsubmitted a Response comprised of a statement and a letter (previously submitted with \nhis Answer to the SOR) confirming he had successfully completed an outpatient treatment \nprogram for addiction. The letter will identified as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 23, 2023. The SOR and the answer, (FORM \nItems 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. FORM Items 3 through 8 and AE1 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \nAmendment to the SOR \nAs originally drafted, the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.c read as follows: \n3.c. Information as set forth in subparagraphs 2.b through 3.a. above. \nThe copy of the SOR in the file (Item 1) contains a handwritten edit to SOR \u00b6 3.a, \nwhereby the reference to subparagraph \u201c3.a\u201d is crossed out, and a reference to \nsubparagraph \u201c2.d\u201d is inserted instead. (Item 1) The Government\u2019s FORM does not \nmention this proposed amendment. \nHowever, upon review, the reference in SOR \u00b6 3.c to \u201csubparagraph 3.a\u201d is clearly \nerroneous, since it would be unnecessary to cross-allege an allegation already addressed \nunder the same guideline. In addition, SOR \u00b6 3.c is a cross-allegation, so Applicant has \nalready admitted or denied the underlying conduct. He also incorporated his answer to \nSOR \u00b6 3.b. (also a cross-allegation).

A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must\npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue\neligibility for assignment to a public trust position. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 22: \n(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \nApplicant has ongoing issues with alcohol consumption, as he incurred six alcohol-\nrelated arrests between 2013 and 2019 and violated his probation. AG \u00b6 22(a) and AG \u00b6 \n22(g) both apply. AG \u00b6 22(c) also applies, as the record evidence of the six alcohol-related \narrests supports a finding that Applicant engaged in recent, habitual consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions detailed in AG \u00b6 23 are potentially applicable: \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in \na treatment program; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along\nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established\npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations.   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first alcohol-related arrest in 2013 did not deter his behavior, as he \nincurred four more alcohol-related arrests over the next six years. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not \nestablished. \nThe record shows Applicant eventually completed his required courses, including \nmost recently in February 2021. While he declared his intent to refrain from alcohol abuse \nhis alcohol issues are too recent and too serious to be considered mitigated. AG \u00b6 23(b) \nis only partially established. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) are partially established. Even though Applicant recently \ncompleted a comprehensive substance abuse treatment program there is evidence of \nfailing to comply with court-ordered programs. His alcohol related arrests are recent and \nongoing. His overall pattern and history of alcohol-related issues are too recent for the \nabove mitigating conditions to fully apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nestablish that the security concern regarding his history of problematic alcohol \ninvolvement is mitigated. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe record establishes use of marijuana in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also establishes \nthat he used cocaine in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and was arrested and convicted twice \npossession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n            \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,  \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of    \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26: \n (f)\n \n \n                 \n             \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana may have ended in \n2015. However, he was arrested in 2019 for marijuana possession and subsequently \ntested positive for cocaine in 2019 while on probation. This makes his drug involvement \nmore recent. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant declared determination to lead a life \ndedicated to the betterment of myself and the people around him. He provided evidence \nto support this declaration. However, his issues with illegal drugs are too recent and too \nserious to be considered mitigated. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nestablish that the security concern regarding his drug involvement is mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \n\u00b6 31: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a  \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant\u2019s five alcohol-related convictions and two drug possession convictions \nare cross-alleged under the criminal conduct guideline. He admitted the conduct involving \npointing a laser at a police officer. He was cited for a probation violation. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply for the same reasons set forth under Guidelines \nG and H above. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is recent and ongoing. His recent \nrehabilitative steps, completing a treatment program, and dedicating himself to leading a \nlife to the betterment of himself and the people around him are insufficient given the record \nevidence. He needs to establish a longer record of accomplishment of responsible \nbehavior and compliance with rules, regulations, and the law before his criminal conduct \ncan be considered mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, H, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, H, and J and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe trustworthiness concerns raised by his alcohol consumption, drug involvement, or \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude that he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

As he neither admitted nor denied SOR \u00b6 2.d, I construe his silence as a denial. He is 47 years old. He married in 2003, separated in 2015, and divorced in 2017.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice on August 24, 2022, scheduling the matter for a hearing on \nOctober 4, 2022. Due to Applicant\u2019s scheduling conflict, DOHA issued an amended notice \non September 23, 2022, rescheduling the hearing for October 5, 2022.

GE 7 is a July 2017 record from another U.S. government agency \n(AGA 1). GE 9 is Applicant\u2019s July 2017 signed statement. GE 10 is an October 2017 \nnotice of proposed removal from AGA 1.

Applicant objected to GE 4-5, \n7, 9, 11-12, and 14 on the basis that they contained information not relevant to the SOR. \nApplicant objected to GE 10 on the basis that the proposed removal by AGA 1 was not \neffectuated. Applicant also objected to GE 11 on the basis that it was an incomplete \ndocument, as Department Counsel did not offer its attachments into evidence. I overruled \nApplicant\u2019s objections and admitted GE 4-5, 7, 9-12, and 14 into evidence. Department \nCounsel objected to AE B on the basis that it contained information not relevant to the \nSOR. AE B is a December 2018 AGA 1 memorandum of activity. I overruled Department \nCounsel\u2019s objection and admitted AE B into evidence. \nApplicant testified. At his request, I kept the record open until October 19, 2022, \nfor additional documentation. Applicant submitted additional documentation in a timely \nmanner, which I marked collectively as AE L and admitted without objection. I marked \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter and exhibit list collectively as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nI. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 19, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c; he admitted, in part, and denied, in \npart, SOR \u00b6 2.a; and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. As he neither admitted nor denied \nSOR \u00b6 2.d, I construe his silence as a denial. He is 47 years old. He married in 2003, \nseparated in 2015, and divorced in 2017. He has three children; one is an adult and two \nare minors. According to his December 2019 security clearance application (SCA), he \nhas owned his home in state A since May 2003.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.d) It also alleged \nthat he failed to file, as required, his state income tax returns for at least TY 2012 and \n2013. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.d) These SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his Answer; his SCA; his background interviews from 2015 and 2020; his \nresponse to interrogatories; tax account transcripts; bankruptcy records; court records; \nand a 2021 credit bureau report. (Answer; GE 1-6) \nThe SOR also alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant provided at least three \ncontractors with his username and password to an invoice processing platform (IPP), \nbetween approximately February 2014 and March 2017, in violation of security protocols \nwhile he was employed by AGA 1. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) It also alleged that he improperly used \nthe services of a contractor when he tasked her with his personal responsibilities, to \ninclude work related to an au pair handbook, in approximately August 2015. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIt also alleged that he falsified material facts during an interview with an authorized DOD \ninvestigator, when he stated that the AGA 1 contracting officer (CO) gave him permission \nto share his IPP credentials with his executive assistant, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. (SOR \n\u00b6 2.c) \nApplicant disclosed information about his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and failure to \ntimely file his relevant federal and state income tax returns on his SCA, during his \nbackground interviews, and in his response to interrogatories. He attributed them to \nmarital stress, his failed business with his ex-spouse, her financial mismanagement, his \nseparation and divorce, and his period of unemployment. Two substantial judgments of \n$117,707 for his business\u2019s unpaid rent and $231,940 for a business loan, were entered \nagainst Applicant and his ex-spouse\u2019s business, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. His ex-\nspouse handled the judgment-related matters and told him that the judgments were \nentered solely against their business. He was unaware that he and his ex-spouse had \npersonally guaranteed some of the contracts that resulted in the judgments, and that \nconsequently the judgments were also entered against them individually. Simultaneously, \nhe and his ex-spouse were negotiating the terms of their divorce settlement, to include \ndebt allocation. (Tr. at 56-77, 159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-247; GE 1-6) \nApplicant learned of his personal liability for the judgments in 2017, when he was\nso counseled by his attorney, and he reached out to the creditor for the larger judgment \nto try to resolve it. His wages at AGA 1 were garnished for a period to satisfy the \njudgments, but once he was separated from AGA, he no longer had the assets to continue \nhis resolution efforts. He then elected to resolve the judgments through Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Records of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy reflect that he claimed liabilities \ntotaling $818,412, which consisted primarily of business debts. He disclosed on his SCA \nthat he agreed to pay the bankruptcy trustee $18,000 over 12 months, at $1,500 monthly, \nso that he could keep his home. (Tr. at 56-77, 159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-\n247; GE 1-6) \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nDuring his period of personal and professional turmoil, Applicant was unable to \nlocate documents and obtain necessary information from his ex-spouse to timely file his \nrelevant federal and state income tax returns. His ex-spouse was an independent \ncontractor during their marriage, and he discovered that she had not been paying her \ntaxes. In addition, she wrote checks for their business without documenting them in the \nlogs. He needed to ascertain the business expenses by locating copies of the checks and \nobtaining bank statements before he could file his relevant income tax returns. In 2013, \nhe hired an accountant to file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2010 to \n2013. He indicated during his January 2020 background interview that he paid his \noutstanding federal and state taxes in 2018. He testified that his accountant electronically \nfiled his federal and state income tax returns concurrently for TY 2012 to 2014, and that \nhe did not owe any taxes for those tax years as of the date of the hearing. (Tr. at 56-77, \n159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-247; GE 1-6) \nOctober 2022 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant filed his federal \nincome tax returns for TY 2012 and 2014 in June 2020 and July 2020, respectively, and \nhe did not owe federal taxes for those tax years. An April 2022 letter from the IRS reflects \nthat the IRS accepted Applicant\u2019s August 2020 claim of identity theft pertaining to TY \n2013. The IRS noted that it received tax returns with Applicant\u2019s taxpayer ID number (TIN) \nfor TY 2013; identity theft occurred under Applicant\u2019s TIN; and the IRS removed the \nincorrect tax return information from Applicant\u2019s TIN. It instructed him that he did not need \nto take any further action. (Tr. at 68-77, 218-225, 234-238; GE 4; AE L) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s monthly income was $8,000, of which he \nreceived $4,000 from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a 100% disability \nrating. His monthly net remainder was $6,000. His 2021 credit report reflects that he had \nno delinquent debts, and he was current on his mortgage. He completed a personal \nfinancial management course and he received credit counseling through his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, in 2019. He testified that he has since timely filed his federal and state income \ntax returns and he intends to continue to do so. IRS tax account transcripts from August \n2020 reflect that he filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2015, 2016, 2018, and \n2019, and he did not owe federal taxes for those tax years. He provided documentation \nreflecting that a $2,629 tax lien, entered against him in May 2014 by state B for TY 2010, \nwas released in July 2017. He testified that he owed approximately $4,000 in state taxes \nto state A for TY 2021, and he intended to pay it. He testified that he learned a lot from \nhis experience with attempting to run a business, and \u201cI know for a fact that nothing will \never happen to my credit again.\u201d (Tr. at 76-77, 161, 176, 228-229, 233; GE 2, 4-5; AE K) \nWhen Applicant worked as a CIO for AGA 1, he was also tasked with serving as a \ncontracting officer representative (COR)--a certification he received years before he \nworked for AGA 1. He testified that he was the only CIO within AGA 1 that also was a \ndesignated COR, and that his deputy was the only other individual who was COR-\ncertified. Due to staffing shortages, AGA 1 necessitated that an executive such as himself, \nnot normally tasked with junior-level-COR responsibilities, perform the COR function. In \nhis capacity as a COR, he acted as the liaison between the CO and approximately 200 \ncontractors. He was responsible for accessing the IPP to verify that the contractors \nworked the hours claimed on their invoices, then approving their invoices in a timely \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nmanner so that they were paid.

His repeated requests for more \nCOR-certified personnel were unanswered. Unable to timely review and approve all the \ncontractors\u2019 submitted invoices while also performing his CIO duties, he sought and \nreceived authorization from an individual whom he mistakenly believed at the time to be \nthe CO, to delegate his authority and allow his executive assistants to assist him with \nreviewing the data. He did not recall this individual informing him that he could delegate \nhis authority to a back-up COR. He acknowledged that he did not explicitly inform this \nindividual that he would be giving his executive assistants access to the IPP using his IPP \ncredentials. He testified that his executive assistants reviewed the contractors\u2019 submitted \ntime and work, but only he approved the contractors\u2019 invoices. (Tr. at 85-87, 89-110, 162-\n164, 168, 176-196, 205-217, 224, 240-246; GE 1, 4, 7-14; AE A) \nApplicant denied telling a DOD background investigator, in February 2020, that the \nCO told him he could give his executive assistants his IPP credentials. He testified that \nwhen he adopted the February 2020 ROI in his response to interrogatories, he overlooked \nthe portion of the ROI in which he discussed this issue and that he should have provided \nclarification. He testified that the individual, whom he believed to be the CO, never told \nhim he could give out his IPP credentials. He acknowledged that he did and that doing so \nwas in violation of security protocols. In 2016, a CO from another U.S. government agency \n(AGA 3) learned of Applicant\u2019s executive assistants accessing the IPP using his IPP \ncredentials. That CO informed him that such a practice was impermissible and should be \nimmediately stopped, and he did so. Applicant learned, in 2017, that the individual he \nbelieved was a CO from whom he sought authorization was also a contractor. He testified \nthat he learned from this experience and intends to abide by all security protocols in the \nfuture.

He maintained that he did not task her with doing so. He testified that \nshe worked on it voluntarily after learning through his work and personal to-do lists, that \nit was a priority for him to find an au pair because he was separated from his then-spouse \nand needed childcare. He acknowledged that once she compiled the handbook, he sent \nher an email asking her to make certain changes to it. He testified that he should have \ninstructed her not to perform any tasks on his personal to-do list.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2019 because he was unable to meet his \nfinancial obligations. He also failed to timely file his relevant federal and state income tax \nreturns. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He hired an accountant in \n2013 to help him file his relevant federal and state income tax returns. In 2017, he reached \nout to the creditor and attempted to resolve the larger of the two judgments when he \nlearned that he was personally liable for them. His wages were garnished to satisfy the \njudgments until he was separated from AGA 1 in 2019. When he no longer had any assets \nto continue his own resolution efforts, he resolved the judgments through his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. In 2020, he filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2012 and 2014, and \nhe stated that he concurrently filed his state income tax returns for TY 2012 and 2013. \nHe did not owe federal or state taxes. for those tax years. In 2022, the IRS accepted his \nclaim of identity theft pertaining to TY 2013, noting that it received tax returns with \nApplicant\u2019s TIN for that tax year and he did not need to take any further action. \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder was $6,000, he \nwas current on his mortgage, and he did not have any delinquent debts. He completed a \npersonal financial management course and he received credit counseling through his \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. He testified that he has intends to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns in the future, and resolve any taxes owed. Applicant\u2019s finances, to \ninclude his tax situation, are under control, and it does not continue to cast doubt on his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) are established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s\ntime or resources; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nApplicant did not deliberately provide false information during his February 2020 \nbackground interview about his unauthorized sharing of his IPP credentials. He credibly \ntestified that when he adopted the February 2020 ROI in his response to interrogatories, \nhe overlooked the portion of the ROI in which he discussed this issue, and he should \nhave clarified that he simply sought permission from the individual whom he believed to \nbe the CO to delegate his authority to his support staff to review contractors\u2019 submitted \ntime and work. He acknowledged that this individual never told him he could give out his \nIPP credentials.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) is not established for SOR \u00b6 2.c and I find that \nallegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and his failure to timely file his relevant \nfederal and state income tax returns are discussed above in my analysis under Guideline \nF. No disqualifying conditions under Guideline E apply to the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 \n2.d, and I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant provided his IPP credentials to his contractor support staff and used a \ncontractor to perform personal tasks between 2014 and 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(1) to \n16(d)(4) are established for SOR \u00b6 2.a and 2.b. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant disclosed the information about sharing his IPP credentials with his \nsupport staff and about using a contractor to perform personal tasks, on his SCA, during \nhis background interviews, and in his response to interrogatories. He engaged in this \nconduct between 2014 and 2017, and he had no prior or subsequent conduct of a similar \nnature. He acknowledged that he violated security protocols when he shared his IPP \ncredentials with his support staff, and that he should have ensured that his support staff \ndid not perform any of his personal tasks. He credibly testified that he learned from these \nexperiences, and he intends to not repeat them in the future.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. I found Applicant to be credible and candid at the hearing. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigate the financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns. \nI have considered Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD-19), Protecting \nWhistleblowers with Access to Classified Information (October 10, 2012), Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 9 (SEAD 9), \u201cWhistleblower Protection: Appellate Review of \nRetaliation Regarding Security Clearances and Access Determinations,\u201d effective May \n28, 2022, and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3341(j)(4), and I am satisfied that the decision to deny his \nclearance was not a reprisal for protected disclosures. Applicant freely admitted the \nconduct alleged in the SOR in his Answer, SCA, background interviews, response to \ninterrogatories, and testimony at the hearing. My favorable decision in this matter also \nmoots any claim of reprisal. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 52, is a logistics planner currently employed by a federal contractor since January 2020. She served an active duty in the Army from January 1994 until she retired as an E-7 in January 2018. Her military career included five deployments. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2022. She married in 1995 and divorced in 2004. She married again in 2004 and she and her husband separated in 2019. This is her first application for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 32-36.) The SOR alleges 22 delinquent accounts totaling $56,564. The debts are comprised of delinquent credit-card accounts. Applicant admits each of the debts and states that she has resolved each of them either through 1099-Cs with her 2019/2020 federal tax returns or directly with the creditors. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s January 2022, October 2020, and January 2020 credit-bureau reports (CBR). (GX 5; GX 4; GX 3.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose in 2016 when she returned from a deployment. She received her pay, paid her ongoing financial obligations, and spent the remaining money. She was then paid a second time for the same pay period. She contacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and wanted to return the money in a lump-sum. However, DFAS would not permit her to do so. Instead, DFAS prorated the repayment over a three-month period. While Applicant and her husband d",

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 6, 2022, \nand the case was assigned to me on April 8, 2022. On September 30, 2022, DOHA \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for October 13, 2022. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled via Microsoft Teams video-teleconference. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified but \ndid not submit any documentary evidence. I left the record open until October 28, 2022, \nto enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. She timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A through AX K, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 52, is a logistics planner currently employed by a federal contractor \nsince January 2020. She served an active duty in the Army from January 1994 until she \nretired as an E-7 in January 2018. Her military career included five deployments. She \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2022. She married in 1995 and divorced in 2004. \nShe married again in 2004 and she and her husband separated in 2019. This is her first \napplication for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 32-36.) \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent accounts totaling $56,564. The debts are \ncomprised of delinquent credit-card accounts. Applicant admits each of the debts and \nstates that she has resolved each of them either through 1099-Cs with her 2019/2020 \nfederal tax returns or directly with the creditors. The delinquent debts are reflected in \nApplicant\u2019s January 2022, October 2020, and January 2020 credit-bureau reports (CBR). \n(GX 5; GX 4; GX 3.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose in 2016 when she returned from a \ndeployment. She received her pay, paid her ongoing financial obligations, and spent the \nremaining money. She was then paid a second time for the same pay period. She \ncontacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and wanted to return the \nmoney in a lump-sum. However, DFAS would not permit her to do so. Instead, DFAS \nprorated the repayment over a three-month period. While Applicant and her husband did \nnot share any primary banking accounts, Applicant\u2019s husband had historically contributed \nto household and other living expenses. After Applicant\u2019s husband also returned from \ndeployment in 2016, he stopped making financial contributions to the household. This \ncaused Applicant to not have enough money to meet her monthly financial obligations. \nShe asked her husband for financial assistance and he declined to contribute. The \ncombination of these events was too great a strain on Applicant\u2019s finances, and she began \nto fall behind on her consumer credit-card obligations. (Tr. 28-31; Tr. 62-64.) \nApplicant retired from the Army in January 2018. At the end of 2017, she enrolled \nin an out-of-state university because it had a program of study in logistics, and she \ncommuted to attend her classes. She initially attended classes full-time. Her income was \nher retirement and VA disability pay. While she was able to pay her living expenses and \nnot incur additional delinquent debt, she was unable to address the consumer credit-card \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt that became delinquent beginning in 2016.

She began contacting her creditors to enter repayment agreements with them. \nShe attended several credit counseling sessions on her university campus. She learned \nmethods for negotiating repayment agreements as well as how to prioritize the repayment \nof debts. Specifically, she learned the prioritizing technique of paying as many of the \nsmallest debts off as quickly as possible rather than small payments on each of the debts. \n(Tr. 51-53.) \nWhen she was hired by her current employer in January 2020, Applicant changed \nher school schedule to part-time, worked full-time as a government contractor, and \ncontinued to work part time at the local department store. She continued to work at the \ndepartment store for additional income to address her debts until it permanently closed in \nMay 2021. (Tr. 36.) \nApplicant stated that she has resolved all of the SOR debts either through \nrepayment plans or through cancellation of debt as reflected in 1099-Cs. She has not \nbeen contacted by any of her former creditors since she resolved each of the accounts. \n(Tr. 52-53.) \nWith her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided six 1099-Cs that she filed with her \n2019 Federal tax return, as required. She also submitted a 1099-C that she filed with her \n2020 federal tax return, as required. (AX E.) They correspond with the following SOR \ndebts, totaling $27,160: \n\u00b6 1.b - $3,078; \n\u00b6 1.c - $819 (AX E); \n\u00b6 1.g - $6,693; \n\u00b6 1.h - $5,849; \n\u00b6 1.i - $6,394; \n\u00b6 1.q - $2,369; \n\u00b6 1.t - $1,958. \nApplicant has provided documentation showing that she has paid the following \naccounts, totaling $14,168: \n\u00b6 1.m - $1,331 (AX B; AX J); \n\u00b6 1.o - $699 (AX G); \n\u00b6 1.p - $1,180 (AX B; AX J); \n\u00b6 1.r - $8,721 (AX A); \n\u00b6 1.v - $2,237 (AX F). \nApplicant combined the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a - $927, \u00b6 1.e \u2013 $595, \u00b6 1.j - \n$620, and \u00b6 1.k - $397, totaling $2,539.

She has not been contacted by any of her former creditors \nsince she resolved each of the accounts. (Tr. 52-57; Tr. 90-91.) \nOn the advice she received in credit counseling, Applicant has been working to \nreestablish her credit. She has opened new credit-card accounts with six of the creditors \nof the SOR debts. She was advised to maintain small balances on several accounts long \nenough for the accounts to be reported, then pay the balance of the accounts. \nAdditionally, Applicant stated that there are several circumstances, such as travel and car \nrental, where a credit card is required. (Tr. 77-81.) \nIn January 2022, Applicant\u2019s total balance on her 16 open credit-card accounts \nwas $19,014 with the highest balance on one credit card being $8,062. As of October 23, \n2022, the outstanding total balance on those same accounts is $10,602, with the highest \nbalance on one credit card being $6,988. She is current on all of her open accounts and \nhas a overall on-time payment history. Ten of the accounts have a $0 balance. (AX J; GX \n5.) \nApplicant purchased a car in May 2019 with a car-loan amount of $13,605. In \nJanuary 2021, Applicant\u2019s mother totaled her car. Applicant gave her car to her mother \nand purchased a used vehicle for herself. She has continuously made on-time payments. \nApplicant\u2019s mother also totaled Applicant\u2019s car. Applicant has continued to make on-time \npayments and the car-loan balance is now approximately $3,200. (Tr. 24; Tr. 48-49; AX \nJ.) \nSince beginning her current job, Applicant has maintained a written budget. She \nbought her house in 2014 and her October 2022 CBR shows her mortgage-loan payment \nhistory beginning in May 2015. She has never made a late payment. She refinanced her \nhouse in June 2021 at a considerably lower interest rate. Applicant uses an application \non her cell phone to monitor her accounts and her credit score. The application also \nprovides credit-management tips. Applicant is current on her ongoing financial obligations \nand has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. She has a checking account, savings \naccount, and makes contributions to a 401(k). She has a net monthly remainder. (AX J; \nTr. 49-50; Tr. 82.) \nApplicant\u2019s coworker and friend for more than ten years and considers Applicant \nto be reliable, trustworthy, and dedicated. Applicant\u2019s coworker and friend since 2015 \nconsiders Applicant to be reliable, professional, and trustworthy. She states that Applicant \nexercises good judgment and has an outstanding work ethic. Applicant was sincere and \ncredible during her testimony.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): an inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose in 2016 under unusual circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur and were largely beyond her control. Specifically, coincident with \nreceiving a duplicate payment that was deducted from her pay for three months, \nApplicant\u2019s husband stopped making any financial contributions to the household. \nApplicant was unable to maintain her consumer credit-card payments on her retirement \nand disability pay. However, she maintained her mortgage-loan payments. Applicant and \nher husband separated in 2019. \nWhile attending college, Applicant met with a credit counselor on several \noccasions and learned techniques for addressing delinquent debt. In 2018, Applicant \nbegan contacting her creditors in an effort to pay her smaller accounts and enter \nrepayment plans with the larger accounts. She received seven 1099-Cs that she filed with \nher 2019 and 2020 federal tax returns.. \nApplicant has resolved each of the debts alleged in the SOR through either \ncancellation of debt or repayment. She provided documentation showing the repayment \nof five of the SOR debts. Through the cancellation of debt and the repayment of her \naccounts, Applicant has resolved $41,328 of delinquent debt, which is greater than 73% \nof the SOR debt. She has not recently been contacted by any of the creditors of the SOR \ndebts. She has re-established credit with six of the creditors of the SOR debts. \nApplicant, on the advice of the credit counselor, has used her credit cards to \ncontinue to work on re-establishing her credit. She was advised to carry small balances, \nallow the balances to be reported on her credit reports, and then pay them. From January \n2022 until October 2022, Applicant reduced credit-card balances by more than $6,000. \nShe continues to make timely payments on all of her open accounts with balances, \nincluding her mortgage loan, and her two car loans. \nApplicant has acted in good faith in her efforts to resolve her financial \ndelinquencies. \u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish resolution of every \ndebt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Army for 24 years, including five deployments. \nShe demonstrated her dedication to continuing to serve as a civilian through her pursuit \nof a degree in logistics, the field in which she now works. She is financially stable and \nfiscally responsible. She was sincere and credible while testifying. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by her financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 28, 2022, and the hearing was \nheld as scheduled on November 16, 2022. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-3, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. Two hearing exhibits (HE I and II) \nreflecting the Governments exhibit list and discovery letter were marked accordingly. \nApplicant testified, but he did not offer any exhibits. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted some of the allegations in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand 2.b), and denied other allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.d) (He failed to admit or deny \u00b6 2.a, \nwhich is a cross-allegation of \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, under Guideline E. His admissions to the \nunderlying Guideline H allegations will also be recognized as an admission to this \nallegation). He also provided some explanation for his conduct. I adopt his admissions \nas findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is single, never has married, and has no children. \nHe has worked as a computer engineer for his current employer, a federal contractor, \nsince September 2017. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions \nof 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 6, 20; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used (from December 2012 \nto October 2019) and purchased marijuana (from December 2012 to April 2014). It also \nalleged Applicant used marijuana after being granted a security clearance in 2017. I find \nthis allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.b, is duplicative with SOR \u00b6 1.a because it alleges the same \nconduct, i.e., use of marijuana. The SOR language stating that the use was \u201cafter being \ngranted a security clearance\u201d does not equate to the disqualifying language of \u201cwhile \ngranted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d and is therefore \nsuperfluous. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged all the allegations listed above. (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a) Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately provided false \ninformation when completing his September 2019 security clearance application, \nspecifically relating to Section 23; and during his background interview with an \ninvestigator in November 2019, when he denied his marijuana use between December \n2012 and October 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.d) \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use between February 2012 and April 2014 in \nhis September 2017 SCA. He described that use as experimental and that he used \nmarijuana approximately once a week as a freshman in college. He also stated he had \nno intent to use marijuana in the future because he \u201cno longer enjoy the effects of \nmarijuana.\u201d He received his secret security clearance in approximately January 2018.

Applicant completed this SCA in September 2019. (Tr. \n20; GE 1-2) \nIn his 2019 SCA, under Section 23, Applicant denied using any illegal drugs \nwithin the past seven years and he also denied using drugs while possessing a security \nclearance. He failed to list on this SCA his drug use from December 2012 to April 2014, \nwhich he previously listed on his September 2017 SCA. These uses would fall within the \nseven-year window about which the question asked. In November 2019, Applicant was \ninterviewed by a background investigator and was asked the same two questions, i.e., \nwhether he had any involvement with illegal drugs in the last seven years and if he had \nany involvement with illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. (GE 1-2 (section 23), GE 3 (p. 7-using bottom center \npage numbers) \nThe investigator confronted Applicant with his admissions from his 2017 SCA. \nAfter being confronted, Applicant admitted to his earlier marijuana use (2012 to 2014) \nand expounded on more recent use. He described smoking marijuana in leaf form with \na water pipe at home or at parties. He used about four times annually, with his most \nrecent use in October 2019, which he claimed was also his last use. He claimed his last \npurchase of marijuana was in April 2014. He also claimed that he did not associate with \nanyone who uses drugs. He has not received any drug treatment or counseling. (GE 3 \n(p. 7)) \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use and purchase of marijuana in his SOR \nanswer. He also admitted intentionally providing false information on his 2019 SCA \nbecause he became aware that using drugs could disqualify him from holding a security \nclearance. He admitted during his testimony that he provided false information because \nhe was concerned he might lose his job if he admitted to his marijuana use. (Tr. 20, 23) \nApplicant offered the following explanation for his conduct. When he was hired in \n2017 by his defense contractor employer he claimed to have stopped using marijuana \nbecause he lived in a state where it was illegal. He was transferred to a new location \nwithin the company in August 2019. His transfer was to a state where marijuana use \nand possession is legal under state law. He began using marijuana when he arrived in \nthe new state because he claimed he was unaware that use of marijuana was illegal \nunder federal law. He further claimed that he was first made aware of the federal \nprohibition when his background investigator stated this to him in November 2019, \nwhich is when he claims he stopped using marijuana. He also claimed he could not \nremember being briefed by his employer that marijuana use was illegal under federal \nlaw and prohibited by its employees. I find these claims not credible. (Tr. 22, 30) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nApplicant used marijuana on multiple occasions between December 2012 and \nOctober 2019. He purchased marijuana between December 2012 and April 2014. I find \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \nAlthough he has held a security clearance since January 2018, there is no record \nevidence that he had access to classified information during the times he used any \nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and the granting of access to classified information are not synonymous \nconcepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is a \ndetermination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an \nindividual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified \nmaterials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also \nmust have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana was infrequent, his uses were \nas recent as 2019. It is troubling that Applicant broke the commitment he made in his \n2017 SCA not to use marijuana in the future by using marijuana when he moved to a \nstate where marijuana use is legal under state law. Despite this statement of intent not \nto use again, Applicant\u2019s short abstention is insufficient to convince me that recurrence \nis unlikely. Additionally, his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance casts \ndoubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does \nnot apply, while AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. They include: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;   \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; and \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his 2019 \nSCA and during his 2019 background investigation interview. He did so because he \nadmitted that he was afraid of losing his job if he provided the truthful details of his \nmarijuana use. Applicant\u2019s actions were deliberate. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) \nare established. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse is cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not \nperfectly applicable because the alleged conduct is sufficient and is explicitly covered \nfor an adverse determination under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nIntentionally providing false information on a SCA and to a government \ninvestigator are not a minor offenses and doing so certainly casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. His marijuana use, as recently as 2019, \nwhile holding a security clearance, and his poor judgment as demonstrated when he \nused marijuana despite his SCA written pledge not to do so also casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b617(c) does not apply. Although Applicant \nclaims he will not use marijuana in the future, he has made such a commitment in the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast, which he failed to keep. Additionally, he has not obtained drug treatment or \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nas recently as October 2019, while holding a security clearance. I also considered the \ncircumstances he described surrounding his uses and his stated intent not to use drugs \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph     2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except as it \nrefers to SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nSubparagraphs     2.b-2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 16-20) Applicant was arrested in April 1992 and charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, both felonies. He testified he was in college and he and a group of friends decided to order a pizza and then steal the pizza from the delivery person and not pay. He was with the group when two people stole the pizza and beverages and they all ran away. Applicant ran and did not get caught but later turned himself in. He admitted it was a dumb college stunt. He participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to perform community service, pay a fine, and was on probation. He successfully completed the program and in 1996 the charge was dismissed. Applicant did not disclose these felony charges on his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA) as was required.

He was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol information \ncourse. This was the first time he attended an alcohol information course. (Tr. 48-52; GE \n11) \nIn August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and driving while \nlicense suspended or revoked. Applicant testified that he was drinking alcohol with friends \nat a bar. He and his friend left, and Applicant was following his friend in his car to another \nlocation. He was stopped by the police. He said he was unaware that his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended when he was stopped. He learned he had not completed the \nrequirements for reinstatement of his suspended license that was issued by another state. \nHe said he took care of the requirements. He spent a couple of days in jail. He was \nconvicted of DUI. He was ordered to take two alcohol courses that required weekly \nattendance. He testified he did not have a problem with alcohol, but rather he had a \nproblem with driving after he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 52-56 73-74; GE 2, 14) \nIn November 2019, Applicant was charged with simple assault-family violence. He \nwas ordered to attend a 24-week anger management course.

The police arrived and he was arrested. \nHe admitted he had consumed a couple of beers at the time. His wife contacted the \nprosecutor saying she regretted her actions. Applicant\u2019s case was nolle prosequi under a \npretrial diversion program after he completed an anger management course.

(Tr. 21, \n84-85) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant was arrested in 1992 and charged with robbery and conspiracy to \ncommit robbery, both felonies. In 1993, he was charged with simple assault. In 1994, he \nwas charged with obstructing highway/other public passages. In 1996, he was charged \nwith alcohol in public. In 2007, he was charged with possession of marijuana and public \nconsumption of alcohol. In 2012 and 2013, he was charged with driving after license \nsuspended/revoked. In 2014 and 2017, he was charged with DUI. In 2019, he was \ncharged with simple assault. In 2021, he was charged with DUI. He has been convicted \nthree times of DUI. He is on probation until October 2024 for his most recent DUI. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has a long history of violating the law. Some of his earlier offenses, \nincluding the felony charges, could be attributed to being young, immature, and the \nenvironment he grew up in. He was given a chance through the pretrial diversion of the \nfelony offenses to move forward in the right direction. Applicant continued to be arrested \nfor driving on a suspended or revoked license, public drinking, possession of marijuana, \nsimple assault, and three times for DUI. I have considered that some of the charges were \ndismissed or not prosecuted. Applicant is on probation for his most recent DUI conviction \nuntil 2024. Based on his extensive criminal conduct, I am unable to conclude future \nmisconduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct spans more than 30 \nyears. There is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. The above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline G. \nIn 1996, Applicant was arrested for alcohol use in public. In 2007, he was charged with \npublic consumption of alcohol. He has been convicted three times for DUI, the latest in \n2021. The evidence supports the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has repeatedly been involved in alcohol-related incidents from 1996 to \n2021. He has repeatedly been required to take alcohol awareness classes. He told the \ngovernment investigator in 2019 that there was a zero chance he would be involved in \nanother alcohol-related incident. He is currently abstaining from alcohol consumption as \npart of his probation from his 2021 DUI conviction. Applicant has not participated in \ntreatment. He indicated his problem is that he drives after drinking, not his drinking. \nApplicant is still completing the terms of his probation regarding his last DUI. Insufficient \ntime has passed to believe future alcohol-related conduct is unlikely to recur. There is \ninsufficient evidence that he has acknowledged his problem with alcohol, and has taken \naction to overcome it. He is not participating in alcohol counseling or treatment. None of \nthe mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal drug possession arrests were cross-alleged under Guideline \nH. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June 1990 to June 2022. \nHe was charged in May 2007 with possession of marijuana, 5 grams of hashish. The \ncharges were dropped due to an administrative problem by the prosecution. In 2014, he \nwas stopped by police and was charged with DUI. When his vehicle was searched a bag \nof marijuana was confiscated. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after he applied for a security clearance. He \nhas used edible marijuana while on probation. Applicant is attempting to stop associating \nwith friends who use drugs. He continues to associate with friends who use drugs but is \nattempting to stop. The recency and frequency of his drug use, and his failure to cease \nusing drugs even after applying for a security clearance raise concerns. I cannot find that \nfuture illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. He has not established a pattern of abstinence \nor signed a statement to abstain from future drug involvement. The above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant disclosed his 2014 and 2017 DUI convictions on his SCA but failed to \ndisclose any of his other criminal arrests, charges, or convictions as required. When he \nwas interviewed by a government investigator in 2019 and 2020, he again failed to \ndisclose his past criminal arrests, charges, or convictions. Although he may not have been \nable to recall some of the older minor offenses, he had no explanation for why he did not \ndisclose anything except his DUI offenses on his SCA. Applicant may have forgotten \nsome of his minor criminal arrests, but I do not believe he did not recall any of his criminal \narrests or charges, especially regarding the questions that specifically ask if he had been \narrested and charged with a felony or any arrests related to alcohol and drugs. He was \ngiven an opportunity during his interview with a government investigator to provide this \ninformation and again did not. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his criminal arrests \non his SCA and when interviewed by the government investigator in 2019 and in 2020. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose any of his criminal conduct except his \nDUIs is not minor. He was offered an opportunity by the government investigator during \nhis background interview to provide information about these matters and failed to do so. \nThe security clearance process relies on those seeking a clearance to be honest and \nforthcoming. Applicant was not. which casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, G, H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Motion to Amend the SOR In FORM 2, pursuant to \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.13 and E3.1.17 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved to amend two SOR allegations. He moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.e, based on Applicant\u2019s Answer, so that it now reads as follows: 1.e: You provide approximately $500 per month to your mother-in-law, who is a citizen and resident of Tunisia, to pay your wife\u2019s expenses so that the Tunisian government does not take legal action against her or her parents. Department Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 2.a, based on his Answer and on earlier record evidence, to read as follows: 2.a: You are indebted to [an auto financing creditor] on an account that has been charged off in the approximate amount of $29,100. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, the account remains delinquent. Based on their support in the record evidence and since Applicant had an opportunity to answer both amended allegations, the amendments to the SOR are GRANTED. However, I read Applicant\u2019s statements in FORM Response 2 as including denials to both allegations. Findings of Fact In his Answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline B allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d and denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, all with explanations. He denied all of the Guideline F allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.n, all with explanations. I construe his statements in FORM Response 2, to include denials of the amended allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.

(FORM Response 1) The supporting documents \nsubmitted by each party are discussed below. \nOn September 23, 2022, DOHA Administrative Judge Noreen Lynch issued a \ndecision in which she denied Applicant eligibility for a position of public trust. Applicant \nappealed, and on December 6, 2022, the DOHA Appeal Board issued a decision \nremanding the case to a different DOHA administrative judge for reprocessing. (ADP \nCase No. 20-02075, (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2022)) (Appeal Board Decision) \nThe final paragraph of the Appeal Board\u2019s decision included the following \ninstructions: \nApplicant should be provided the opportunity to request a hearing. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is required to issue a \nnew clearance decision. (Appeal Board Decision at 7) \nOn January 6, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On January 11, 2023, I held a \nconference call with the parties, which I summarized in an e-mail. During the call, as \nrequired by the Appeal Board, I gave Applicant the opportunity to elect a hearing, and \nhe did so (confirming it later by e-mail). Applicant, who at the time lived in California, \nalso advised that he was soon to take a new job in the Persian Gulf region. A hearing \ndate of February 22, 2023, was tentatively arranged, pending confirmation of specifics \nafter he moved. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) \nOn January 31, 2023, having arrived in the Persian Gulf, Applicant advised that \nhe longer worked for an employer requiring him to have either a security clearance or a \ntrustworthiness determination. He therefore sought to withdraw his request for a \ndetermination of his eligibility, since the unfavorable determination (by Judge Lynch) \nhad been vacated. In response, Department Counsel asserted that DOHA retained \njurisdiction, relying on \u00b6\u00b6 4.4 and 4.4.2 of the Directive, since a clearance decision had \nbeen issued. (E-mail correspondence, HE II) \nAfter considering the matter, I issued an Order on February 6, 2023, confirming \nthat DOHA retained jurisdiction, due to the issuance of the Appeal Board\u2019s clearance \ndecision, which vacated Judge Lynch\u2019s decision, and the Appeal Board\u2019s instruction \nquoted above. I also vacated the tentative February 22, 2023 hearing date, and gave \nApplicant another opportunity to clarify his choice of forum. (Feb. 6, 2023 Order, HE III) \nOn February 14, 2023, Applicant elected to revert to his choice of a decision on \nthe administrative (written) record, without a hearing. (HE IV). Department Counsel then \nsought and received permission to submit an updated FORM (with, at my request, an \nupdated Administrative Notice regarding Tunisia, and an updated credit report). (HE V) \nDepartment Counsel submitted the updated FORM on February 27, 2023. \n(FORM 2) Applicant received FORM 2 on March 9, 2023. Once he received it, I called \nhis attention to certain matters addressed in the FORM that he was directed to answer, \namong them an Amendment to the SOR, and a question as to the admissibility of the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsummary of his background interview.

(HE VI) \nApplicant responded on April 10, 2023, with a narrative statement (FORM \nResponse 2) and three additional documents that he submitted on April 10 and April 14, \n2023. He also raised some evidentiary matters that I addressed in an April 13, 2023 e-\nmail, discussed below. (HE VII) I closed the record on April 18, 2023. (HE VIII) \nAdditional Procedural Rulings \nThe Government\u2019s original FORM included documents marked as Items 1 \nthrough 6. Items 1 and 2 are the original SOR and Applicant\u2019s original Answer. They are \nthe pleadings in the case and are not evidentiary exhibits. Item 3 is his e-QIP \napplication for a position of public trust. Items 4 and 5 are Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports (CBRs) dated December 2021 and January 2020, respectively. Item 6 is the \nsummary of his February 24, 2020 background interview. The Government\u2019s updated \nFORM included a February 27, 2023 CBR, which I have marked as Item 7. \nApplicant\u2019s original FORM Response included three documents: Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A is a \u201cProperty Order Attachment to Judgment\u201d relating to his divorce. AE \nB and AE C are Applicant\u2019s paystubs from his employer from April 8, 2022 and March 7, \n2021, respectively. \nWith his updated FORM Response, Applicant provided three additional \ndocuments. AE D is a May 2021 letter to Applicant from the IRS regarding allocation of \na portion of a federal tax refund to satisfy another federal debt. AE E is an e-mail from \nApplicant explaining AE F and AE G, which are screenshots regarding his 2022 state \nand federal tax refunds. \nIn FORM Response 2, Applicant objected to admission of Item 6, under \u00b6 \nE.3.1.20 of the Directive. Item 6 is therefore not admitted, and I will not consider it in \nmaking my decision. He objected to Items 4 and 5 on the grounds that the CBRs are \noutdated. That objection is overruled, and Items 4 and 5 are admitted, as set forth in HE \nVII. Items 3 and 7 are admitted without objection. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A \nthrough AE G), along with his two FORM responses, are admitted without objection. \n(Applicant also objected to \u201cadmission of the updated FORM,\u201d but that is an argument \nby Department Counsel and not part of the record evidence). \nRequests for Administrative Notice \nWith both FORMs, Department Counsel submitted written requests that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Tunisia. (Administrative Notice (AN) I and AN \nII). Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts contained in the \nrequests that are supported by source documents from official U.S. Government \npublications.

He moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.e, based \non Applicant\u2019s Answer, so that it now reads as follows: \n1.e: \nYou provide approximately $500 per month to your mother-in-law, \nwho is a citizen and resident of Tunisia, to pay your wife\u2019s \nexpenses so that the Tunisian government does not take legal \naction against her or her parents. \nDepartment Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 2.a, based on his Answer and on earlier \nrecord evidence, to read as follows: \n2.a: \nYou are indebted to [an auto financing creditor] on an account that \nhas been charged off in the approximate amount of $29,100. As of \nthe date of this Statement of Reasons, the account remains \ndelinquent. \nBased on their support in the record evidence and since Applicant had an \nopportunity to answer both amended allegations, the amendments to the SOR are \nGRANTED. However, I read Applicant\u2019s statements in FORM Response 2 as including \ndenials to both allegations. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline B allegations \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d and denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, all with explanations. He denied all of the \nGuideline F allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.n, all with explanations. I construe his \nstatements in FORM Response 2, to include denials of the amended allegations at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He married his first wife in 2002. They separated in \n2014 and divorced in September 2019. (AE A) He has a son and a daughter, both \nteenagers, with his first wife. (Item 3) He states several times that he and his first wife \nhad a difficult relationship. He asserts that she was addicted to drugs, that he had a \nrestraining order against her, and that she impacted his finances negatively during their \nseparation. Applicant remarried in October 2019. His two children live with him and his \nsecond wife. He currently works at an overseas location.

(FORM Responses 1 and 2) \nBetween 1997 and 2014, he served in the Marine Corps on active duty, and in reserve \nstatus in the Air National Guard. He retired from the Marine Corps in 2014 and was \ndischarged honorably. (Item 3) After leaving the military in September 2014, Applicant \nworked for several years in a variety of jobs in the defense industry, both in the United \nStates and overseas. (Item 3; FORM Response 1) He resigned from his job with a \ndefense contractor at a naval air station in the western United States in February 2023. \n(FORM Response). \nAs noted in the procedural history of this case, above, Applicant has now \nrelocated to the Persian Gulf, where he has taken a job outside the defense industry, a \njob for which he needs neither access to classified nor sensitive information. Since this \ncase was remanded by the Appeal Board for a new decision, however, DOHA retains \njurisdiction over the case even if Applicant is no longer sponsored for classified or \nsensitive access, as also discussed above. \nFew details about Applicant\u2019s current employment situation are known. He does \nnot identify his employer, except to say that \u201cI work overseas representing US interests.\u201d \n(FORM Response 2). He provided no details of his income or salary, or other terms of \nhis new employment. \nGuideline B \nThe foreign influence allegations under Guideline B concern Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Tunisia through his wife and her family. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Tunisian citizen. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) At the time he submitted his e-\nQIP (October 2019) she was applying for a U.S. immigrant visa. (Item 3 at 30) More \nrecently, Applicant indicates in FORM Response 2 that she is a legal permanent \nresident of the United States, and she now qualifies for expedited citizenship through \nhis status as a spouse regularly employed abroad. She has relocated to the United \nStates, and he says she will join him in his overseas location once she obtains U.S. \ncitizenship in an estimated 6-12 months. (FORM Response 2) He noted in FORM \nResponse 1 that his wife operated a physical therapy clinic in Tunisia until 2016. \nApplicant asserts that his wife\u2019s loyalty to Tunisia extends only to food and \nsports. She loves America and the American way of life and embodies the sacred \nnational values of \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of freedom.\u201d She is willing to renounce her \nTunisian citizenship once she obtains U.S. citizenship. Applicant himself has no \nallegiance or loyalty to Tunisia except for his wife\u2019s family, who are \u201cwould-be \nAmericans\u201d born with the wrong passports. He asserts, essentially, that Tunisia is not a \nsecurity concern because it is a small country that does not often make world news and \nwill never be able to recover economically from its historical status as a French colony. \nHe notes that the murder rate in Tunisia is less than in the U.S., and much less than in \nMexico (where he says, \u201cno one is denied a clearance for having close ties.\u201d) (FORM \nResponses 1 and 2; Answer) (This last statement is not necessarily true, but since the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s eligibility here is not a comparative exercise, it is also not \nsomething that needs to be addressed further.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Tunisia. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) He disclosed them both on his e-QIP and noted that he and his mother-in-\nlaw do not speak the same language, so communication was through his wife. (Item 3 \nat 37) He and his mother-in-law later had a falling out, and he says they no longer \ncommunicate. (Answer) He said his father-in-law is a \u201cdecent guy,\u201d but they do not \nunderstand each other, so communication is difficult. (Answer) He provides no \nindication in the FORM Responses about any more recent interactions.  \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of Tunisia. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He says \nin his Answer that they met twice on vacations to Tunisia a number of years ago, and \nthat \u201c[I] don\u2019t much care for her.\u201d (Answer) He provides no indication in the FORM \nResponses about more recent interactions. \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a Tunisian citizen, allegedly living in Kuwait. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) On his e-QIP, Applicant reported that his brother-in-law lived there and worked for a \ncommercial airliner. He said they were friends. (Item 3 at 39-40) In his Answer, \nApplicant said his brother-in-law had relocated to the United States. Applicant let his \nbrother-in-law live with him (and his wife) but asked him to move out for being a \n\u201cfreeloader.\u201d The brother-in-law chose to remain in the United States rather than return \nto Tunisia, where he says job opportunities are few. Applicant does little more than \nexchange \u201cpleasantries\u201d with him. (Answer) He provides no indication in the FORM \nResponses about more recent interactions.  \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.e, the Government alleges that Applicant sends $500 a month to \nsupport his mother-in-law in Tunisia. As amended, SOR \u00b6 1.e now includes the \nallegation that this money is \u201cto pay your wife\u2019s expenses so that the Tunisian \ngovernment does not take legal action against her or her parents.\u201d This is based on \nApplicant\u2019s Answer, in which he explained that the money concerns a car loan that his \nwife took out in Tunisia before they met, as well as \u201cback taxes\u201d on her failed physical \ntherapy business that she closed in 2016. (Answer) He explained further that he made \nthe payments on his wife\u2019s behalf essentially to avoid legal trouble that might result if \nthey did not pay the debt. He asserted in FORM Response 1 that he would no longer \nsend money to Tunisia since it suggested a security concern. (FORM Response 1) \nApplicant reaffirmed in FORM Response to that his wife no longer has debt in Tunisia \nand that he no longer sends money there. (FORM Response 2) \nApplicant gives no indication in FORM Response 2 of any recent travel to Tunisia \nby either himself or his wife. He asserts that if he were the subject of coercion or threats \nby his Tunisian family (or, one presumes, someone else), he would \u201cbreak contact and \nalert authorities.\u201d He took the job overseas to provide for his family. He loves his country \nand is proud of his Marine Corps service. He loves God, his mother and family, and \nAmerican values, and would never betray the country.

Applicant \ndenied all of the debts in the original SOR, with brief explanations. (Items 1, 2) He \nprovided some documents with his two FORM Responses, to be addressed below. \nThe existence of the SOR debts is established by the credit reports in the record, \nfrom January 2020 (Item 5) and December 2021. (Item 4) The Government included a \ncurrent credit report, from February 2023, with FORM 2. (Item 7) The specific SOR \ndebts are addressed below. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a debt that has been charged off by auto financing creditor C. The \nGovernment amended the amount owed from $46,000 to $29,100. (FORM Response 2) \nThe account is listed as charged off (for $29,186) in October 2014 on the January 2020 \ncredit report. (Item 5 at 8) Applicant denied the debt, asserting that it was the \nresponsibility of his former wife through their divorce settlement. (Item 2) \nOn his 2019, e-QIP, Applicant disclosed two repossessed autos, both financed \nby creditor C. One was his car, a 2014 leased German auto. It was repossessed after \nthe separation because he could not afford to support two households. Another was his \nex-wife\u2019s 2014 sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was in his name but which was assigned \nto her in the divorce. (Item 3 at 64-65) \nAE A is a \u201cProperty Order Attachment to Judgment\u201d relating to Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce. It notes that he and his first wife married in May 2002 and separated in \nFebruary 2014. AE A references a sport utility vehicle (SUV), the debt for which is fully \nassigned to the respondent (his ex-wife). The \u201cJudgment\u201d to which AE A refers as an \n\u201cAttachment\u201d is likely the Judgment of Divorce (from 2019), but it is not included in the \nrecord here. No other related documents are included. It is not entirely clear that this is \nthe same debt referenced in the SOR, but it is likely so, since Applicant\u2019s other 2014 car \nwas a leased vehicle. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b ($1,961) is a debt owed to an unidentified medical creditor, a debt \nlisted as past due as of January 2020. The date of last activity is June 2014, and it was \nassigned to collections in August 2015. (Item 5) Applicant denied the debt, asserting \nthat no member of his family had incurred a $1,900 medical debt. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g ($322) and 2.j ($160) are medical accounts placed for collection. \n(Item 5) The (same) collection agency is identified, but in each case the medical creditor \nis not. Applicant asserted that his ex-wife had incurred the debts in his name, without \nhis knowledge or approval after they divorced, in violation of an order relating to the \ndivorce settlement. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c ($1,635) is an account placed for collection by a military retailer or \ncreditor.

(Item 7) \nSOR \u00b6 2.l ($7,000) concerns delinquent federal income taxes for tax years (TY) \n2017 and 2018. Applicant denied owing any past-due federal taxes for TY 2018.

He \nasserted that he was having issues with his ex-wife (they were still married in TY 2017) \nbecause she \u201cwas refusing to let me claim both of my kids\u201d as dependents. He said he \nworked in a tax-free zone at the time and did not expect to have to pay taxes. He filed \nhis taxes and began a payment plan of about $1,000 a month for eight months to \nresolve the debt. He also said he had gained full custody of his children.

The \ndebt owed is unclear, but $2,014 (of Applicant\u2019s tax payment, or refund) was applied to \nit, as a \u201cNon-Tax Federal Debt.\u201d (AE D) (This \u201cNon-Tax Federal Debt\u201d is not discussed \nelsewhere in the record, and it is not alleged in the SOR.). Further, AE D does not \nindicate that any portion of the $4,360 payment was redirected to pay any other federal \ndebt, such as past-due taxes from a prior tax year (such as 2017 or 2018, as alleged). \nApplicant also attached to FORM Response 2 a screen shot to show a $3,065 \nrefund on his 2022 federal taxes. (AE E) A subsequent deposit into his bank account is \nnot reflected. \nSOR \u00b6 2.m ($5,500) concerns delinquent state income taxes for the same years. \nApplicant denied owing state income taxes to his home state, both in his Answer and in \nFORM Response 1. He says he was mistaken about owing state income taxes. The \nsupport for the $5,500 figure alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.m is not clearly established. Applicant \ndisclosed owing state and federal taxes on his e-QIP of a combined total of about \n$7,000 or $8,000. (Item 3) He now asserts that he does not owe anything to the state. \nWhile it is possible that he owes state taxes for 2017 (since his federal return is unfiled) \nthis is not clearly established. \nFurther, with FORM Response 2, Applicant provided a screenshot from his \nphone reflecting that a 2022 state tax refund of $1,435, had been deposited into his \nbank account. From this, it can be inferred that he does not owe (or no longer owes) \nany past-due state tax debt, since if he did, the refund would have been captured to \naddress it. (AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 2.n alleges that Applicant\u2019s wages at his employer, company A, at the \nnaval air station \u201cwere garnished in about November 2019, in the approximate amount \nof $600, bi-weekly. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, the garnishment has \nnot been completed.\u201d (Item 1) The creditor related to the garnishment is not identified in \nthe record. In his Answer, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 2.n, noting that \u201cI neither work for \n[company A] nor have any wages garnished.\u201d (Item 2) AE B and AE C are Applicant\u2019s \npaystubs from a subsequent employer, Company P, from April 8, 2022 and March 2021, \nrespectively. No garnishment is indicated. This allegation is not established in the \nrecord evidence before me, and even if so, the garnishment is resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report in the record is from late February 2023. \n(Item 7) It shows one credit account that has been charged off in the amount of $1,168. \nThe account was opened in May 2021, last payment in September 2021, and reported \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin February 2023.

(Item \n7) \nIn FORM Response 2, Applicant addresses the question, \u201cCan you explain your \ndebt and unpaid taxes?\u201d He was employed from 2019 to 2022, but also attending \nschool. Some months he earned about $8,000, others about $5,000, with impacts of \nschool, illness, injury, and quarantining for COVID (three times, for two weeks each \ntime. His injuries resulted from his Marine Corps service or his later job as a mechanic \nat the naval air station. (FORM Response 2) \nApplicant acknowledged that he \u201cracked up debt on multiple credit cards.\u201d He \nwas making only minimum payments on one account. He could not afford to pay the \nothers (about $1,600). He hoped to build his credit but got behind and could not afford \nto pay them. He used one card (about $5,000) for utilities and living expenses and could \nnot afford to pay the minimum balance. He ran out of GI Bill money. His income was \nalso cut in half, making it difficult to feed and shelter his family. (FORM Response 2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved now that he has begun his job overseas. He \nsays he earns about $5,000 every two weeks (about $10,000 per month). His rent for \nthe home where his wife and children live in the U.S. is $1,925 per month. He has $640 \na month in car payments. He is beginning to get caught up on addressing his debt. He \nstill is settling his federal tax debt with the IRS, and he does not intend to contest what \nhe is told he owes. (FORM Response) \nTunisia is a constitutional republic with a multiparty, unicameral parliamentary \nsystem and a democratically elected president. Tunisia held its first democratic \nelections in 2014, and in October 2019, the country held parliamentary and presidential \nelections resulting in the first democratic transition of power. Kais Saied, an \nindependent candidate without a political party, was elected president. \nThe Government\u2019s Administrative Notice materials from the State Department \ndetail several terrorist attacks in 2020. The risk of terrorist activity remained high, \nexacerbated by sustained instability in Libya. Counterterrorism and border security \ncontinued to be top priorities of the Government of Tunisia in 2021. Tunisia works to \nprofessionalize its security apparatus in partnership with the United States. The State \nDepartment\u2019s 2021 Country Reports on Terrorism for Tunisia, available at \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/tunisia, \ncontains \nsubstantially similar information, while noting a decline in terrorist activity. \nSignificant human rights issues reported in 2021 included: reports of unlawful or \narbitrary killings by security forces; allegations of torture by government agents; \narbitrary arrests and detentions of suspects under antiterrorism or emergency laws; \nundue restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including criminalization of \nlibel; widespread corruption, although the government took steps to combat it; societal \nviolence and threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and \nintersex persons; criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct that resulted \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin arrests and abuse by security forces; and the worst forms of child labor. The State \nDepartment\u2019s \n2022 \nHuman \nRights \nReport \nfor \nTunisia, \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/tunisia, \ndetailed substantially similar information. \nIn October 2022, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 2 travel advisory \nfor Tunisia, advising U.S. nationals exercise increased caution when travelling to \nTunisia due to terrorism. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, \nto a determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \n[trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology;  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and   \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or if the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nA heightened security risk is established by the administratively noticed facts \nabout Tunisia in the record, due to human rights issues and the risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s wife (SOR \u00b6 1.a) remains a Tunisian citizen, though she now lives in \nthe United States, and she intends to continue pursuing U.S, citizenship. She lives with \nher husband and his children (even though he has taken a job overseas, he remains \nfinancially responsible for the household). AG \u00b6 7(e) applies to her. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Tunisia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c) His brother-in-law now lives in the United States \n(and not in Kuwait) but remains a Tunisian citizen. (SOR \u00b6 2.d) His brother-in-law\u2019s U.S. \nimmigration status is unclear, but he no longer lives under Applicant\u2019s roof. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) apply to them, as well as to Applicant\u2019s wife. \nAG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. Applicant reaffirmed in FORM Response 2 that his \nwife no longer has debt in Tunisia and that he no longer sends money there. SOR \u00b6 2.e \nis found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife remains a Tunisian citizen, but she now lives with Applicant in \nthe U.S. Her parents remain in Tunisia, as does her sister, but Applicant has little \ninteraction with them, and a limited relationship. He took in her brother to help him out, \nbut the brother overstayed his welcome and now lives elsewhere (still in the U.S). \nApplicant seems to have little current contact with him. There is no indication that \nApplicant or his wife have recently returned to Tunisia. \nThere is some evidence of a heightened risk trustworthiness concern with \nTunisia, given terrorism and human rights issues, but that concern is rather generalized. \nIt is also lessened here by Applicant\u2019s limited contacts with Tunisia, despite family \nrelationships there. Even so, he is not close to them. His wife presumably is closed to \nher family, which is understandable. \nApplicant is a retired Marine and longtime U.S. Government contractor. His life is \nhere and his assertions of his love for his country and family are doubtlessly genuine. It \nis unlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between his \nfamily and the interests of the United States. I have no concerns that he would put the \ncountry at risk if family pressures were brought upon him. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) \napply, and foreign influence trustworthiness concerns about his family connections with \nTunisia are mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity [trustworthiness] concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified (or sensitive) information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and \nsafeguarding classified (or sensitive) information.

He thereby put the burden \non the Government to establish them. The Government did that and met its burden for \nmost of the debts alleged, since most of them were either listed on the CBRs from 2020 \nor 2021.

The following mitigating conditions potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributes several of the debts to his first wife, who he says incurred \nexpenses during their several years of separation and attributed them to him. He denied \nall of the debts in the SOR on that and other grounds. \nApplicant asserts that two of the medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g, and 2.j) are his ex\u00ad\nwife\u2019s responsibility. The largest medical debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, for $1,961), which Applicant \ndenied, is not sufficiently identified to enable him to research it. \nApplicant said he paid debt SOR \u00b6 2.c in May 2021. This is not documented, but \nthe debt is also not listed on his most recent CBR. \nApplicant disputes many of the other SOR debts, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, 2.f. \nHe does not recognize others (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h and 2.k) or believes his ex-wife is \nresponsible (SOR \u00b6 2.i) There is no documentation to support his assertions, so AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not fully apply, because an applicant who disputes debts is expected to \ndocument the dispute and provide evidence of his efforts to resolve it. However, none of \nthe disputed debts are listed on a current credit report. \nThe auto debt at SOR \u00b6 2.a (now for $29,100) is documented as being assigned \nto Applicant\u2019s ex-wife in the divorce settlement. It is not Applicant\u2019s debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) \nfully applies to that debt, the largest in the SOR by far. \nApplicant no longer owes any past-due state income taxes. He received a refund \nfor 2022, and he documented that it was accepted and deposited into his account. SOR \n\u00b6 1.m is resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.l concerns $7,000 in past-due federal taxes for 2017 and \n2018. The figure comes from what Applicant self-reported on his e-QIP and is not \notherwise clearly documented. He says he is settling his federal tax debt with the IRS, \nand he does not intend to contest what he is told he owes. He provided documentation \nsuggesting that he no longer owes any past-due federal income tax debt from TY 2017 \nor 2018. (He also asserts that his 2017 federal tax return remains unfiled, due to an \nongoing dispute with his ex-wife, probably over claiming their children as dependents. \nThis is not alleged in the SOR, but it weighs against mitigation as an ongoing, \nunresolved tax issue). I nonetheless conclude that Applicant\u2019s tax issues are related to \nhis contentious divorce and that he is addressing them. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe debts and taxes in the SOR, all of which Applicant denies, are largely \nattributable to his period of separation and divorce, at the end of what appears to be a \ndifficult marriage. Applicant also acknowledges subsequent problems with his finances, \nin that he used credit cards to pay expenses. By his own admission, he is still digging \nout, and hopes to use his current job overseas to continue his path towards financial \nstability. Importantly, his current credit report shows few delinquencies. This tends to \nsupport his assertions that his financial issues are largely. in the past. I conclude that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) all apply. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or position of public trust by considering the \ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative \njudge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. Applicant has established that \nhe is a suitable candidate for access to sensitive information and a position of public \ntrust. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.n:  \nFor Applicant \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s access to \nsensitive information.

After confirming that he was \nstill ready to proceed with the hearing, I left the record open until January 27, 2023, for \nApplicant to review the document and lodge any objections. (Tr. 12-15) He did not. The \ndocument is admitted without objection as GE 4. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 42, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, as a project lead \nsince April 2018. He was initially granted access to classified information in 2012 and \nmaintained access until 2015.

He also sold products \nthrough a well-known national multi-level marketing company. He did not earn enough \nmoney to meet his financial obligations. (Tr. 22, 25-28, 32-38) \nWhen Applicant became unemployed, he began to take steps to further reduce \nhis expenses. Unable to maintain his apartment, he moved in with his father in October \n2016. Because he was not earning sufficient income to pay all his obligations, his \nstudent loans became delinquent in November 2015. He returned to full employment in \nApril 2017. He worked in a technician position until starting his current job in April 2018, \nwhich paid $64,000 annually. Since then, his financial situation has changed. He \ncontinues to live with his father, splitting household expenses, and providing his father \nsupport after he was diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder in early 2022. He no \nlonger pays child support for his two children. His older child, now an adult, is living on \nhis own with his wife and child. Applicant was awarded full custody of his younger child \nafter the child\u2019s mother died. The child receives approximately $600 social security \ndeath benefits each month. (Tr, 23, 25, 29-31, 38-40, 46, 48-52) \nIn August 2021, Applicant paid off the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($3,501); 1.i \n($576); and 1.j ($75). Between November 2015 and March 2020, he did not make any \npayments on his student loans. He testified that he tried to rehabilitate his student loans \nin the past but could not recall the details of his efforts. He consolidated his loans (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e, 1.g \u2013 1.h) into two accounts in September 2021.The loans are currently in \nadministrative forbearance under the Covid-19 student loan payment pause issued by \nPresident Biden in March 2020, which also covered delinquent and defaulted loans. \n(See, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/default) Under the terms \nof the pause, he is not required to take any corrective actions towards the loans or \nmake any payments. He entered a rehabilitation program in late 2021 and provided \nevidence that he made one payment of $253.23 in December 2021. He could not \nprovide information about the terms of the rehabilitation program or the repayment \nterms of the loan once the administrative forbearance is lifted. (Tr. 23-24, 39, 41-43, 53; \nAE A-E; Answer) \nApplicant considers his finances to be stable. He earns approximately $70,000 \nannually.

(Tr. 39, 43-44, 54-56) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.

The \nfollowing mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not the result of reckless or irresponsible \nbehavior, but instead were caused by events beyond his control \u2014 7 months of \nunemployment followed by 15 months of underemployment. During this period, he \nbecame unable to pay his financial obligations and incurred delinquent debt. He acted \nresponsibly considering these circumstances by reducing his living expenses. Upon \nreturning to full-time employment, he did not immediately begin to address his \ndelinquent debt. However, the record establishes that other life issues demanded his \nattention, such as his father\u2019s medial issues and the needs of his younger son after the \ndeath of his mother. \nThe record supports a finding that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to \nresolve his delinquent debt. He resolved three debts totaling $4,152 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.j) \nin August 2021. Despite having the benefit of the Covid-19 payment pause, he took \nsteps to address his student loans. He consolidated the seven loans into two, which he \nbelieves will make them easier to manage and pay going forward. Although he does \nnot know what his payments will be once the pause is lifted, the changes in finances \nover the last few years indicate that he has the means to make the payments. Since \nreturning to work, his living expenses have decreased, and he no longer has child \nsupport obligations. His minor child receives social security income, which supplements \nthe cost of his care. He has also managed to increase his short-term cash and \nretirement savings. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d).

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns.

Additionally, Applicant allegedly accumulated delinquent tax, consumer, and \nmedical debts that also remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the alleged failure-to-file \nallegations with explanations.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  . .  .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent federal taxes owed for tax years 2017 and 2019, in addition \nto accrued consumer and medical debts. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses and unresolved tax and other debt \ndelinquencies warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax as required,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses, require no independent proof to\nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted tax-filing failures with respect to tax years 2015 and 2016 \nare fully documented and create judgment issues as well over the management of his \nfinances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing lapses and \ndocumented delinquencies in tax and other consumer and medical accounts are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR \nCase No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \nWithout any evidence of IRS or state extensions of the times allotted for his filing \nhis tax returns, or good cause demonstrated for his untimely filing of tax returns for tax \nyears 2015-2016, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions are available to \nApplicant.

Jan. 20, 2020) \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s failure to credibly document his challenges to most of the \nreported tax (save for tax year 2018) and other debt delinquencies listed in the SOR, \npreclude his availing of any of the mitigating conditions potentially available to him. \nWithout credible challenges to the information reported in his credit reports about the \ndelinquent status of the tax, consumer, and medical debts covered in the SOR, \nfavorable inferences cannot be drawn as to Applicant\u2019s exoneration claims. Only owed \nfederal taxes for tax year 2018 is credibly resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. Federal taxes \nowed for tax years 2017 and 2019 remain unaddressed and outstanding. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of multiple tax-filing lapses (i.e., tax years 2015-\n2016) and accumulation of unresolved tax, consumer, and medical debts are fully \ncompatible with minimum standards for holding a security clearance. While Applicant is \nentitled to credit for his work in the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this \ntime to overcome his repeated failures or inability to address his tax-filing and debt \ndelinquencies responsibilities in a timely way over the course of several years. Overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nApplicant\u2019s past failures to file his federal and state income tax returns in a timely \nand responsible way and timely discharge any tax, consumer, and medical accounts \nreflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently stable manner to \nmeet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. Based on a \nconsideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it is too soon \nto make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, good-faith \nefforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the foreseeable future. \nMore time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of control of his finances to \nestablish his overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

The SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s best friend and his friend\u2019s wife (SOR 1.g), a sister-in-law (SOR 1.h), two childhood friends (SOR 1.i), and a niece (SOR 1.j) are all citizens and residents of Kosovo. Further, the SOR alleged that between October 2007 and November 2015, Applicant resided at a U.S. military installation in Kosovo as part of his employment with a U.S. defense contractor, and that he maintained regular contact with his wife and children and other family members who were living in Kosovo during that period (SOR 3 1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant, his wife and his children, have lived in Kosovo with his parents since November 2015 (SOR 1.e). Finally, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife maintains a bank account in Kosovo with a balance of about $12,000, which Applicant provided (SOR 1.k); and that Applicant owns three properties in Kosovo with an approximate total value of $180,000 (SOR 1.l). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not determine, as required \nby Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security for Applicant to have a security clearance. \nOn June 23, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR). The SOR alleged facts that raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case concerns \nsecurity concerns outlined under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 8, 2022. On May 17, 2022, I scheduled this case to be \nheard remotely using a video conferencing platform on June 29, 2022. The parties \nappeared as scheduled. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. GX 1 \u2013 3 were \nadmitted without objection. GX 4 presented the Government\u2019s request that I take \nadministrative notice of information about Kosovo, the country at issue in this case. I \ngranted that request and have considered herein the information provided in GX 4 as \nappropriate. Appellant appeared as scheduled and testified, but he did not present any \ndocumentary information. Also included in the record are the Government\u2019s Exhibit List, \nidentified as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1, and the Government\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated \nSeptember 13, 2021 (HX 2). (Tr. 16 \u2013 17) \nOn October 14, 2022, I issued an unfavorable decision denying Applicant\u2019s request \nfor clearance. As provided for by Sections E3.1.28 and E3.1.30, Applicant appealed my \ndecision. On December 21, 2022, the Appeal Board remanded this matter to me for \nfurther adjudication with the following instructions: \n. . . . . [W]e conclude that the best resolution of the issues before us is to \nremand the case to the Judge to identify the particular documents upon \nwhich he relied, provide them to Applicant and Department Counsel for \ninspection and for any objections they may have, and include them in the \nevidentiary record. After providing Applicant and Department Counsel an \nopportunity to address the documents in question and present additional \nevidence if desired, the Judge will issue a new decision. We do not retain \njurisdiction over remanded cases. After the Judge issues a new decision, \nthe appropriate party can appeal pursuant to Directive \u204b\u204b E3.1.28-35. Other \nissues in Applicant\u2019s brief are not ripe for consideration. ISCR Case No. 20-\n02266 at 3. (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2022) \nOn January 20, 2023, I issued a Remand Order, which is included in the record as \nHX 3, whereby I reopened the record, and provided Applicant and the Government with \nenclosed copies of the documents on which I relied. The documents were identified in my \norder as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEnclosure 1: U.S. State Department Travel Advisory for Kosovo, dated \nOctober 4, 2020 (3 pages).

This \ndocument is available online at: \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-\npractices/kosovo/. \nApplicant was given until February 10, 2023, to review and respond to the enclosed \ndocuments, and to provide additional evidence, if desired. The Government was directed \nto respond no later than March 3, 2023, to Applicant\u2019s additional information and, if \ndesired, provided additional information. Both parties confirmed receipt of my order on \nJanuary 20, 2023. On February 13, 2023, having received no response from Applicant, I \ncontacted him via email to again confirm his receipt of my order and to ascertain whether \nhe intended to submit additional information. He replied, in relevant part, as follows: \nI do not have any additional [sic] to submit. As I said, it is very disappointing \nthat while I was in service, I was considered worthy of a clearance and now \nthat I am just a veteran not worthy! Even though there has never been nor \nwill there be any derogatory information about me. I want to thank everyone \nfor their time which I did not mean to waste. If I get cleared great, and if not, \nI guess life goes on. Regardless, my loyalty to the United States was, is, \nand will remain intact. \nOn February 15, 2023, Department Counsel notified me that the Government had \nnothing to submit in response to the Remand Order. Accordingly, the record closed on \nFebruary 15, 2023. Copies of all email communications pertaining to my actions in \nresponse to the Appeal Board\u2019s remand order in this case are included as HX 4. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife (SOR 1.a), children (SOR 1.b), parents \n(SOR 1.c), and siblings (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Kosovo. The SOR also \nalleged that Applicant\u2019s best friend and his friend\u2019s wife (SOR 1.g), a sister-in-law (SOR \n1.h), two childhood friends (SOR 1.i), and a niece (SOR 1.j) are all citizens and residents \nof Kosovo. \nFurther, the SOR alleged that between October 2007 and November 2015, \nApplicant resided at a U.S. military installation in Kosovo as part of his employment with \na U.S. defense contractor, and that he maintained regular contact with his wife and \nchildren and other family members who were living in Kosovo during that period (SOR \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant, his wife and his children, have lived in \nKosovo with his parents since November 2015 (SOR 1.e). \nFinally, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife maintains a bank account in Kosovo \nwith a balance of about $12,000, which Applicant provided (SOR 1.k); and that Applicant \nowns three properties in Kosovo with an approximate total value of $180,000 (SOR 1.l). \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. When he was born, Serbia, formerly a part of the now-\ndissolved Yugoslavia, controlled the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, where he and his \nfamily and friends all lived. When Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Applicant \nbecame a citizen of the newly-formed nation of Kosovo; however, he was always a citizen \nof Kosovo as it existed before the Kosovo War of 1998 \u2013 1999 and subsequent \nindependence from Serbia. He was raised and educated in Kosovo through his high \nschool graduation in 1999. Between June and December 2002, he worked as a linguist \nfor a U.S. defense contractor in support of U.S. forces operating as part of a NATO \ncoalition put in place after the Kosovo War ended in 1999. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 27 \u2013 28) \nIn December 2002, at age 21, Applicant traveled to the United States on a tourist \nvisa. During that visit, he met a woman who was a U.S. citizen and they decided to get \nmarried. They arranged to be married in June 2003 before his tourist visa expired and he \nwould be forced to return to Kosovo, and either obtain a new tourist visa or apply for entry \nto the United States for different reasons. After his marriage, he obtained permanent \nresident status in the United States by virtue of his marriage to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1; GX \n2; GX 3; Tr. 28 \u2013 29) \nApplicant joined the U.S. Army on January 13, 2004. The following day, he and his \nAmerican wife finalized their divorce. Applicant claims she did not want to move to his \nduty station in another state or to be married to someone who would have to move a lot \nfor military assignments. He served as an airborne infantryman and deployed on multiple \ncombat missions in the Middle East. By serving on active duty in the U.S. military, \nApplicant was able to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, which he did in October 2004. \nHe received a security clearance in March 2007, and he was honorably discharged in \nSeptember 2007. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 11 \u2013 12, 29 \u2013 32) \nTwo months after his discharge, Applicant returned to Kosovo. In 2007, he found \nemployment there for the next eight years as a linguist with two U.S. defense contractors \nsupporting the ongoing U.S. military mission. He later was promoted to a management \nposition involving physical security requirements for the U.S. military installation in \nKosovo that was his job site. He worked in that capacity in Kosovo until 2015, when the \ncontract ended. During his employment, Applicant had access to classified information \nbased on the security clearance he held in the Army.

(GX 1; GX 2; GX 3) \nApplicant remarried in April 2006 and has two children. His current wife is a citizen \nresident of Kosovo. She has since been granted permanent resident status in the United \nStates. Except for visits to Applicant\u2019s duty station in the United States, she has stayed in \nKosovo since 2006, including while Applicant completed the last of his combat \ndeployments to the Middle East before his discharge in 2007. His two children, now ages \n8 and 13, were born in Kosovo after Applicant was discharged from the Army. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 33 \u2013 35) \nBecause Applicant\u2019s children were born abroad to a U.S. citizen, they were eligible \nfor U.S. citizenship at birth, their status being derived from Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship. \nHowever, Applicant testified they could not immediately receive U.S. citizenship because \nhe had not been physically present in the United States for five years before they were \nborn. Thus, he was required first to establish their Kosovo citizenship (he obtained \nKosovo passports for them), then obtain immigrant visas for each child and apply for their \nnaturalization after the family returned to the United States, which they did in August 2020. \nThe children are now dual citizens of the United States and Kosovo. (GX 1; Tr. 38 \u2013 39; \nsee also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(g)) \nBetween 2007 and 2015, Applicant lived at the military facility in Kosovo that was \nhis job site. His family remained at their home in Kosovo and Applicant was able to see \nthem periodically during scheduled time off. This was required by the terms of his \nemployment because he was on call at all times. In January 2019, he was hired by \nanother U.S. defense contractor for work as a linguist at the same facility in Kosovo. His \nemployment is contingent on his renewed eligibility for a security clearance. He testified \nthat if he does not qualify for employment as a contractor in Kosovo, he will take his family \nback to the United States to find work. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 11 \u2013 12, 53 \u2013 54) \nAfter leaving his job in 2015, Applicant remained in Kosovo with his wife and \nchildren. He did not seek further work, choosing instead to be a stay-at-home father in \nKosovo between 2015 and 2020 while his wife completed her college studies in Kosovo. \nIn August 2020, after he had received the SOR and became uncertain about whether he \nwould be able work as a linguist in Kosovo, Applicant and his family moved back to the \nUnited States where they rented a place to live so his children could attend school in the \nU.S. for the 2021 \u2013 2022 school year. During the summers of 2021 and 2022, they \nreturned to Kosovo. He appeared for his hearing virtually from Kosovo. While he wants \nhis children to experience their heritage in Kosovo, he does not want them to attend the \npublic schools there. However, he cannot afford private Kosovo schools without the \nincome from his potential employment as a linguist there. Pending the outcome of this \nadjudication, he planned to return with his family to the United States so his children can \nattend school here. It is assumed that he has returned to the United States for the 2022 \n\u2013 2023 school year. Applicant will bring his family back to Kosovo if he gets his clearance, \nand he eventually wants to retire there.

During his background investigation and counterintelligence screening \nfor his linguist position, he estimated those properties were worth about $180,000 total. \nAt his hearing, he testified their value has likely increased significantly. When he is in \nKosovo, Applicant and his family live in an apartment he owns. He leases the other two \nproperties to a friend who uses one as a bar and restaurant business, and the other as \nstorage for that business. (GX 1 \u2013 GX 3; Tr. 44 \u2013 47) \nApplicant does most of his banking through U.S.-based financial institutions. \nDuring his previous employment as a linguist, he opened a bank account in Kosovo for \nhis wife to use while he resided at the U.S. military facility. At one point, he had deposited \nabout $12,000 USD in that account, but he now estimates there is about $3,500 \nremaining. In his other U.S. accounts, Applicant has about $50,000 in retirement savings \nand investment funds. He has been able to support his family through non-defense \nindustry jobs while in the United States, proceeds from the two properties he leases in \nKosovo, and a monthly disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nWhen they are in Kosovo, his wife works as a teacher. When they were last in the United \nStates, he worked as a delivery driver between November 2021 and May 2022. (GX 1 \u2013 \n3; Tr. 54 \u2013 58) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are both retired teachers. When he and his family are in \nKosovo, he visits or calls them almost every day. When he is in the United States, he \ncalls them several times weekly. The same is true for his contact with his brothers and \nsisters, a sister-in-law, and a niece who are resident citizens of Kosovo. Applicant also \nhas continuing contact with his best friend and his wife, and with two childhood friends \nwhen he is in Kosovo, but their interactions are less frequent when he and his wife and \nchildren are in the United States. None of Applicant\u2019s family members or his friends are \nemployed by the Kosovo government; nor do they have any other connection to the \ngovernment of Kosovo or any other foreign country. (GX 2; Tr. 40 \u2013 43) \nTo properly assess the security significance of foregoing within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Kosovo as \npresented in GX 4. Additionally, some of the information about Kosovo requires \nexamination of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing Balkans War and Kosovo \nConflict. To that end, I sua sponte have taken notice of information about that region and \ncurrent U.S. involvement there that is available on the U.S. Department of State website. \nSpecifically, I have relied on the following documents: U.S. State Department Travel \nAdvisory for Kosovo, dated October 4, 2020(3 pages) (HX 3, Enclosure 1), and Kosovo \n2021 Human Rights Report (41 pages) (HX 3, Enclosure 2).1 As indicated, supra, on \nremand I provided the parties copies of these documents and they had an opportunity to \nobject, provide comments, and submit additional information.

Since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999, \nthe United States has been actively involved in helping Kosovo establish an independent \njudiciary and to provide for its own security. The U.S. and NATO have maintained a \nmilitary presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) made up of troops from \n28 countries. KFOR is still required in Kosovo to help counter instability caused by the \ninflux from foreign fighters, such as ISIS, and large numbers of migrants displaced by the \ncivil war in Syria and ongoing violence in Iraq and Kurdistan. Additionally, the U.S. \nDepartment of State has issued travel advisories for travel in certain parts of Kosovo \nwhere ethnic tensions and civil unrest continue to flare up and act as catalysts for terrorist \nactivities. \nKosovo\u2019s political system is premised on open representation of its citizens and \nthe emphasis on individual liberties and the rule of law. Nonetheless, human rights \nviolations are not uncommon, mostly affecting under-represented ethnic minorities. The \nState Department\u2019s Kosovo 2021 Human Rights Executive Summary stated the following: \nSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of: serious \nrestrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of \nviolence against journalists; serious government corruption and impunity; \nand crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting ethnic \nminorities or other marginalized communities. The government took steps \nto identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed \nhuman rights abuses, but at times lacked consistency. Many in the \ngovernment, the opposition, civil society, and the media reported instances \nof senior officials engaging in corruption or acting with impunity. The \ngovernment sometimes suspended, removed offenders from office, or \ntransferred the accused, and the justice sector sometimes took steps to \nprosecute and punish those officials who committed abuses, offenses, and \ncrimes. Many corrupt officials, however, continued to occupy public sector \npositions. (HX 3, Enclosure 2) \nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that Kosovo strives to be a stable, \ndemocratically-governed country, with interests consistent with those of the European \nUnion and NATO. Nonetheless, persistent ethnic strife, terrorist activities, an uneven \nhuman rights record, and other conditions on which the State Department has based its \ntravel advisories for Kosovo, all support a finding that there is a heightened risk \nassociated with having personal and financial ties there. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence  \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe Government\u2019s information, as well as Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and \nhis statements during his PSI and during counterintelligence screening for his most recent \nemployment all support the SOR allegations. Additionally, I have reviewed the \nGovernment\u2019s information in support of its request for administrative notice of facts about \nKosovo, as well as the information in HX 3, Enclosures 1 and 2. From those documents, \nI conclude conditions in that country present a heightened risk that Applicant\u2019s relatives \nand associates in Kosovo may be vulnerable to pressure or coercion as a means of \ncompromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to protect sensitive U.S. information. \nThe following AG \u00b6 7 disqualifying conditions apply: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) applies based on Applicant\u2019s close and continuing contacts with his wife, \nparents and other family members, as well as long-time friends, all of whom are citizen \nresidents of Kosovo. AG \u00b6 7(f) applies based on his continued ownership of three \nproperties in Kosovo, the value of which, when compared to his stated income and \nsavings, constitutes the majority of his net worth. However, the allegations at SOR 1.d \nand 1.e merely plead evidence of security concerns already addressed through SOR 1.a \n\u2013 1.c, and 1.f \u2013 1.j. Therefore, SOR 1.d and 1.e appear to be redundant and are resolved \nfor Applicant. Further, the SOR 1.k allegation regarding Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s bank account \ndoes not present a noteworthy security concern, particularly since the balance in that \naccount has fallen to about a quarter of the amount alleged. SOR 1.k is resolved for \nApplicant. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nThe record does not support application of any of these mitigating conditions. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply because Applicant has frequent contact with his family and \nfriends in Kosovo, a country that poses \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d His relationships with those citizen \nresidents of Kosovo are presumed to be close and he did not present any information that \nwould rebut that presumption. Further, AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Applicant does \nnot benefit from any deep ties to, or relationships in, the United States that might \ncounterbalance his interests in Kosovo. Since leaving the U.S. Army in 2007, Applicant \nlived continuously in Kosovo for most of the next 13 years, returning to the United States \nin August 2020 only because he was unsure of his ability to gain employment with a \ndefense contractor that would allow him to remain in Kosovo. One effect of his choice to \nstay in Kosovo, even after his contractor employment ended in 2015, was that his \npresence in the United States was not legally sufficient to allow his children to derive U.S. \ncitizenship from him. He and his immediate family live in Kosovo at least three months \nout of each year, returning to rented housing in the United States only for the school year. \nHe testified that if he could afford better schools in Kosovo through defense contractor \nemployment, he would prefer to live in his native country. He also intends to retire there. \nI also am mindful of Applicant\u2019s military service. It is highly significant that he \nwillingly risked his life in service to the United States and its interests in the Middle East. \nOn this point, he is owed a measure of gratitude. Yet, his five years of service constitute \nhis only real presence in the United States. As soon as he was discharged, he returned \nto Kosovo, started a family, and bought three properties between 2014 and 2018. Aside \nfrom the 2020 \u2013 2021 and (presumably) the 2022 \u2013 2023 school years in the United \nStates, he has chosen to remain in Kosovo since 2007, regardless of his employment \nstatus. All of the foregoing sustains doubts about whether Applicant has any \u201cdeep and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States\u201d that might cause him \u201cto \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s property and financial interests in \nKosovo are significant. He estimates his property values have increased since the SOR \nwas issued. In addition to his monthly VA disability benefits, the rental income he receives \nhelps support his wife and children. As noted above, all of the available information \nprobative of his finances shows that his holdings in Kosovo make up the majority of his \nnet worth. On balance, the security concerns about foreign influence are not mitigated. \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). In the context of assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation, his circumstances must be examined with the protection of the national \ninterest in mind. Those circumstances have changed significantly since Applicant first \nreceived a security clearance in connection with his military service. The government is \nnot estopped from re-assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation, particularly in response to new facts and circumstances. This decision is a \nrecognition of the heightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s close ties of affection for \npersons in a country that still presents a heightened risk of manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion aimed at leveraging an individual\u2019s access to classified information. When \ncompared to Applicant\u2019s relatively minor presence in, or ties to, the United States, his \npersonal ties and interests in Kosovo sustain doubts about the suitability of granting him \naccess to classified information. Because protection of the interests of national security \nis the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

Also, I took administrative notice of Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s brief, marking and admitting it as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was \nreceived on June 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old married woman with one child, an infant. She is a senior \nprogram analyst for a defense contractor. Her duties include serving as a transportation \nliaison between the United States and another country. She has worked in this position \nfor three years.

Rather than go to a physician \nand get another diagnosis, however, she began taking pills left over from a bottle of \nmedicine that she had been prescribed before starting college. \nShortly after returning to school from winter break, Applicant was administered a \nrandom drug test and tested positive for amphetamines.

Instead, he \ntold her to tell the officer in charge of the disciplinary proceeding that she received the \nADHD medicine from a friend. (Tr. 28) Applicant took the advice of her superior officer, \nand she was subsequently punished with 60 days of room restriction with 30 days \nsuspended. (Tr. 50) \nUltimately, Applicant was diagnosed again with ADHD and prescribed the \nmedication. (Tr. 28, 47) This time, she obtained a waiver. She graduated from the military \nacademy in 2012. (Tr. 20) \nIn response to interrogatories propounded in 2020, Applicant was asked to \ndisclose any illegal drug use, including any prescription drug without a prescription. She \ndisclosed her Adderall use but stated that she was first prescribed it in 2009 when she \nwas 19, instead of earlier when she was in middle school, as was actually the case. (GE \n8 at 9) In 2021, she provided a letter from her current physician setting forth the amount \nof Adderall prescribed per day and the length of time that the current physician has been \nmonitoring her Adderall use. (GE 1 at 27) \nIn 2013, after graduating from college, Applicant deployed to a combat theater. \n(GE 11 at 1) While deployed, she served as the executive officer of a headquarters \ncompany of a support battalion. (Tr. 32) She served in this combat theater for \napproximately seven months. \nAfter Applicant completed her combat tour of duty, she was transferred to an \nassignment in the United States. On July 4, 2014, while on leave, she celebrated \nIndependence Day with her spouse, enjoying alcoholic drinks at several bars while \nstrolling through the downtown area and enjoying the fireworks.  A few days later, \nApplicant was administered a random drug test, and tested positive for nordazepam, \noxazepam, and temazepam. These drugs are derivatives of Valium. Subsequently, she \nwas charged under Article 112a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with \nwrongful use of a controlled substance. (GE 10 at 2) Applicant contended that she did not \nintentionally take these drugs, and that a man who brought her a drink during the 4th  of \nJuly festivities must have spiked it. (These drugs are commonly known on the street as \ndate rape drugs. (GE 1 at 41; 99-106; GE 8 at 2, 7)). Ultimately, she was found guilty and \nadministratively separated with a general discharge under honorable conditions. (GE 11 \nat 1) \nIn March 2015, after leaving the armed services, Applicant took a private-sector \njob as a manufacturing supervisor. (GE 13 at 2) Before starting work, she signed a \ndocument acknowledging that the company had a drug and alcohol-free workplace policy. \n(GE 13 at 1) In May 2016, Applicant failed a randomly administered drug test, testing \npositive for marijuana, leading to her termination later that month. (GE 13 at 10) Applicant \ndiscussed this episode on two successive security clearance applications completed \nrespectively in 2016 and 2021. On both applications, she explained that this was the first \ntime she had ever tried marijuana and that she did not realize it was still illegal. (GE 6 at \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n34; GE 7 at 36-37) During a personal subject interview in 2017, when asked why she \nused marijuana, Applicant stated that she did not know. (GE 8 at 2) At the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s explanation alternated between using marijuana to counteract the symptoms \nof post-traumatic stress syndrome after having tried a number of ineffective, prescribed \nmedicines, and using marijuana not knowing that it was illegal in the state where she used \nit. (Tr. 31-32) She has no intent of using marijuana again. (AE F) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job and her community. According to her \nsupervisor, she has received numerous awards, all of which are testaments to her \u201cwork \nethic, esprit de corps, courage, and honesty.\u201d (AE D at 9) According to one of Applicant\u2019s \ngovernment customers, she is \u201ca total joy\u201d to be around. (AE D at 4) Also, Applicant is \nhighly dedicated to volunteerism, serving in multiple local volunteer positions over the \nyears, including a local citizen\u2019s advisory board, a local historical society, and an \nenvironmental organization where she assists with developing public community gardens. \n(AE C at 2, dated June 6, 2023, at 2-3; AE D at 15) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) Subparagraph 1.a asserts, in essence, that Applicant intentionally failed \nto disclose her ADHD diagnosis before beginning class at the military academy in 2008 \nto circumvent its medical waiver process. Applicant admittedly falsified where she \nobtained the ADHD medication after failing a drug test in 2009, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.c. Also, in her 2020 response to DOHA interrogatories, she gave a \nresponse regarding when she began using Adderall that conflicted with other record \nevidence, as alleged in subparagraph 1.f. Consequently, the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 16, as set forth below, are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant\u2019s positive test for amphetamines while at the military academy and her \nsubsequent punishment occurred 14 years ago when she was a teenager. Moreover, \nthere was no intent to circumvent the waiver process; Applicant stopped taking her ADHD \nmedicine when beginning college in a sincere attempt to ascertain whether she could \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsucceed without it. Moreover, regardless of whether she should have obtained a waiver \nbefore starting the medicine without a new prescription, she ultimately obtained an \nupdated prescription, resumed the medication, and graduated. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that Applicant did not intentionally withhold her ADHD \ndiagnosis to the academy before entering, as alleged. Consequently, neither of the \ndisqualifying conditions apply to the allegation set forth in subparagraph 1.a. I resolve this \nallegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nGiven the length of time that has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s Adderall use triggered \na positive test for amphetamines, and the fact that she ultimately was re-prescribed \nAdderall to help with her schoolwork, I conclude that subparagraph 1.b no longer poses \na security concern. I resolve this subparagraph in her favor.  \nAfter testing positive for amphetamines, Applicant falsely explained that she \nreceived the Adderall from a friend, rather than from a previous prescription, as alleged \nin subparagraph 1.c, but did so, based upon the advice of her supervisor. Consequently, \nalthough AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to this subparagraph, it is mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(b),\u201dthe refusal \nor failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed \nto by advice of legal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities for advising \nor instructing the individual specifically concerning security processes.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant stated in her 2020 interrogatory response that she was prescribed \nAdderall in 2009 when she was 19, when in truth, she was prescribed Adderall when she \nwas in middle school. In 2021, she provided a letter from her current physician setting \nforth the amount of Adderall prescribed per day and the length of time that the current \nphysician has been monitoring her Adderall use. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nthat Applicant did not intend to mislead the government when she responded to the \ninterrogatory question in 2020. I resolve subparagraph 1.f in her favor. \nThe remaining SOR allegations remain problematic. Specifically, Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana on a random drug test administered by her employer in May 2016, \nless than 18 months after beginning the job and signing a waiver not to abuse drugs, and \napproximately a year after she had been administratively separated from the military after \ntesting positive for drugs. AG \u00b616(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of rule violations,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony of how her marijuana use was prompted by her struggle with \novercoming PTSD, and the ineffectiveness of other prescribed drugs to treat its symptoms \nwas emotionally compelling; however, it was undercut by her incredible testimony that \nshe was unaware that marijuana was illegal in the state where she used it, and her \ncontradictory explanations provided during the investigative process, for using marijuana. \nConsequently, with the exception of the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d which applies because of her civic volunteerism, none of the \nother mitigating conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant deserves credit for her extraordinary volunteerism and her strong work \nperformance. These factors certainly weigh in her favor when assessing the presence of \nrehabilitation. Conversely, Applicant\u2019s testimony that she was unaware marijuana was \nillegal in the state where she used it in 2015 was not only incredible, it undercut other \nviable mitigating testimony, and created a lingering doubt concerning whether she should \nbe granted a security clearance. Because any doubt must be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity (AG \u00b6 2(b)), I conclude that Applicant\u2019s security clearance application must be \ndenied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph    1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E.

The case was forwarded to the DOHA hearing office on February \n4, 2022, and assigned to me on September 8, 2022. On September 21, 2022, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for November 1, 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 (including GE 2a and 2b), which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nE, which were admitted without objection. \nI held the record open to allow her the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments, which she did. On November 15, 2022, Applicant submitted a narrative \nstatement by email (AE F) and 50 pages of additional documents. Those documents are \nmarked as AE G through AE M and admitted without objection. She also sought and \nreceived more time to submit additional materials. On November 25, 2022, she \nsubmitted seven additional documents, which are marked as AE N through AE T and \nadmitted without objection. (An eighth document was already in evidence). On \nNovember 28, 2022, Department Counsel indicated that she had no objections to \nadmission of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, but she submitted post-hearing \ncomments that I have considered. (Hearing Exhibit (HE IV). The record closed on \nNovember 29, 2022. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn her handwritten Answer, Applicant admitted Guideline SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.o, \nand 1.p. She denied her student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 1.n) noting that they were now \ncurrent. She admitted both Guideline J allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). As noted, the \nfirst answer did not address the Guideline E allegations. \nIn her second, typed Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted Guideline F \nallegations SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.p, with a general explanation. She admitted the Guideline J \nallegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, with explanations. Under Guideline E. she \u201cadmitted\u201d \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c, three falsification allegations, but with explanations that I construe as \ndenials. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.

It showed over $76,000 in delinquent debts. \n(GE 3). Applicant submitted her SCA in August 2019. (GE 1) \nApplicant is 40 years old. She is not married. She has two adult children (ages 22 \nand 23) and a 10-year-old child, for whom she receives child support. Her eldest and \nyoungest children live with her. Applicant graduated high school in 2000 and has some \ncollege education. She is currently taking college courses (and has student loans, \ndiscussed below). (Tr. 43-44, 98-99, 124-126; GE 1) \nApplicant worked sporadically during 2009, and then worked for a contractor for \nabout a year, from 2010 to 2011. She was wrongfully terminated from that job after she \nbecame pregnant. She did not work for about the next year, while home with her \ndaughter. From 2012 to 2015, Applicant worked a variety of jobs with various \ncontractors. Since 2018, she has worked for a DOD contractor as a travel manager. \nShe began her career as an administrative assistant and has worked her way up from \nthere. She has an annual salary of about $100,000. She has had a clearance since \nabout 2009. (Tr. 40-48, 66-67, 98-100; GE 1; AE D, AE L) \nThe financial allegations in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.p) relate to delinquent federal \nstudent loans (just under $60,000), plus about $19,000 in consumer debts and other \ndelinquencies. The debts are established by credit reports from December 2019 (GE 5), \nand October 2020 (GE 6), and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. Many of the debts are also \nlisted on earlier credit reports, from May 2019 (GE 3), July 2019 (GE 4), pulled during \nthe CEP, and by the November 2019 credit report (GE 2b) as well. \nApplicant blamed her financial troubles on \u201cjust not being smart with money, \n[and] not being responsible\u201d in paying her bills on time. She stated that she makes more \nmoney now and is able to address her debts and be more responsible. (Tr. 52, 133) \nApplicant enrolled many of her debts in a debt consolidation program. (AE E, AE\nS) She claimed she started the program in either 2019 (Tr. 73) or in late 2021, (Tr. 58) \nbut she admitted she was \u201cguessing\u201d about the date. (Tr. 123-124) She said the \ncompany takes $350 twice a month. She later documented a list of creditors enrolled in \nthe program, with balances due. (Tr. 58-61; AE F, AE O) AE T includes 2022 account \nstatements from company GH. Applicant enrolled in the company in March 2021, and \nAE T appears to show payments to creditors, so it may be a statement from the debt \nrelief company though this is not clear. (AE T) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($12,071) is the account for a repossessed motorcycle. The amount \nalleged is what was charged off after the motorcycle was sold at auction. (GE 5, GE 6; \nTr. 54, 67-68) Applicant purchased the bike in 2014. She stopped making payments on \nthe bike, in about 2016, because she did not want it anymore.

(GE 5) Applicant said she was unaware of these debts because she had \nmedical insurance. She contacted the hospital\u2019s collection office but was not able to \nresolve the debts. She stated that she intends to pay them. (Tr. 79-82, 131) The debt at \n\u00b6 1.d is enrolled in the debt relief program but no settlement has been reached.

All of these citations are traffic infractions but for driving without a \nlicense or driving with a suspended license, which are misdemeanor offenses. (GE 7, \nTr. 112-113) The most recent citation was issued in October 2017, not October 2019. \nApplicant admitted the violations. She said she sometimes drove too fast on her \nmotorcycle, and most of her traffic tickets came during that period. She returned the \nmotorcycle (in a voluntary repossession) after a close friend died in a motorcycle \naccident. (Tr. 52-53) As part of her deferred adjudication for the marijuana citation, \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was restricted (to and from work, school, a court-ordered \nfacility, and while transporting a minor child). This restriction ran from February 2014 to \nMay 2014. (GE 8) \nAs to the expired inspections, Applicant stated she knew that at the time she was \ndriving a car that would not pass inspection. She acknowledged knowing that she \nshould not have done this. (Tr. 114) Due to her traffic tickets, her license was \nsuspended in 2014 for a few months. (Tr. 64-65) Since about August of last year, \nApplicant leases a used luxury truck. She pays $605 per month. Her driver\u2019s license is \ncurrent.

She had \ntwo opportunities to do so: 1) in answer to the first \u201cseven-year\u201d question detailed in \nSOR \u00b6 3.a (and also arguably the second, since it was a drug offense, though she was \ncited and not \u201ccharged\u201d); and 2) in answer to the second \u201chave you EVER\u201d question \ndetailed in SOR \u00b6 2.b. (Applicant did not use marijuana with a clearance, but \npossession of marijuana constitutes \u201cillegal involvement\u201d with it.) She was not engaged \nin the sale, distribution, cultivation, etc., of marijuana, as called for in the other question \nunder SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant asserted that she did not report the offense because it was outside the \nseven-year scope of the question. (Tr. 50-51, 118); She also asserted that she did not \nreport the offense because it had been dismissed. (Tr. 50-51; Answer) She \nacknowledged that the investigator knew about the arrest during her interview. (Tr. 52) \nShe also acknowledged that she did not want to lose her job. She now understands that \nshe should have listed the citation, since it was six years before her August 2019 SCA, \nand was also a drug offense. (Tr. 120) \nApplicant did not disclose her debts on her SCA. She said she did not disclose \nthem because she was paying on them and therefore did not believe they were \ndelinquent. (Tr. 61) She first acknowledged that some of her debts were delinquent \nwhen she filled out her SCA, (Tr. 62) but later said she did not believe they were \ndelinquent because \u201cthey were in the program to be paid.\u201d (Tr. 123) Applicant asserted \nthat the motorcycle debt was not delinquent when she prepared her SCA because it \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas being paid through the debt relief program, which she said she started in 2019.

(Tr. 72-73) \nIn Applicant\u2019s background interview summary, she discusses her debts at length, \nbut not before she was confronted about many of them. She also discussed many of the \ntraffic infractions in SOR \u00b6 2.a. The marijuana citation is not discussed, either by \nApplicant or the interviewer. (GE 2a) \nApplicant provided a reference letter from a co-worker. Applicant is regarded as a \nhard worker, and she is polite and respectful. She carries herself with \u201clevelheadedness \nand grace.\u201d She possesses the character and judgment of someone working for the \nbetterment of the community. (AE M) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by her admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record, from 2019 and 2020. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a long history of incurring delinquent debts. Her divorce was \nfinalized in May 2021. Some of her debts have been paid and some are being resolved \nthrough a debt relief service. However, the bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, \nincluding her student loans and the motorcycle repossession. She has undertaken few \nsteps to address them. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, ongoing, and not isolated, and they \nare largely due to her own poor decisions, and not to circumstances beyond her control. \nShe has not established that her financial behavior is unlikely to recur or no longer casts \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant keeps an informal budget but has not pursued formal credit \ncounseling. Her debts are also not under control or being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant has undertaken some effort to pay or resolve her debts. But the debt \nfor the repossessed motorcycle remains unresolved after many years. Applicant has not \nundertaken responsible, good-faith effort to address her student loans. Applicant needs \nto establish more of a track record of steady payments towards her debts to establish \ngood faith. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nIn 2014, Applicant was cited for possession of marijuana. The marijuana was \nfound in her home, in the closet of her young son, who was in junior high school. She \npled no contest to keep her son out of trouble. The case was resolved through a \ndeferred adjudication program and dismissed a year later. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to that \noffense, in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nMost of the allegations grouped into SOR \u00b6 2.a are traffic infractions, as shown \nin GE 7. As such, they are not established as criminal conduct. The exceptions are the \ntwo citations for driving with a license or driving on a suspended license, which are \nmisdemeanors, as detailed in GE 7. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to those citations only. No \nGuideline J disqualifying conditions otherwise apply to the infractions at SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe established instances of criminal conduct are quite dated, as they occurred \nabout eight years ago. There is no indication of subsequent criminal citations or charges \nso the issues are also isolated to that timeframe. Applicant accepted responsibility for \nthe marijuana to keep her young son out of trouble and the other two misdemeanors \nconcern driving without a license or driving on a suspended license, a circumstance that \nmay stem from her requirements in deferred adjudication for the marijuana citation. No \nsubsequent criminal charges or citations are evident. Applicant has been gainfully \nemployed ever since. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. Criminal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe personal conduct allegations in this case all concern Applicant\u2019s August \n2019 SCA. The first two allegations of falsification concern her omission of the June \n2013 citation for marijuana possession. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 3.a, Applicant should have listed the offense in answer to the \n\u201cseven-year\u201d question under Section 22, Police Record, since she received a citation to \ngo to court. It was also a drug offense, so she should have disclosed it then as well. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 3.b, Applicant should have also disclosed the offense because it \nconstituted \u201cillegal involvement\u201d with a drug or controlled substance (though not \u201cuse\u201d) \nwhile she held a clearance. \nHowever, I find that Applicant did not deliberately fail to disclose the offense. I \nfind that she believed it was outside the \u201cseven-year\u201d scope of the first question, and \nshe thought she did not have to disclose it since it was dismissed. The fact that she pled \nno contest to a misdemeanor drug citation to keep her young son out of trouble is also \nbelievable. I find that as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, deliberate falsification is not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to those allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are a different matter. Applicant has a long history of delinquent \ndebts. Indeed, her investigation began because credit reports gathered through the \nContinuous Evaluation Program revealed numerous delinquencies, in 2019. Applicant \nalso acknowledged that she knew about many of her delinquencies when she submitted \nher August 2019 SCA, yet she reported none of them. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.c. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment of falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to acknowledge her debts \nbefore being confronted. Falsification of a security clearance application is not a minor \nissue, and it casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) nor 17(c) applies. Established personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has a long history of financial delinquencies she has only recently \nbegun to address. She has extensive student loans and other debts to address, and she \nhas yet to set forth a reasonable plan for addressing them. Applicant also failed to \ndisclose any of her numerous debts on her SCA. While criminal conduct security \nconcerns are dated and resolved, security concerns about her finances and personal \nconduct are not mitigated or resolved. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1: Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.p:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He filed for bankruptcy protection shortly after his receipt of \nthe SOR, and it remains pending as of the close of the record. He did not sufficiently \nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 23, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), and \nGuideline E (personal conduct). The CAF took action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 17, 2022 response to the SOR (Answer), he admitted all 14 \nSOR allegations under Guideline F, and he denied the single cross-allegation under \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, because he mistakenly thought it concerned falsification.

He requested \na decision by a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge \nbased upon the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Answer) \nOn October 24, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM) and provided a complete copy to Applicant. The FORM includes Government \nexhibits (Items) 1 through 13. On October 27, 2022, Applicant received the FORM and its \nattachments. He did not submit a response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt. He did \nnot raise any objections to the admissibility of any of the Items. The case was assigned \nto me on January 26, 2023 and the record closed. I have admitted Items 1 through 13 \ninto evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He married his first wife in 2006 and was divorced in \n2009. He has been married to his second wife since August 2011. He has a 17-year-old \nson. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and a master\u2019s degree in 2017. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Air Force and served on active duty from September 2006 until his medical \nseparation in October 2011, under honorable conditions. He has worked for federal \ncontractors since 2012, and he was granted a top secret security clearance that same \nyear. Since April 2017, he has been employed as a database administrator for a federal \ncontractor. (Items 3 and 4) \nApplicant received the SOR in February 2022. The first ten allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.j, allege delinquent debts totaling $53,247. Applicant disclosed during his \nMarch 2019 background interview that beginning in 2017, his wife had a medical issue \nthat caused numerous unexpected medical bills. In addition, his wife was laid off by her \nemployer, which also contributed to their financial problems. In June 2018, his wife found \nfull-time employment, which significantly helped in their efforts to pay off their debts. They \nhave made a conscious effort to reduce their spending, focus on paying bills, and reducing \ntheir entertainment expenses, such as going out to the casino for date night. Applicant \nalso admitted in his Answer that he did not handle the family finances well during the time \ntheir bills became delinquent. (Items 2 and 4)  \nOn March 22, 2022, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. His \nChapter 13 plan, which was confirmed by the court on June 14, 2022, requires him to \nmake 60 monthly payments of about $1,900. His payment plan to the trustee will continue \nuntil mid-2027, and at that time any remaining unsecured nonpriority debts can be \ndischarged. (Item 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges that Applicant issued a check in the amount of $200, that was \nreturned for insufficient funds, and referred for collection. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. alleges that between 2016 and 2018, Applicant repeatedly engaged in \ncheck kiting by presenting over $100,000 in checks without sufficient funds. The financial\nscheme also included him making ATM withdrawals and cash deposits. Applicant, using\ntwo different bank accounts, took advantage of the fact that a financial institution takes\ndays to process a check. Check kiting, by definition, is the illegal practice involving the\nfraudulent use of a financial instrument to obtain additional credit that is not authorized,\nor for which there are insufficient funds. He stopped in 2018, after the bank admonished \nhim for his involvement in deceptive financial practices. Both of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6\n1.b and 1.n.) were cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide many details or documentation about the current status \nof his delinquent debts. Department Counsel reported, however, that many of these \ndetails can be gleaned from his bankruptcy paperwork in the record. According to \nApplicant\u2019s April 18, 2022 Bankruptcy Schedule D, the amount he owed on his delinquent \nmortgage, $174,701, is the same amount he owed in September 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) He \ndid reduce three of the debts, such as SOR \u00b6 1.d ($8,830 which was reduced to $8,030); \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($11,272 which was reduced to $9,172), and SOR \u00b6 1.f (originally $1,651 now \n$51). The Bankruptcy Schedule E/F indicates that the outstanding amounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, remain unchanged. (Items 1 and 6) \nApplicant admitted in his Answer that he had not filed his state or Federal income \ntax returns for 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l.) He also admitted he had unpaid Federal taxes \n(amount not alleged) for tax year 2019, and he listed that he had arranged a payment \nplan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He did not provide supporting \ndocumentation of the IRS payment agreement, or any recorded payments. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) \nAccording to the Bankruptcy Schedule E/F, he declared that he owed a combined total \namount of $6,962 in delinquent Federal income taxes for 2019 and 2020 together. (Items \n2 and 6) \nApplicant admitted to gambling and he acknowledged that he made approximately \n$20,000 of cash withdrawals at one or more casinos, between 2016 to 2018, the period \nhe was involved in check kiting. He estimated that he visited a casino once or twice per \nmonth from 2015 through 2018, spending as much as $100 to $200 per visit. In 2019 and \n2020, he increased his visits to casino(s) every weekend, spending approximately $200 \nper visit. He also stated in his December 2020 response to interrogatories that he had \nreported gambling losses on two other income tax returns, but he was unable to find the \ntax records. The bankruptcy records indicate that his gambling losses totaled $23,056 in \n2021. (Items 4, 5 and 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators;  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n(g) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, \nincrease in net worth, or money transfers that are inconsistent with known \nlegal sources of income; and \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the March 2022 bankruptcy records, and credit reports in \nevidence support the financial security concerns alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), \n19(c), 19(d), 19(e), 19(f), 19(g), and 19(h) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolve or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to circumstances beyond his control \u2013 \nhis wife had a medical issue that caused numerous unexpected medical bills in 2017. In \naddition, his wife was unemployed until June 2018, which also contributed to their \nfinancial complications. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must not only establish \ncircumstances beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems, he must also \ndemonstrate that he acted responsibly to address and resolve her delinquent accounts. \nFrom approximately 2016 to 2018, Applicant became involved in check kiting, \npresenting over $100,000 in checks between two banking institutions, when those checks \ndid not have sufficient funds. Following an investigation by the bank, he was admonished \nto cease this deceptive scheme. There is no evidence that he has engaged in this conduct \nsince 2018. Even so, his decision to engage in dishonest conduct during a financial \nsetback and while he was engaged in habitual gambling casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment in the overall picture of his financial management \nover the years. \nApplicant and his wife have been fully employed since June 2018. He stated \nduring his March 2019 background interview that her employment was allowing them to \naddress and resolve their delinquent bills.

This money might have been used to \nhelp resolve about half of the debts alleged in the SOR. He also admitted reporting \ngambling losses on two other income tax returns, but he was unable to find the tax \nrecords. \nApplicant has not filed his 2018 state and Federal income tax returns. He claimed \nto have a payment plan in place with the IRS for his 2019 delinquent taxes, but he failed \nto provide supporting documentation. He declared past-due taxes for tax years 2019 and \n2020 in his pending March 2022 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. \nApplicant was aware of the Government\u2019s concern with his financial problems \nafter his background interview in March 2019. He told the investigator that he and his wife \nwere addressing their financial obligations. There is evidence of some payments on three \nSOR debts that continue to have outstanding balances. He has not sufficiently explained \nwhy he has not been able to make better progress over the years in addressing his \ndelinquent debts. \nApplicant received the SOR in February 2022, and he filed for bankruptcy in March \n2022. His Chapter 13 plan requires him to make 60 monthly payments of $1,900 to the \nbankruptcy trustee, which should end in mid-2027. There is insufficient evidence available \nto support that Applicant will be able, or willing, to make all of the monthly payments over \nthe next four years, especially considering his penchant for gambling. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Overall, I find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflect poorly \non his reliability and trustworthiness. Guideline F security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case relating to Applicant\u2019s dishonored check and check kiting \npractices, as set forth below: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n     (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \nThe SOR alleges and the record establishes that Applicant has a dishonored \ncheck that is unresolved, and he was involved in checking kiting from 2016 to 2018, by \npresenting over $100,000 in checks that did not have sufficient funds. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) \napplies. \nAG \u00b6 17 lists a potential condition that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s check kiting stopped in 2018, after he was confronted by the bank. \nApproximately five years have passed since he was involved in check kiting. There is one \ninstance of writing a dishonored check in the SOR; however, the date he wrote the check \nis unknown. I find that enough time has passed without repeated incidents, and that future \ndishonest financial practices are unlikely to recur. Personal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E and \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were triggered, in part, by circumstances beyond \nhis control. His financial problems related to his fondness for gambling is certainly a \ncircumstance fully within his power and control. Whether he exerts that control, especially \nafter being placed on notice in March 2019 that he had a significant number of delinquent \naccounts to resolve, is an important detail to note. Applicant disclosed that in 2019 and \n2020, he had increased his visits to the casino(s), spending about $200 on each visit. In \n2021, his gambling losses of $23,056, were reported on his 2021 income tax return. He \nalso admitted he had reported gambling losses on two other income tax returns, but the \namounts and specific tax years were unknown. He failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly, such as using his gambling money to go towards paying his outstanding \ncreditors. He did not sufficiently mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.n.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not make an affirmative \ndetermination that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to continue to have access to classified information. The adjudicators made that \ndetermination in accordance with Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section \nE.4, and Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), \nSection 4.2. \nOn January 25, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse (Guideline H). The guideline cited in the SOR is one \nof the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, and effective for all security clearance adjudications on or after June \n8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on June 9, 2022, and I scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2022. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between June \n2001 and December 2018 (SOR 1.a), and that between January 2012 and December \n2018, his marijuana use occurred while he had access to classified information (SOR \n1.b). In response to the SOR (Answer 1), Applicant admitted in part and denied in part \nboth allegations. \nOn September 6, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding \nadditional allegations of fact that raised security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct (Guideline E). Applicant responded to the amended SOR on September 9, 2022 \n(Answer 2) and requested a continuance, to which the Government objected. I overruled \nthe objection and granted Applicant\u2019s request, rescheduling the hearing for September \n22, 2022.  \nUnder Guideline E, the amended SOR alleged that in an e-QIP signed and \nsubmitted on January 9, 2012, Applicant deliberately made a false official statement when \nhe omitted the fact that he had used marijuana between 2001 and 2011 (SOR 2.a); that \nin an e-QIP signed and submitted on December 5, 2012, Applicant deliberately made a \nfalse official statement when he disclosed that he had used marijuana between 2004 and \n2007, when in fact, he had used marijuana between 2001 and 2012 (SOR 2.b); that during \nan interview with a government investigator on January 30, 2013, Applicant deliberately \nmade a false official statement when he stated he had last used marijuana in 2007, when \nin fact, he had used marijuana as recently as October 2012 (SOR 2.c); and that during \nan interview with a government investigator on January 24, 2019, Applicant deliberately \nmade a false official statement when he stated he had last used marijuana in June 2018, \nwhen in fact, he had used marijuana as recently as December 2018 (SOR 2.d).

Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 - 5. Department Counsel also provided a copy of a Discovery Letter to \nApplicant, dated November 24, 2020, and a Government\u2019s Exhibit List. They are included \nin the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. Applicant and two other \nwitnesses testified. Applicant also proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A - F. A list of \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits is included as HX 3, and the SOR Amendments and Applicant\u2019s \nresponses thereto are included in the record together as HX 4. I received a hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 5, 2022. \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of GX 4 on grounds that it did not meet the \nadmissibility requirements of Section E3.1.20 of the Directive. I sustained the objection \nand Department Counsel withdrew GX 4. (Tr. 14 \u2013 15). I admitted the remaining exhibits \nfrom both parties without objection. \nGX 4 was a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant by a \ngovernment investigator on January 3, 2013. In SOR 2.c, the Government alleged that \nApplicant deliberately made false statements during that PSI regarding his alleged illegal \nuse of marijuana. After the Government had presented its information in support of the \nSOR (GX 1, 2, 3, and 5) and rested its case, Applicant moved at the beginning of his \ncase-in-chief to strike SOR 2.c based on the exclusion of GX 4. After hearing from both \nparties regarding Applicant\u2019s request, I took the motion under advisement while Applicant \npresented his exhibits and witnesses. At the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s case, he renewed \nhis motion to strike. Department Counsel acknowledged there was no other basis for SOR \n2.c and did not object to Applicant\u2019s motion. Accordingly, I amended the SOR by deleting \nSOR 2.c, leaving intact SOR 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d. (Tr. 21 \u2013 23, 112 \u2013 113).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to allegations under \nboth Guidelines H and E, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. \nIn 2002, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science. In 2013, he earned a master\u2019s \nof business administration (MBA). In January 2012, he went to work for a federal \ncontractor in an information technology (IT) position that required eligibility for a security \nclearance. He worked there until July 2016, when he started working for his current \nemployer, also a federal contractor, in a position that also requires access to classified \ninformation. (GX 1; Tr. 43 \u2013 46) \nApplicant has had access to classified information since 2012. He first applied for \na security clearance by submitting an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on January 9, 2012 (e-QIP #1; admitted as GX 5).

(GX 1; GX 3; GX 5) \nApplicant was married from September 2011 until finalizing a divorce in May 2013. \nHe and his ex-wife separated sometime in 2012. In October 2012, Applicant obtained \nwhat he termed a legal separation, and then proceeded through a contentious and bitter \ndivorce. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife reportedly abused alcohol and was often abusive towards \nhim. The divorce caused Applicant to endure significant personal, physical, financial, and \npsychological stress. Since 2017, he has been in a committed relationship with a woman \nto whom he now is engaged, and with whom he has two children. (Answer 1; GX 1; Tr. \n48, 53 \u2013 55) \nApplicant first used marijuana at age 17 in 2001 while on a student trip abroad. He \nnext used in 2004, while in college, and between 2007 and 2010 with friends in social \nsettings. Available information shows he did not use marijuana again until October 2012. \nAt that time, he began using marijuana as a means to cope with the stressors of his \nseparation and pending divorce. He was having trouble sleeping because of related \nanxiety, and his doctor prescribed him different medications to address his condition. He \navers that the medications either were ineffective or had significant side effects that \nimpeded his ability to function at home and at work. He chose to use marijuana as a \nreplacement for the prescribed medications and for about the next two years, he used \nfrequently each week. Applicant obtained marijuana from a friend with whom he had \nworked in 2009 and 2010, receiving small amounts of marijuana from that friend in \nexchange for doing chores and odd jobs for him. Applicant often used marijuana with that \nfriend. This arrangement and Applicant\u2019s frequency of use lasted until about May 2014, a \nyear after his divorce, when the friend moved away. At all times during this period of drug \nuse, Applicant had access to classified information. In e-QIP #2, submitted in December \n2012, despite the fact that he had been using marijuana frequently each week for the \npreceding two months, he stated he had last used marijuana in 2007 and that he had \nused it a total of about five times. At hearing, he conceded he intentionally omitted \ninformation about his drug use from e-QIP #2. (Answer 1; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 48 \u2013 60, 69, 75 \n\u2013 77) \nWhen Applicant submitted e-QIP #1 in January 2012, he did not disclose that he \nhad used marijuana during the preceding seven years; however, when he submitted e-\nQIP #2 in December 2012, he disclosed that he had used marijuana \u201csocially a few times \nin college and grad school\u201d between 2004 and 2007. Also in that application, he denied \nany future intent to use marijuana, stating \u201cI do not have any need or use for it and will \nnot jeopardize my way of life.\u201d In e-QIP #2, he did not mention that, two months earlier, \nhe had begun using marijuana more frequently to cope with the breakup of his marriage. \n(GX 3 and 5) \nIn June 2018, Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e were travelling with friends in a state where \nrecreational use of marijuana is legal.

(Answer 1; \nGX 2; Tr. 59 \u2013 60, 104 \u2013 105) \nApplicant submitted e-QIP #3 on November 21, 2018. In response to questions in \nSection 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity), he disclosed that he used marijuana \nbetween October 2012 and June 2018, and that he had used in social settings about five \ntimes \u201csince days of regular use,\u201d by which he meant the period between October 2012 \nand May 2014.

I have developed proven routines and \nactivities that help alleviate stress and have a positive relationship for which the stress of \nthe past is no longer present.\u201d In contrast to his reported five instances of marijuana use \nafter 2014, Applicant testified that he only used marijuana twice after 2014 \u2013 in June and \nDecember 2018.

During that interview, he \nreported he first used marijuana in October 2012 and last used marijuana in June 2018. \nOn July 5, 2019, a government investigator conducted two follow-up interviews with \nApplicant about his drug use. In the first July 5 interview, Applicant reported that he used \nmarijuana with the person from whom he obtained the marijuana an average of four nights \na week over an average of three weeks monthly. After his source of marijuana moved \naway, he smoked marijuana in social settings or parties if someone offered it to him. \nDuring the first July 5 interview, he also disclosed his use of marijuana on December 31, \n2018. He stated that he only used marijuana that night because he was intoxicated. \nDuring the interview, he stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because \nhe now has good sleep habits, he meditates, and he is in a good relationship with his \nfianc\u00e9e. (GX 2) \nThe summary report of the July 5, 2019 PSI does not indicate that Applicant \nexplained why he had not disclosed his December 2018 marijuana use when discussing \nhis drug use during a PSI less than a month after his last use. Applicant denied SOR 2.d, \nwhich alleged that he intentionally made a false official statement to the government by \nfailing to disclose his most recent drug use during the January 2019 PSI. In response to \nthe SOR and at hearing, he stated that he did not disclose smoking marijuana at the \nDecember 2018 New Year\u2019s Eve party because he was so intoxicated that night he did \nnot remember doing so. He claimed it was not until the spring of 2019, as he was \ndiscussing his drug use with a friend whom he had listed as a reference in e-QIP #3, \nSection 16 (People You Know Well) that he recalled his December 2018 use. That friend \nwas the same person who hosted the New Year\u2019s Eve party, and according to Applicant, \nreminded him that he had used marijuana that evening.

(Tr. 110 - 111) \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant presented 19 letters of \nsupport, all attesting to his good character, reliability, and trustworthiness. (AX A) He also \npresented a series of lab reports that show he tested negative for controlled substances \nthrough hair and urine tests each month between May 2021 and August 2022 (AX B) In \nApril 2021, he completed a marijuana education class that discusses the chemistry and \nlegalities associated with marijuana.

The witness also reported that Applicant is largely self-\ntaught in most of his IT skills, and that he is honest and trustworthy. The witness is aware \nof Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana to cope with divorce-related stress, but acknowledged that \nhis drug use thereafter was a stupid mistake. (Tr. 29 \u2013 43) \nApplicant insists that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. To that end, \nhe presented a notarized statement of intent (AX E) in which he acknowledged that any \nfuture drug use might be grounds for revocation of any clearance he holds. Applicant also \ntestified that he no longer associates with persons who use marijuana, and that he leads \na lifestyle that is conducive to continued abstinence. By contrast, the personal reference \nwho he claims refreshed his recollection about his December 2018 marijuana use is \nsomeone with whom Applicant has smoked marijuana in the past, and who hosted the \nNew Year\u2019s Eve party. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e characterized that party as a gathering of \u201cvery, \nvery close friends.\u201d As of the July 2019 PSIs, Applicant was in contact with that person \nabout quarterly. (GX 2; Tr. 91 \u2013 93, 94 \u2013 95, 105) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.\n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant used illegal drugs between 2001 and 2018. Between 2012 and 2018, his \ndrug use occurred while he had access to classified information. This information \nreasonably raises the security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires the application of the following AG \n\u00b6 25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana socially between 2001 and 2012. Between October 2012 \nand May 2014, he used it frequently each week for three weeks on average out of every \nmonth. He claimed in his Answer and at hearing that he did not use again until June 2018; \nhowever, in e-QIP #3, he stated that he used marijuana another five times in social \nsettings before consuming edibles with his fianc\u00e9e in June 2018. Finally, his last known \nuse of marijuana occurred on December 31, 2018. Starting in 2012, his illegal drug use \noccurred after receiving a security clearance. At several points in his testimony, he \naffirmed that he had access to classified information. In his December 2012 e-QIP #2, \nApplicant stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future; however, he had been \nusing it frequently for about two months when he submitted that application, and he \ncontinued to use it frequently for much of the next two years, then less frequently between \n2014 and 2018. \nAll of the foregoing supports application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(f), and 25(g). By \ncontrast, the following AG \u00b6 26 mitigating conditions are pertinent here: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has not used marijuana since \nDecember 2018. This period of abstinence can be significant. The height of his drug use \noccurred while he was going through a difficult divorce and he turned to marijuana \nbecause the medications his doctor prescribed seemed to do more harm than good. \nThose circumstances have not recurred in the past eight years. After his divorce, his \npersonal life became more stable, productive, and free of the stressors he experienced \nbefore May 2013. Nonetheless, Applicant continued to use marijuana on a frequent basis \nuntil May 2014, when his supplier moved away. Thereafter, he continued to use \nmarijuana, albeit less frequently, in social settings until December 2018. Applicant has \nbeen in a committed and stable relationship since the summer of 2016, yet his marijuana \nuse continued. The consumption of edibles containing THC in June 2018 was a choice \nhe and his fianc\u00e9e made while traveling with friends. His drug use in December 2018 was \narguably the product of intoxication. Available information does not show that his drug \nuse before October 2012 and after May 2013 was the product of any unusual \ncircumstances. Because his illegal use of marijuana over the past ten years has occurred \nwhile he has had access to classified information, his decision to use illegal drugs reflects \nadversely on Applicant\u2019s judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nAs to AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2), Applicant\u2019s last use occurred while at a party with \npersons who, according to his fianc\u00e9e, are very close friends of theirs. Additionally, his \nuse of edibles occurred while traveling with his fianc\u00e9e and their friends. At least as \nrecently as December 2018, Applicant\u2019s circle of friends included people who use \nmarijuana on a social basis. One of the persons with whom Applicant has used marijuana \nin the past is listed as a personal reference in his most recent e-QIP, and, according to \nthe summary of his July 5 PSIs, is someone with whom Applicant has had contact at least \non a quarterly basis. The record does not support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2). \nAs to AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), Applicant presented a signed statement averring that he will \nno longer use marijuana, and that he understands that any future use might result in \nrevocation of his eligibility for access to classified information. Generally, such a written \ncommitment in combination with an acceptable period of abstinence would inure to his \nbenefit. However, Applicant previously has stated his future intent to abstain, yet even as \nhe made those statements, he was using marijuana, at times, frequently. Applicant was \nless than credible when discussing his marijuana use and he has made inconsistent \nstatements about his drug use in previous background investigations. At his hearing, he \ntestified that he did not disclose his December 2018 use in his January 2019 PSI because \nhe forgot about it until a friend refreshed his recollection of it several months later. This \ndoes not appear to be true, because his fianc\u00e9e testified that he told her the night of the \nparty that he had used marijuana around the bonfire. On balance, available information \nprobative of Applicant\u2019s future intent in this matter does not persuade me that he will not \nuse marijuana again. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) does not apply. Based on all of the foregoing, I \nconclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s \ninformation about his illegal drug use. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern about personal conduct is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, the following AG \u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions pertain to these \nfacts and circumstances: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nIn Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance in January 2012, in response \nto a question about illegal drug use during the preceding seven years, he did not disclose \nhis marijuana use in 2007 (his use in 2004 was outside the scope of the question). In \nOctober 2012, he started using marijuana on a regular basis as a means of coping with \nthe effects from the end of his marriage. In the midst of that conduct, he submitted another \nclearance application in December 2012. Therein, he acknowledged using marijuana \n\u201csocially less than five times\u201d between 2004 and 2007, whereas after October 2012, he \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad been using multiple times weekly. He further stated that he did not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future. After providing that information, he continued his illegal drug use \non a frequent basis until May 2014. \nOn January 24, 2019, less than a month after Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, a \ngovernment investigator interviewed him about his use of illegal drugs. Applicant stated \nthat he first used marijuana in 2012, whereas he actually first used it in 2001. He reported \nhis last use of marijuana was in June 2018, when he and his fianc\u00e9e consumed edibles \ncontaining THC. He did not report his use of marijuana at the New Year\u2019s Eve party until \nhe was re-interviewed on July 5, 2019. Applicant then disclosed his December 2018 but \nnot his pre-2012 use. Later in the day on July 5, Applicant disclosed he had first used in \n2001, as well as his sporadic use between 2010 and 2012. \nApplicant has asserted that during his January 2019 PSI, he did not report his use \non New Year\u2019s Eve because he was so intoxicated he forgot about it until well after the \ninterview. He claims that at some point before the first July 5 interview, one of his \ncharacter references (also the host of the party and someone with whom Applicant has \nused marijuana in the past) reminded him he had used marijuana that night. This claim \nstands in contrast to his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s testimony that she and Applicant discussed his \nmarijuana use on the night of the party. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s claims that he \ndid not remember his December 2018 drug use before the January 2019 PSI. \nAvailable information shows that since 2012, when asked for information about his \ndrug use, Applicant deliberately omitted his drug use or minimized the true extent of his \ndrug use over the past 21 years. As alleged in SOR 2.a and 2.b, this occurred in his first \ntwo security clearance applications. As alleged in SOR 2.d, it occurred in his January PSI. \nAlthough not specifically alleged, in assessing mitigation, I have also considered the \ninconsistencies in both of his July 2019 PSIs. When it comes to deciding in whom to \nrepose its trust, the government has a fundamental and compelling interest in having \naccurate, comprehensive, and truthful reporting of adverse information in a clearance \nholder\u2019s background. Over the past ten years, that has not occurred with regard to \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana and his statements regarding his future intentions. On \nbalance, I conclude none of the pertinent mitigating conditions can apply here. Applicant \ndid not mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information under this \nguideline. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). There is significant positive information in the record about Applicant\u2019s \nperformance and reputation in the workplace. He is accomplished in his area of expertise, \nself-taught in much of his skillset, and is generally well liked for his reliability and hard \nwork, and he appears to be a devoted family man. Nonetheless, the use of marijuana in \nviolation of federal laws against such conduct while possessing a security clearance and \nhaving access to classified information is not a minor concern. Such significant disregard \nfor rules and regulations presents a risk that he would not properly safeguard classified \ninformation. Also of great importance is whether the government can rely on Applicant to \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nbe truthful even if doing so might work against his personal interest. Possession of a \nsecurity clearance entails a fiduciary responsibility that places the government\u2019s interests \nabove one\u2019s own. Despite the positive information in this record, Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nfalsifications about his use of illegal drugs undermine confidence that he will meet that \nobligation. Available information about Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, in combination with \nhis lack of truthfulness about that conduct, sustains the doubts about his clearance \nsuitability raised by the Government\u2019s information. Because protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any such doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nDismissed. \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on February 28, 2022, and received by her on April 27, 2022. The \nFORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel stated, \u201cThe Government, pursuant to \u00b6 \nE3.1.13. of DoD Directive 5220.6, amends the SOR to include subparagraphs 1.t. through \n1.w. to read as follows: . . .,\u201d followed by proposed language alleging that four additional \ncredit accounts totaling $14,749 had been placed for collection and remained delinquent. \nDepartment Counsel requested that Applicant provide an answer to these new allegations \nin her response to the FORM, and that if she failed to do so that the administrative judge \nfind her silence to be a denial of the new allegations. \u00b6 E3.1.13. of DoD Directive 5220.6 \ndeals with advance provision of case documents to the other party; not with amending \nthe SOR, which is covered by \u00b6 E3.1.17. That provision says that the administrative judge, \nnot the department counsel, may amend the SOR at the hearing \u201cto render it in conformity \nwith the evidence admitted or for other good cause.\u201d Accordingly, the SOR has not been \namended by Department Counsel\u2019s purported action in the FORM. Evidence of the \nadditional collection accounts will be considered solely for purposes of analyzing \nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.     \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM with any additional information, did not \nobject to its contents, and did not request additional time to accomplish either act.

(Item 3.) \nApplicant said that her financial problems began after she underwent surgery for \na serious chronic medical condition in July 2018, and was on unpaid leave for five and a \nhalf weeks while she recuperated. She said that she lived off her credit cards while not \nreceiving paychecks, then fell behind on her debts and didn\u2019t know what to do, although \nshe had always paid her bills before her surgery. She did not submit a budget from which \nto determine her living expenses while living in her parent\u2019s home, nor otherwise explain \nhow she accumulated over $49,000 in delinquent credit card debt while off work for just \nover a month. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nThe status of the 22 SOR-alleged debts, totaling $83,892, is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.p \u2013 1.s: After returning to work in August 2018, Applicant \nincurred these eight delinquent medical debts, totaling $3,709, between January 2019 \nand November 2019. The individual amounts due range from $78 to $1,773. She admitted \nowing four of them, totaling $3,316. She denied the other four, totaling $393, because \nshe said she didn\u2019t receive those bills. The existence of all these debts is documented in \nrecord credit reports, and she submitted no evidence of any effort to contact or repay the \ncreditors. These debts remain unresolved. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u2013 1.h, 1.j \u2013 1.o: Applicant last made timely payments toward five of \nthese nine delinquent credit card accounts during July or August 2018, and payments \ntoward the remaining four between December 2018 and November 2019. They have all \nbeen charged off by the creditors, with balances ranging from $1,343 to $10,648, and \ntotaling $49,215. Applicant said, in her Answer, that she repaid two of these debts: SOR \n\u00b6 1.k in 2019 ($1,343), and SOR \u00b6 1.j in 2021 ($8,455); but provided no documentation \nto corroborate this claim. Applicant\u2019s February 22, 2022 credit report stated that the \u00b6 1.j \naccount was paid in September 2021, and it has a $0 balance. However, the \u00b6 1.k account \nwas last reported on February 15, 2022, with an unpaid $1,343 balance on that credit \nreport. She made no apparent effort to resolve the remaining seven delinquent credit card \naccounts, which remain outstanding.

(Item 4.) \nOn January 10, 2018, Applicant entered into a $104,800 joint mortgage loan, \npresumably with her 71-year-old mother whom she lives with and cares for in the longtime \nfamily home. She did not explain the uses to which these funds were put, but her credit \nreport shows that in July 2019 she paid off the seven-year $41,354 car loan she had \nopened in May 2017, rather than use those funds to repay her SOR-listed medical or \nconsumer credit debts. (Item 4.) \nThe record contains no evidence concerning whether Applicant sought financial \ncounseling, her job performance, trustworthiness, or character in a professional setting. \nIt is also silent with respect to her track record in handling sensitive information and \nobservation of security procedures. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or \ncharacter in person, since she elected to have her case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as stated in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nSince undergoing surgery in July 2018 and being on unpaid leave for five and a \nhalf weeks thereafter, Applicant incurred the 19 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, \nwhich total almost $54,500. In September 2021, she repaid the $8,455 credit card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, but the others remain unresolved. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate the resulting security concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under any of these conditions. All but one \nof the multiple delinquent debts of concern remain unresolved, demonstrating current \nunreliability and ongoing potential for financial coercion. She provided no evidence to \ncorroborate her claim that she repaid the $1,343 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, or that she \nobtained and is following professional guidance to establish financial responsibility.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccountable security guard who defaulted on about $54,500 in voluntarily incurred debt \nlisted in the SOR, and more than $13,000 in later delinquencies. She repaid one $8,455 \ncredit card debt, but documented no attempt, workable plan, or available resources to \nresolve her remaining delinquent debts since she resumed her current employment after \nfive and a half weeks of unpaid medical leave during July and August 2018. There \nremains significant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which is likely \nto continue. Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the Financial Considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k through 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

Pakistan's military has carried out \nthree coups since Pakistan's independence in 1947 and as of 2021 remained a dominant \nforce in the country's political arena. In July 2018, Imran Khan took office as prime \nminister after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party won a plurality of seats in the \ngeneral elections. In 2021, Pakistan's chief military focus was on the perceived threat \nfrom India, but over the past 15 years, the military also has increased its role in internal \ncounterinsurgency and counterterrorism missions. Pakistan has been engaged in a \ndecades-long armed conflict with militant groups that target government institutions and \ncivilians, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant networks. \nThe Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is Level 3: Reconsider Travel \nto Pakistan due to terrorism and sectarian violence. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel \nto several areas of the country (Balochistan Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, \nincluding the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas) due to terrorism and \nkidnapping. U.S. citizens are further advised not to travel to the immediate vicinity of the \nIndia-Pakistan border due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict. \nDuring 2021, there was a lack of government accountability, and abuses, including \ncorruption, often went unpunished, fostering a culture of impunity among perpetrators, \nwhether official or unofficial. Authorities seldom punished government officials for \nreported human rights abuses or acts of corruption \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Mar. 29, 2002). \nThe following disqualifying condition under this guideline is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, two \naunts, and an uncle are citizens and residents of Pakistan.

The potential for terrorist and other violence against U.S. interests and citizens \nremains high in Pakistan, and it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant's \nforeign contacts and assets create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. When foreign \nfamily ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2003). The above disqualifying condition has been raised by the evidence. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nI considered the totality of Applicant's ties to Pakistan. Applicant is a loyal U.S. \ncitizen. She currently holds a public trust position giving her access to sensitive \ninformation in order to conduct security background investigations for a federal agency. \nShe came to the United States in 1999 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006. Her children \nwere born in the United States, and her husband became a U.S. citizen 2020. He works \nfor a federal agency in a public trust position. She expressed her allegiance to the United \nStates, which she considers her home. She credibly testified that her relationships with \nher family and in-laws in Pakistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate her into \nrevealing sensitive or classified information. Her relationship with her in-laws was \nconsistent with the cultural norms of Pakistan. \nI find that Applicant's ties to Pakistan are outweighed by her deep and long\u00ad\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. By working in the security field, \nshe is uniquely qualified to understand the threats and mindful what could be used against \nher and can be trusted to act in the favor of the United States. There is no conflict of \ninterest, because she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are applicable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n                      \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, and \npersuasive at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by family ties in Pakistan. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: Paragraph 1, \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence):    \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old. He has been married since 2012. His 16-year-old stepdaughter and 9-year-old daughter still reside in the family home, which he purchased in 2002. He earned an engineering bachelor\u2019s degree in 1994, and earned master\u2019s degrees in aerospace engineering and business administration in, respectively, 1999 and 2007. He began his current employment with a major defense contractor in December 1996, and has held a security clearance since 1999. He has advanced through increasingly responsible positions, and is currently a senior engineering manager. His current duties mostly involve unclassified work on commercial projects, but his supervisors requested him to apply for continued national security eligibility so he could continue his intermittent temporary work advising DoD-support programs on technical, planning, staffing, and budgeting considerations. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 27-32.)

Based upon a review of the record as a whole, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of Case \nOn February 22, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for reinvestigation and continuation of the \nsecurity clearance he held for 20 years while working for a major defense contractor. On \nFebruary 17, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).

He admitted \nthe SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 2.a. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on February 22, 2022. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on April 15, 2022, setting the hearing, at Applicant\u2019s request, \nfor April 21, 2022. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 3 into evidence. Applicant testified, but offered no documentary evidence. All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMay 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 50 years old. He has been married since 2012. His 16-year-old \nstepdaughter and 9-year-old daughter still reside in the family home, which he purchased \nin 2002. He earned an engineering bachelor\u2019s degree in 1994, and earned master\u2019s \ndegrees in aerospace engineering and business administration in, respectively, 1999 and \n2007. He began his current employment with a major defense contractor in December \n1996, and has held a security clearance since 1999. He has advanced through \nincreasingly responsible positions, and is currently a senior engineering manager. His \ncurrent duties mostly involve unclassified work on commercial projects, but his \nsupervisors requested him to apply for continued national security eligibility so he could \ncontinue his intermittent temporary work advising DoD-support programs on technical, \nplanning, staffing, and budgeting considerations. He never served in the military or held \na Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 27-32.) \nShortly after the recreational use of marijuana was legalized under his state\u2019s laws \nin 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife wanted to obtain and try some. Applicant agreed to participate, \nand she brought home an edible and a joint for them to share on a weekend evening. \nApplicant was assigned to commercial projects that involved no classified work during \nthat time, and his company\u2019s drug policies only prohibited being under the influence of, \nor using, alcohol or drugs while at work. It did not occur to him that this experimentation \nat home would have any connection to, or effect on, his security clearance or employment \nso he did not report it to anyone at the time. However, in response to the \u201cIllegal Use of \nDrugs or Controlled Substances\u201d question in Section 23 of his 2019 e-QIP, he \ncommented, \u201cI have used Marijuana once in the past 7 years after it had been legalized \nfor personal use in [his state of residence].\u201d (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 32-35.)    \nApplicant completed most of the entries on his 2019 e-QIP during late 2018, but \ndelayed its submission because he needed to obtain some updated information about \npeople he listed as contacts. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, he responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question \nin Section 23 asking, \u201cWhile Possessing a Security Clearance Have you EVER illegally \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nused or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance other than previously listed?\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) \nAs described above, Applicant had previously listed the 2013 marijuana use that was, at \nthe time he was filling out this section of the e-QIP, the only time he had used it. He also \nexpressed his understanding that this use was not illegal, but he disclosed it to provide \ncomplete information. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 25-26, 32-42.) \nDuring January 2019, Applicant attended a party hosted by a friend of his wife. He \ndid not know any of the other people at the party. When a marijuana pipe was passed \naround the group, he took one or two puffs on it to be sociable. This also occurred on a \nweekend evening during a period when he was exclusively assigned to unclassified \ncommercial projects at work. It did not occur to him in late February, when he completed \nthe contact information on his e-QIP and submitted it, that he needed to add this second \nmarijuana use to his answers in Section 23. During a security interview with a Government \ninvestigator on May 28, 2019, Applicant volunteered the information concerning his 2019 \nmarijuana use without being confronted about it. At no time did he intentionally conceal \nor misrepresent his two incidents of drug involvement. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 25-26, \n35-43.) \nApplicant believes that decriminalization of some controlled substances represents \nsound public policy, and that Federal laws prohibiting marijuana use may be changed to \nmirror the legalization spreading through multiple state law changes. However, he has \nonly used the drug twice, his wife does not regularly use it, and he firmly expressed that \nhe has no desire or intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 2; Tr. 26-27, 44-45.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used small amounts of marijuana on two occasions six years apart. This \nestablishes potential concerns under \u00b6 25(a). Each use occurred during a period when \nhe was solely working on unclassified commercial projects for his employer, involving \nneither access to classified information nor performance of security-sensitive duties. \nHowever, he did hold a DoD security clearance on both occasions, so technically had \nbeen granted eligibility for such access or duties. Accordingly, consideration of \u00b6 25(f) \nconcerns is warranted. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021. \nIn her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant experimented with marijuana once shortly after his state legalized \nrecreational use in 2013, and took one or two puffs on a marijuana pipe as a social gesture \nat a party in January 2019. Applicant has a good job, has abstained from any other \nmarijuana use throughout his life, and evinced a credible intent not to use it in the future. \nHe did not submit a duplicative signed statement of intent, but the guideline cites this as \na non-exclusive manner of demonstrating his acknowledgement and pattern of \nabstinence. Applicant readily acknowledged his infrequent use of marijuana in the past, \nand has established a credible pattern of abstinence since his last use in early 2019. He \ncannot fully disassociate from friends and family members who have occasionally used \nmarijuana, but he declared his intent, subject to Title 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 1001, to abstain \nfrom future drug involvement. \nViewed in the context of the whole person, Applicant mitigated the security \nsignificance of his two incidents of marijuana use. His drug involvement was infrequent, \nstopped more than four years ago, is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Substantial mitigation under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) was established. Other potential mitigating conditions are inapplicable \nin the absence of prescription drug abuse or any recommended form of drug treatment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant disclosed one use of marijuana on his 2019 e-QIP, although he did not \nunderstand it to have been illegal at the time he filled out the form. He failed to mention \nhis second use by mistake, and not through any intent to omit or conceal this information. \nHe freely volunteered the information about the second incident during his security \ninterview to correct this omission. The record evidence clearly establishes that the alleged \nfalsification was either accidental or unintentional, vice a deliberate act that would support \na security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 includes two conditions that would mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, if it had involved a deliberate falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant provided evidence that establishes mitigation under both of the foregoing \nconditions, as discussed above. The omission was a one-time, harmless oversight. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nfully disclosed and consistently demonstrated accountability for his minor misuse of \nmarijuana four and nine years ago. He convincingly demonstrated his intention to abstain \nfrom further substance misuse. This is not a matter of substituting a credibility assessment \nfor the facts of this case. Applicant has been honest and forthright throughout this \nprocess, which is important to establishing and maintaining national security eligibility. \nThat integrity fortifies other strong evidence of his trustworthiness, responsibility, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The potential for pressure, exploitation, \nor duress is minimal since Applicant has voluntarily and fully disclosed his previous \ninvolvement with THC and his intention to abstain from drug involvement in the future. \nRecurrence of substance misuse is not likely, and he made no attempt to conceal it. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the evidence has eliminated any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 37 years old. She attended college from 2015 to 2017 but did not earn a degree. She has two children, ages 16 and 6. She receives $480 monthly in child support for her younger child and no support for the other child. She has worked for federal contractors since 2010, except from October 2017 to October 2018 when she did not work because she stayed home with her younger child. She was supported by her boyfriend during this time and lived with her sister. She explained that she was uncomfortable sending her child to daycare because he initially had some medical needs but admitted later this was her choice. She has worked for her present employer since October 2018. She also had a part-time job working three days a week, along with her full-time job in 2021, but not 2022. At the time of her hearing, she did not have a second job. Post-hearing, she stated that she was hired for a second job and was now earning from the two jobs approximately $129,000 annually.

She attended college from 2015 to 2017 but did not earn \na degree. She has two children, ages 16 and 6. She receives $480 monthly in child \nsupport for her younger child and no support for the other child. She has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2010, except from October 2017 to October 2018 when she did \nnot work because she stayed home with her younger child.

She has worked for her present employer since \nOctober 2018. She also had a part-time job working three days a week, along with her \nfull-time job in 2021, but not 2022. At the time of her hearing, she did not have a second \njob. Post-hearing, she stated that she was hired for a second job and was now earning \nfrom the two jobs approximately $129,000 annually. (Tr. 15- 21, 65; GE 9; AE A, L) \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties after the birth of her second child \nand when she was not working. She used credit cards to supplement her income. Also, \nduring a period of time, she was the only one working when her boyfriend was \nunemployed. She now lives with her sister and they share expenses. She completed a \nsecurity clearance application in February 2017 and disclosed some of her delinquent \ndebts. She was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2019 and acknowledged \nshe had delinquent debts. She was unable to maintain her home and pay her bills so she \nbegan using credit cards. Some of them became delinquent. She told the investigator that \nshe had not made payment arrangements to satisfy the debts. She was pursuing a \nsecond job and intended to satisfy the debts once she did. (Tr. 19-21; GE 9) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f allege Applicant has approximately $21,585 in student \nloans that became delinquent sometime after 2017, when she stopped attending college. \nShe explained that she planned on going back to college, so she did not pay them. She \ntestified she now does not intend to resume college. She said that in 2021 she made one \npayment of $50. She has applied for a student loan forgiveness program.

It showed that, on the day of hearing, she made a \npayment of $587. One other payment was reflected as a refund and Treasury offset in \nMarch 2020 for $7,152. She also provided a copy of her bank statement showing a \npayment made on April 12, 2023, for $587 to DOE. She wrote on the statement that \npayments of $500 will resume each month and she did not have a payment plan due to \nthe pause in the program. (Tr. 31-34, 63-64; AE B, H) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts to the same credit card company that are \nin collection. Applicant testified that she was aware she owed two of the credit card debts \nbut was unfamiliar with the other two. She was confused about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($4,127) but said it was not paid. A judgment was entered for this debt in February 2018. \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided a payment agreement regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nwhich stated that Applicant would pay $1,000 on April 24, 2023, and then make monthly \npayments beginning in May 2023 of $188. It appears Applicant made the first payment. \n(Tr. 23-28 34-35; GE 7; AE F) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided documents from the collection company that \ncorroborates the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($208) and 1.k ($486) are for the same account, \nand it was paid from January to May 2022. She provided another document to show in \nJanuary through March 2022 she made three monthly payments to satisfy the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($413). These debts are resolved. (Tr. 29-31, 34-35, 37; GE 2 - 5; AE C, D, E) \nA judgment was entered in December 2017 for the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i \n($3,815) for $4,649. Applicant complied with a settlement agreement and had a final \npayment due in May 2023. Her April 2020 credit report reflects she defaulted on the debt \nin June 2016. The debt is being resolved. (Tr. 36-37; GE 3, 6; AE G) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h (credit card $1,113) and 1.j ($4,944) became delinquent \nin approximately 2016. Applicant testified that she intends to pay these debts when she \ncompletes her payments with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Post-hearing, Applicant provided \na copy of her bank statement showing a payment of $700 was paid to the creditor in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h on April 12, 2023. She wrote on the statement that this debt was paid off on that \ndate. She did not provide evidence that the creditor agreed to settle the debt and that the \ndebt was settled for less than the full amount. She also provided a copy of a $500 money \norder from April 16, 2023, paid to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.j. She said the creditor does not \nhave payment plans on accounts in collection and the current balance owed is $5,704. \n(Tr. 38; GE 3; AE H, I) \nApplicant testified that when she moved in 2018, she lost track of the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l (communications services $1,459). Post-hearing, she stated that she could not find \nthe collection company holding the account. She was continuing her pursuit.

Post-hearing, she provided a letter \nshowing the debt was settled on April 24, 2023, for $1,000. Applicant admitted being \nresponsible for the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n (medical debt $732) and 1.o (medical \ndebt $243). She said she has contacted the hospital where she believes the debts \noriginated but is having difficulty finding the actual bill. None of these debts are resolved, \nand no documentation was provided to show Applicant disputed any of them. (Tr. 40-41-\n43; GE 1, AE J) \nApplicant has not had any financial counseling or education. She has a budget but \nlives paycheck to paycheck. She testified that recently she received an $10,000 income \ntax refund, she used about $2,000 to pay some debts, and she keeps the remainder as \nan emergency fund. She said she has cut her expenses. (Tr. 43-45) \nApplicant recently had a delinquent medical debt in collection because she had to \ngo to the hospital. Her children receive free medical care through the state, but she opted \nnot to take medical benefits through her employer in exchange for an increase in her \nhourly wage. She paid the delinquent debt in April 2023. She also provided a document \nto show she paid a medical bill for an October 2021 hospital visit that is reported on her \nMarch 2023 credit report but was not alleged in the SOR. These debts are not alleged in \nthe SOR. (Tr. 45-46; GE 5; AE K) \nApplicant and her sister live together and share expenses. Applicant holds the \nmortgage on the house where her parents live. It is in her name. Her parents pay the \nmonthly mortgage payment and all the associated expenses. She understands if they fail \nto do so she is responsible for the mortgage. She does not provide financial support to \nher parents or anyone other than her children. (Tr. 48-53) \nIn 2020, Applicant purchased a new vehicle for $23,000. She traded the car in July \n2021 because its exhaust system was damaged, and she purchased a new 2022 vehicle. \nHer car payments were $700 a month. In February 2023, she traded in her 2022 vehicle \nbecause she hit a pothole and damaged the vehicle. She received approximately $20,000 \nfor the trade-in value of the 2022 car. She financed $68,000 to purchase a 2023 electric \nvehicle. Her monthly car payments are now $1,300 for 72 months. Her commuting \ndistance to work and to pick up her children are each about 12 miles away. (Tr. 53-62, \n67-68) \nApplicant attributed her financial issues to the time she took off from work from \nOctober 2017 to October 2018 to be home with her child, and then she chose not to return \nto work. She stopped paying some of her bills. She testified that she always planned to \npay her debts but can only do so one at a time. (Tr. 66) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, court \ndocuments of judgments, credit reports from March 2019, April 2020, February 2022, and \nMarch 2023.

(GE 1 - 9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns.

There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant began having financial problems in 2016, and they continued when she \ntook off work after the birth of her second child in 2017. She admitted she owed the debts \nalleged in the SOR. Some of her debts were reduced to judgments. Although she could \nhave resumed work, she chose not to, initially because of her child\u2019s medical needs, but \nlater it was by choice. Applicant used credit cards to supplement the loss of income and \nthen was unable to pay them. Her debts are ongoing and unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s time off after pregnancy may have been beyond her control, \nshe admitted that at a certain point it was by choice. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been \nemployed since October 2018. Post-hearing, she made one voluntary payment towards \nher student loans. Her tax refund was applied to her delinquent student loans. Some \ncreditors had to take Applicant to court and get judgments. She chose to purchase an \nexpensive new car, raising her monthly payments by $600, instead of using the money to \nreduce her delinquent debts. This does not project a person who is acting responsibly. \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided documents to show she paid or is paying some of her \ndebts in response to the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling or that her \nfinances are under control.

Applicant made payments on many \nof the accounts alleged in the SOR, but it was after her hearing and in response to the \nsecurity clearance process. This also does not constitute good faith. Although Applicant \nhas paid or settled some of the alleged delinquent debts, she still has others remaining. \nAG\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nThe fact that Applicant has made some payments or has paid some debts \u201cdoes \nnot preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd.

July 7, 2016.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has been employed steadily since 2018 and had a part-time job in 2021. \nShe made some payments on smaller debts and is completing the terms of a settlement \non a judgment entered against her, but she did not begin to take meaningful action on \nmost of her debts until after her hearing. She has not met her burden of persuasion. She \ndoes not have a reliable financial track record. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor these reasons, I conclude that, despite some evidence that some of her debts are \nresolved, it is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l \nAgainst Applicant] \nSubparagraph 1.m \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He began working at his present job in \nJune 2017. He served in the U.S. Army from 1994-2017, retiring as a sergeant first class \n(E-7) with an honorable discharge. While serving in the Army he deployed four times, \nincluding to Iraq twice, Afghanistan, and Africa. He receives disability income from the \nDepartment of Veteran\u2019s Affairs. He has taken some college courses. He is married and \nhas two children. (Tr. 7, 22-23; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1998 \nand 2007. It also alleged 16 delinquent accounts (repossessed cars, consumer debt, \npayday loans, and a utility debt) totaling approximately $31,368. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.r) The \ndebts are established by credit reports from October 2017, April 2019, March 2020, \nSeptember 2020, and August 2022; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator in October 2018; and his SOR admissions. The bankruptcies are established \nby court database records. (GE 2-9; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after he joined the Army in 1994. He stated \nthat he was not savvy with financial matters and got into debt right away. This led him to \nfile his first Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1998. He completed the payment plan approved by \nthe court and his debts were discharged in 2006. He accrued more unpaid debt later in \nhis military career. The payment of that debt was impacted by his deployments in places \nwhere he did not always have ready access to the internet or telephone service to contact \nhis creditors about payment plans. He filed his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007, \nwhich was dismissed in 2012, when he stopped making his plan payments. He stopped \nbecause he began to realize the impact bankruptcy would have on his security clearance. \nWhen he returned from his last deployment, he discovered that his debts were more than \n90 days past due. He recently employed a national law firm to attempt to have debts \nremoved from his credit reports. (Tr. 25-27, 31-33; GE 7-8) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$1,901.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties dating back to a 1998 Chapter \n13 bankruptcy where his debts were discharged, and a 2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy that \nwas dismissed for nonpayment in 2012. Additionally, he incurred 16 delinquent debts \ntotaling, approximately $31,000. Seven of the debts remain unpaid. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and credit reports establish the debts, and court records establish the \nbankruptcies. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he paid eight \nof the debts, with one also being cancelled by the creditor and reported as income to the \nIRS, he failed to address the remaining debts, which comprise approximately two-thirds \nof the overall debt amount. Additionally, the debts were not paid until after the issuance \nof Applicant\u2019s SOR in April 2021. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence that the debts arose from circumstances \nbeyond his control. He admitted using credit unwisely early in his Army career. \nAdditionally, he did not act responsibly concerning the debts when he failed to resolve \nthem in a timely fashion. He also failed to complete his second Chapter 13 payment plan. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented some evidence of financial counseling, which was the hiring \nof the law firm to clean up his credit. However, his track record to date does not support \na good financial picture. He has had financial difficulties for almost 25 years, beginning \nwhen he filed his first bankruptcy. Based upon his past history, there is no reason to \nbelieve that he will right his financial ship in the future. While he did resolve nine debts, \nthese actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g-1.k, 1.m, 1.o-1.p. \nWhile Applicant sent out numerous dispute letters, none contained specific \nreasons justifying any disputes. Additionally, no results from those inquiries were offered \ninto evidence. Applicant admitted all the debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployments, and his \ncontractor service. However, I also considered that he has not adequately addressed his \ndelinquent debt. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, \nwhich causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered the \nexceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated June \n8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.c,1.g-1.k, 1.m, 1.o-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.f, 1.l, 1.n, 1.q-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I incorporated these documents into the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and AE \nB. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old single man. He finished college in 2006, double majoring \nin finance and statistics, and in 2008, he earned a master\u2019s degree in operations research. \nHe has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2019, as a data \nengineer. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to the director of the government \nagency that Applicant serves, he is a man of character and integrity, and an impressive \nworker. (AE B) \nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, \nsince about 2014 to the present. (Tr. 28) In April 2014, he was arrested and charged with \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Answer at 1) When the police stopped him, he \nwas on the way home from a pub where he had consumed a few beers. (Tr. 38) The police \nofficer administered a sobriety test, and Applicant\u2019s blood/alcohol content registered .15 \npercent. (Tr. 41) Subsequently, Applicant was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail \nwith five months and 25 days suspended, ordered to pay a $2,500 fine, and ordered to \nattend alcohol education classes. (Tr. 43) Moreover, the court suspended his driver\u2019s \nlicense for a year. (Tr. 43) \nIn March 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI after an evening of \ndrinking alcohol and bar hopping. (Tr. 50-52) Subsequently, he was convicted and \nsentenced to ten days in jail and 29 days of house arrest, fined $2,600, and placed on \nprobation for 11 months and 29 days. (GE 8 at 6) Moreover, the court suspended his \nlicense was for five years, ordered him to complete in-patient treatment and 50 hours of \ncommunity service, and ordered him to install an ignition interlock device on his \nautomobile. (Tr. 43-45, 60, GE 8 at 6; GE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s inpatient treatment program, lasting from June 28, 2019 to July 8, 2019, \nconsisted of a combination of individual and group counseling. (Tr. 45: GE 6 at 1) During \nthe program, Applicant admitted to drinking to intoxication three days per week.

(GE 6 at 1; GE 7 at 9) He was diagnosed with \u201csevere alcohol dependency.\u201d \n(GE 6 at 5) \nApplicant successfully completed the treatment program, and was discharged after \n14 days. (GE 6 at 5) The clinician who worked with him during the treatment program \nrecommended that he work with a 12-step support program, such as Alcoholics \nAnonymous, and attend follow-up aftercare appointments. (GE 6 at 2, 5) Applicant\u2019s \ncounselor characterized his prognosis as fair to moderate \u201cprovided [he] adheres to the \nrecommendations of the treatment team and continues working a program of recovery and \nabstain from mood altering chemicals, including alcohol.\u201d (GE 6 at 2) \nApplicant remained abstinent from alcohol for approximately one month after \ndischarge from in-patient treatment in June 2019. (Tr. 75) He resumed drinking alcohol in \nAugust 2019, then stopped in approximately February 2020. (GE 2 at 11 Some time later, \nApplicant resumed alcohol consumption. He currently drinks two to three alcoholic drinks \nper week on weekends, and he is not enrolled in a 12-step support program. (Tr. 76) \nIn October 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While License \nRevoked with Knowledge, and Operating a Motor Vehicle without a Required Ignition \nInterlock Device. (Answer at 1) In February 2020, he pleaded guilty in state court, and was \nsentenced to 29 days of house arrest. (Tr. 80) In June 2020, Applicant was charged in \nfederal court for the same offense. (Tr. 80) \nApplicant characterizes his decision to drive on a suspended license as a \n\u201cdesperate decision\u201d after months of commuting 16 miles roundtrip to work by bicycle to a \nbase that did not consistently allow ride sharing or cab access. (Tr. 78) In addition, he \nadmits that he had not installed an ignition interlock device at the time of his arrest, \nexplaining that he considered this requirement redundant, having already been prohibited \ntotally from driving. (Tr. 77) \nIn January 2021, Applicant successfully applied to the state\u2019s motor vehicle \nadministration for a reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license on a restricted basis. (Answer at 2) \nUnder the reinstatement, he is allowed to commute to work, drive for educational purposes, \nand drive to church. (Answer at 2) The state motor vehicle authority\u2019s authorization for \nApplicant to drive under restricted conditions stated that he must obtain an ignition interlock \ndevice before the restrictions were relaxed. (Answer at 2) \nApplicant contends that he \u201cdoes not have an Alcohol Dependency problem\u201d \nbecause he has none of the associated risk factors. (AE A) He provided no evidence from \neither a physician, counselor, or certified alcohol clinician that his diagnosis is in remission. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder this concern, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI \nand alcohol-related arrests, and diagnosis of severe alcohol dependence triggers the \napplication of the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant continues to drink alcohol and he is not enrolled in a 12-step rehabilitation \nprogram, in contravention of the discharge recommendations of the clinician at the facility \nwhere he received inpatient treatment. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cthe failure \nto follow treatment advice once diagnosed,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is \nnot in accordance with treatment recommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder,\u201d also apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and  \n(d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAlthough Applicant attended an inpatient treatment program, he did not enroll in a \n12-step rehabilitation program, as recommended, after completing the program. He quit \ndrinking alcohol after completing an intensive inpatient treatment program, but relapsed a \nmonth after completing the program. He quit drinking a few months later, only to resume \nuse. Currently, he drinks alcohol, in contravention of the recommendations of his discharge \ncounselor. Applicant\u2019s contention that he is not alcohol dependent is unsupported by any \nrecord evidence. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions, set forth \nabove, applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of DUI convictions, together with his conviction for probation violations trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct . . . .\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited, to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nApplicant has a good employment record, as indicated by the strong \nrecommendation from the head of the government agency that he serves as a contractor.  \nThis constitutes evidence of successful rehabilitation, triggering the application of AG \u00b6 \n20(d). \nConversely, although Applicant completed in-patient treatment per the terms of his \nprobation, he did not comply with his discharge instructions, and, as of the time of the \narrest for probation violation in 2020, he had not installed an ignition interlock device on his \nvehicle. Although he has since successfully applied for an upgrade from a completely \nrestricted license to a partially restricted license, his driving privileges are still overseen by \nthe state because of his history of alcohol-related convictions.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-i. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He has been working full time as an apprentice for a federal contractor since September 2018. He experienced a brief period of unemployment in 2012, but otherwise has maintained continuous employment since 2011. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in 2014. He is not married and has no children. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 3 at 7, 16, 14, 23, and 23-26.)

The SOR alleges eight delinquent student loans. The August 2022 credit report, Item 4, documents the student loans. The February 2022 credit report, Item 5, documents a charged-off credit-card debt. His student loans total about $49,670. (Item 4 at 5-7.)

In 2018, he stated on his SCA that: \n\u201cI plan on letting the collection agencies (within a week) know that I will begin making \npayments on my loans. I will inform them on wanting to join the late payment forgiveness \nplan. Then, eventually setting up a consolidation plan.\u201d (Item 3 at 36.) \nThe evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: education loan placed for collection of $12,102.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admission and statement in his 2018 SCA along with the credit reports \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d, and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. He listed the delinquent student loans in his SCA and provided no evidence \nto support the plan he stated in his SCA. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment in 2012 was \nbrief and there is no other evidence of circumstances beyond his control. He did not \nprovide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve \nthem. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and unresolved. He did not \nestablish that his financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to recur. He has not \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). He has failed to establish that he has made a good-faith effort \nto pay or resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

She graduated from high \nschool in 1994, and she attended some college but did not earn a degree. She worked \nfor various DOD contractors since 2007, to include stints overseas from approximately \n2019 to 2022. She was first granted a security clearance in 2007. She had a period of \nunemployment from December 2018 to April 2019. As of the date of the hearing, she had \nworked for her current employer in state A since 2022. As of the date of the hearing, she \nwas renting in state A. She has owned a home in state B since August 2014. (Answer; \nTr. at 6, 8-9, 26-32, 59-60, 62; GE 1; AE J) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2012, and the \nbankruptcy was discharged in June 2012. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that she had eight \ndelinquent consumer debts totaling $35,353. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.i) The SOR allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, her SCA, four credit bureau reports \nfrom 2019 to 2022, and bankruptcy court records. (Answer; GE 1-7) \nApplicant attributed her financial difficulties, including her Chapter 7 bankruptcy, to \nbeginning in 2012, when her relationship with the father of her two younger children ended \nand he ceased contributing to expenses for which he was previously responsible. In \naddition, she was hospitalized for a severe illness in March 2012 and again in January \n2016. She incurred significant medical expenses for which her medical insurance only \ncovered approximately 50%. She received short-term disability, consisting of 60% of her \npay, from April to October 2017. Before her move to state A, she maintained her \nhousehold overseas and that of her children in state B. Her annual income decreased \nfrom $150,000 to $95,000 when her contract overseas ended. She prioritized her health \nand paid her medical expenses but was overwhelmed and elected to resolve her \ndelinquent debts through bankruptcy. (Answer; Tr. at 28, 30-36, 38-39, 44, 49-54, 65-68; \nGE 1, 2, 7; AE J) \nApplicant claimed $67,249 in liabilities in her 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) She received credit counseling as part of her bankruptcy. (Tr. at 33, 36, 62-63, 67-\n68; GE 1, 2, 5-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $630 charged-off credit card. Applicant resolved this debt in \nOctober 2020 with a payment of $531. The 2022 credit bureau reports reflect that this \ndebt was paid.

(Tr. at 27-32, 38-40, 42, 51, 54-67, 69-72; AE \nJ) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or.\n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also\nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. She paid SOR \u00b6 1.b in \n2020, and she reached out to the creditors for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g in 2021, before she \nreceived the SOR. She paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, and 1.i in October 2022. She has had \npayment plans in place since October 2022 to address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. She \nreceived credit counseling in 2012, through her Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and again in 2022. \nShe developed a budget, and her $943 monthly net remainder provides her with the \nmeans to continue to address her remaining debts. She does not have any other \ndelinquent debts. Her finances are under control, and they do not continue to cast doubt \non her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:   \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice \nof the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and \nwill not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note, Cuba is a one-party \nsystem in which the Communist Party is the only legal political party. Elections are neither \nfree, fair, or competitive. Since 1962 there has been an economic embargo on trade \nbetween the United States and Cuba. In 1982, Cuba was designated as a state sponsor \nof terrorism because of its long history of providing advice, safe haven, communications, \ntraining, and financial support for guerrilla groups and individual terrorists. The \ndesignation was rescinded in 2015 and reinstated in 2021 due to the continued presence \nof members of foreign terrorist organizations in Cuba. It maintains close and collaborative \nties with designated state sponsors of terror such as Iran and North Korea. It continues \nto harbor multiple fugitives who committed or supported acts of terror in the United States. \nThere are ongoing human rights problems, including detaining U.S. citizens who are \nsuspected of engaging in activities perceived to undermine state security, monitoring \ncitizens\u2019 internet and retaliation against them for their speech, along with blocking \ngovernment critics. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 3.a.

Her mother worked for a short time \nin the clothing business but has not been employed for a long time. Her mother does not \nhave any direct ties to the government of Cuba. Her mother visited her in the United \nStates in approximately 2007, and she visited her mother in Cuba in 2019. (Tr. 30-31, 58-\n59-62, 65-69, 110) \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother was born in Cuba and now lives in Germany.

(GE 13) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with battery in 2008. She testified she could \nnot recall the facts but believed she and a person she was in a relationship with at the \ntime were both arrested because they had a fight. In August 2015, she was arrested and \ncharged with felony burglary of an occupied dwelling and damage to property-criminal \nmischief over $200 and under $1,000. She broke a car side mirror when she was angry \nat her partner for cheating on her. She was required to pay restitution. In August 2016, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault-domestic violence, \nand two charges of battery-domestic violence. All of the charges for these incidents were \ndismissed/nolle prossed. Applicant admitted she was arrested and charged. She stated \nthat she was required to pay restitution for damage she did to her boyfriend\u2019s vehicle. All \nof these cases stem from arguments and disagreements with her ex-husband or ex-\nboyfriend. She testified that her boyfriend told the police lies and none of the incidents \nhappened the way he said they did. She is no longer with either of them, and she asserted \nthat she has not been involved in any criminal activity since 2016.

She explained in her SOR answer that she \nand her then husband and father to two of her children decided to divorce. She was not \nworking at the time, and he was paying the bills. When he left, she remained in the \napartment and looked for a job. She said she paid the delinquent rent in order to move \ninto a new apartment. No documents were provided. (Tr. 43; Answer to SOR; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c and 4.d are also court-issued judgments of eviction issued against \nApplicant for failure to pay rent in February 2017 ($1,100) and January 2014 ($1,100). \nShe denied in her SOR answer the February 2017 eviction judgment. Applicant testified \nthat she resolved both of these because she would have been unable to rent a new place \nor purchase a home if they were still due. She did not provide any documents. The \nevidence supports the eviction judgments. (Tr. 41-45; GE 9, 10) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleged that in 2018 while living in an apartment, Applicant allowed an \nunauthorized person, the father of her children, to live in her residence at different times, \nwhich was against the rules of her lease. She was accused of having loud and boisterous \ndiscussions outside of her apartment unit. Her landlord posted a written notice on her \napartment that said her lease was not being renewed, and she was to vacate the premises \nby August 10, 2018. She did not vacate on that date and her landlord filed an eviction \nnotice against her on August 15, 2018. (Tr. 53-54; GE 11) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding the allegation, she said that she and \nher partner argued but it was never outside of the apartment. She said she went to the \nrental office to renew her lease, and she was told she was not permitted to renew it. She \nsaid she did not know why. She was aware her lease expired, and she was required to \nleave before then. She said she was in the process of purchasing a house and was \nstaying in the apartment until the lease expired. She said she was unable to pay her rent \nbefore she moved out, but she was taking care of the debt. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that the father of her children was not listed on the lease as \nrequired. She said because she was in the process of purchasing a home, she was saving \nher money to put a down payment on the house and was not paying her rent. She decided \nto not pay the rent and instead use the money to fix her credit and make a down payment. \nShe figured the landlord could use her security deposit instead. She purchased the home \nin July 2019. She was issued an eviction notice in July 2019. She resolved the delinquent \npayments to the landlord in July 2022. At that time, she was in the process of selling her \nfirst home and purchasing a new one. She took out a loan of $12,000 to pay some debts \nto improve her credit so she would qualify to purchase a new home. She then sold her \nfirst house and used the profits to repay the loan. She then repaid the eviction debt that \nshe incurred in 2019. She provided a document to show that she resolved the 2019 \neviction debt (SOR \u00b6 4.b). The document she provided is from a debt collector. She \ntestified she did not pay the debt when it was owed because she did not have the money. \nShe testified that she took the loan to clear her negative credit history and resolve the \nfinancial issues that were raised by the government with regards to her public trust \nposition.

Applicant said the FSO told her that it was okay \nand \u201cit happens.\u201d (Tr. 94) She said she was not told to correct it. She said she is open \nabout having been arrested.

(Tr. 37-39, 81-84, 93-97) \nApplicant was asked why she told the government investigator that the reason she \nomitted her prior arrests was because she was concerned that her application would be \ndenied, and she would not get the job. She denied she made this statement to the \ninvestigator. She testified that if she did not answer the questions correctly it was because \nshe did not understand the questions and did not understand how important it was for the \njob. She testified that she needed the job and was just filling out the application as was \nrequired. When asked why she failed to disclose under Section 28 her civil court actions \nfor her evictions.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nCuba. Applicant\u2019s contact with her mother living in Cuba creates a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nand coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence and \napply to Applicant\u2019s mother. \nApplicant has minimal contact with her half-brother. He lives in Germany, has a \nPolish passport, and has a family and a job there as a train conductor. Applicant \ncommunicates with him about once a month through a cell phone application. There is no \nevidence that he has any relationship with the government of Cuba.

The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Cuba through her mother. Her contact \nis more than casual and infrequent as she speaks with her often and provides her financial \nsupport. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. Cuba falls into this category, which raises the risk \nimplications. \nApplicant\u2019s mother worked for a short time in the clothing business but has not \nworked for a long time. She does not have any direct ties to the government of Cuba, but \ndoes rely on the government benefits. Applicant visited her mother in Cuba in 2019 and \nher mother visited her in the United States in approximately 2007. \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States outweigh her ties to Cuba. She has lived in \nthe United States for 24 years and does not intend to ever move back there. She has four \nchildren she is raising in the United States. Although, she has contact with her mother, I \nfind her contacts in the United States outweigh the contact with her mother. I find it is \nunlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterest of her mother and that of the United States. I find there is no conflict of interest \nfor Applicant because of her deep ties through her children and that she would be \nexpected to resolve any issues in favor of the United States. The above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concerns for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was charged with battery in 2008. In 2015, she was arrested and \ncharged with felony burglary of an occupied dwelling and damage property-criminal \nmischief over $200 and under $1,000. In 2016, she was arrested and charged with felony \naggravated assault-domestic violence, and two charges of battery-domestic violence. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been eight years since Applicant\u2019s last arrest. All of her charges were \ndismissed or nolle prossed. It appears the charges related to relationships she was in at \nthe time, which is no longer the case. I find that so much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior occurred and it happened under unique circumstances that are unlikely \nto recur. Applicant has been steadily employed since 2018 and is providing for her \nchildren. The above mitigating conditions apply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had a delinquent debt from 2016 owed for a repossessed vehicle and \nseveral court-issued judgments for eviction for failure to pay her rent. In one instance, she \ntestified that she stopped paying her rent so she could save that money to put a down \npayment on a house she intended to purchase. She also explained that when her \nhusband moved out of their apartment she was not working and was unable to pay the \nrent. Applicant had her debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2008. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant resolved her 2016 debt on a repossessed vehicle after she became \naware in 2022 that her finances would impact her ability to obtain a public trust clearance. \nShe did the same regarding rent she owed when an eviction judgment was entered in \n2019 and she resolved it in 2022. This does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. An additional concern is that she chose not \nto pay her rent so she could use the money for a down payment on a house. Some of her \nfinancial problems were likely due to her husband or partner at the time failing to pay their \nshare of the debts. However, Applicant did not always act responsibly. I have given her \nsome credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). There is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent, and she has a \nsignificant history of receiving eviction judgments. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nDespite some minimal mitigating factors, it is insufficient to mitigate the concerns under \nthis guideline. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a\nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose on her SF 86 that she had been arrested \nin 2015 and 2016. She also deliberately failed to disclose her 2008, 2014 and 2018 \neviction judgments and bankruptcy. I did not find her explanations credible regarding \nthese matters. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleged that Applicant\u2019s boisterous discussions outside her apartment \nwith an unauthorized male who was not on her lease, which led to the landlord posting \nan eviction notice, as conduct falling within the personal conduct disqualifying conditions. \nI find there is insufficient evidence with these facts to rise to the level of a personal conduct \ndisqualifying condition. I find in her favor for this allegation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying trustworthiness concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberately failed to disclose on her SF 86 her criminal arrests and \nnon-criminal court actions. She was offered an opportunity when she was interviewed by \na government investigator to disclose the information and did not. She explained her \nfailure to do so was because she thought it would impact her application and job. She \nlater claimed she did not understand the question, which I found not credible. The public \ntrust application process relies on those seeking a public trust position to be honest and \nforthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B, E, F, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant met her burden of persuasion regarding Guidelines B, foreign influence \nand J, criminal conduct. She failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guidelines E, \npersonal conduct and F, financial considerations. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \nraised. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a-4.f \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. On my own motion without objection, I have also taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the U.S. State Department fact sheet titled \u201cU.S. \nRelations with India.\u201d2 The pertinent facts are summarized in the written request and the \nfact sheet and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that \nIndia is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works closely with the United States on many \nmatters, shares common strategic interests, and generally respects the rights of its \ncitizens. It also continues to have human rights problems; it has been victimized by \nterrorist attacks; and restricted dual-use technology has been illegally exported to India. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 41-year-old consultant for a defense contractor. She is applying for \na security clearance for the first time. She attended college in India and earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in 2007. She is married with two children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 14-16, 23; GE 1; AE L) \nApplicant was born in India to Indian parents. She married her husband in India \nin 2003. He was an Indian citizen living in the United States as a permanent resident at \nthe time. She came to the United States in 2003 after they married. She and her \nhusband became U.S. citizens in 2018. India does not permit dual citizenship, and they \nrenounced their Indian citizenships when they became U.S. citizens. Their children were \nborn in the United States. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 30; GE 1; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is deceased. Her brother lives in the United States as a \npermanent resident. Her father and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of India. \nHer father and father-in-law are retired. Her father is wealthy and has no need for \nsupport from Applicant. Applicant regularly communicates with her family and in-laws in \nIndia. She visited them usually about every other year, but she has not been to India \nsince 2019. Her in-laws visited Applicant and her husband in the United States for about \nsix months in 2020. (Tr. at 17-18, 23-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE I) \nApplicant received property from her family in India in about 2002. She estimated \nthe value of the property at $75,000. Her husband also owns property in India with an \nestimated value of $200,000. They are attempting to sell their properties in India. She \nhas a bank account in India with a balance of about $5,000.

Applicant and her \nimmediate family have lived in the same house for almost 16 years. It has an estimated \nvalue of $500,000, and they own it outright. Their assets in the United States total about \n$3 million. She is involved in her children\u2019s athletic pursuits. (Tr. at 16-17, 20, 29; AE G, \nJ, K) \nApplicant expressed her undivided allegiance to the United States and her love \nfor this country. She stated that this is \u201cthe land of opportunities.\u201d She credibly testified \nthat her family and assets in India could not be used to coerce or intimidate her into \nrevealing classified information. (Tr. at 22, 31) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to her excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. She is praised for her work ethic, \ntrustworthiness, dedication, and honesty. (AE D-F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern\nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign\ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign\ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s father and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of India. She and \nher husband own property in India. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works closely \nwith the United States on many matters, shares common strategic interests, and \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. It also continues to have human rights \nproblems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; and restricted dual-use technology \nhas been illegally exported to India. Applicant\u2019s foreign family and financial interests \ncreate a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both individually and through her \nhusband. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to India. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. Her husband and children are U.S. citizens and \nresidents. She and her husband gave up their Indian citizenships when they became \nU.S. citizens. They have been quite successful and have substantial assets in the \nUnited States. She expressed her undivided allegiance to the United States and her \nlove for this country. She credibly testified that her family and financial interests in India \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate her into revealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to India are outweighed by her deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely she will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof India. There is no conflict of interest, because she can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered her \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact below. Applicant is 42 years old. He married in 2011, and he has three children, ages 10, 8 and 5. He was born in Nigeria, and he immigrated to the United States in 2009, at the age of 28. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, and his wife recently became a naturalized U.S. citizen too. He does not consider himself to be a dual citizen of Nigeria and the U.S. because he renounced his Nigerian citizenship after he became a U.S. 2 citizen. He traveled to Nigeria one time in 2018. He has been employed by a federal contractor since April 2015 as a database administrator. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) Personal Conduct The SOR alleges that Applicant allowed multiple business entities and individuals to deposit over $500,000 into his U.S. bank account(s), between February 2015 and September 2016. He did this at the request of his nephew, a dual citizen of Nigeria and Norway (also referenced by Applicant as his \u201ccousin\u201d because they are about the same age.) His nephew requested that Applicant transfer over $500,000 from his bank accounts to his nephew and to persons unknown to Applicant, and to business entities in Nigeria. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.)

I received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 22, 2023, and the record closed March 30, 2023. \n Administrative Notice  \nI take administrative notice of facts concerning Nigeria. Those facts are set out in \nthe Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for the Federal Republic of Nigeria \n(HE 2). The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and \nmatters not subject to reasonable dispute. The pertinent facts are as follows: \nNigeria \nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and the Federal Capital \nTerritory. Nigeria faces many challenges fueled by sectarian, religious, and ethnic \nviolence. Numerous terrorist groups are increasingly active throughout Nigeria. Threats \nof kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that \nall travel to Nigeria should be avoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights \nrecord; the active and hostile presence of Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa; and other \ninsurgent and extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security \nand military forces, the local populace, and U.S. citizens and interests. \nNigeria is a global hub for cybercriminal activity. The U.S. has partnered with \nNigerian law enforcement to crack down on cybercrime. U.S. authorities have brought \ncharges against a number of Nigerian nationals for internet fraud and money laundering. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact below. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He married in 2011, and he has three children, ages 10, \n8 and 5. He was born in Nigeria, and he immigrated to the United States in 2009, at the \nage of 28. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, and his wife recently became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen too. He does not consider himself to be a dual citizen of Nigeria \nand the U.S. because he renounced his Nigerian citizenship after he became a U.S. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncitizen. He traveled to Nigeria one time in 2018. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since April 2015 as a database administrator. This is his first application for a \nDOD security clearance. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant allowed multiple business entities and individuals \nto deposit over $500,000 into his U.S. bank account(s), between February 2015 and \nSeptember 2016. He did this at the request of his nephew, a dual citizen of Nigeria and \nNorway (also referenced by Applicant as his \u201ccousin\u201d because they are about the same \nage.) His nephew requested that Applicant transfer over $500,000 from his bank accounts \nto his nephew and to persons unknown to Applicant, and to business entities in Nigeria. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant admitted this allegation. (SOR response; Tr. 20-29, 62-65; GE 2) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview in July 2019, he was confronted by an \nauthorized DOD investigator about his unusual financial activities. Applicant explained \nthat his nephew and his half-brother told Applicant the money deposited into his U.S. \nbank accounts was going to be used to build renovations to the palace in his Nigerian \nhometown. His nephew owned the construction company, and he would be managing the \nconstruction work on the palace. His nephew wanted to deposit money into Applicant\u2019s \nbank accounts and then transfer the money to Nigeria in order to get a better foreign \nexchange rate. Applicant gave his nephew his personal financial bank account numbers \nand routing numbers, which were then used by various unknown individuals and/or \nbusiness entities. When Applicant\u2019s bank accounts were closed by the U.S. banks due to \nthis disconcerting activity, Applicant questioned his nephew and asked him to be honest \nabout the money transfers. His nephew admitted that he had lied and there was never a \nplan to renovate the palace; the money transfers were all for the purpose of buying and \nselling money and exchanging foreign currency for profit. Applicant later learned that his \nnephew set up a Nigerian company, not for the purpose of construction, but for the \nbusiness of buying and selling foreign currency. (SOR response; TR. 20-38, 62-65; SOR \nresponse) \n\u2026my nephew sent the money to me because he\u2019s going to get a better rate, \ntransfer rate. You know, the exchange rate just in dollar. If you get dollar in \nNigeria, you get a better exchange rate compared to when you send a Great \nBritain pound to Nigeria. So, the better rate, the dollars. That was the reason \nwhy he transferred it through me to send to Nigeria, I thought at that time. \n(Tr. 29) \nApplicant admitted during cross examination that he does not have a license as a \nforeign currency trader. He did not make any profit or charge an exchange fee for allowing \nhis nephew and others to use his U.S. bank accounts. Some of the individuals who \ndeposited money into his bank accounts were from multiple states in the U.S. He \ndiscovered that his nephew was buying the dollars from a third party who knew the \ndepositors. Applicant never considered that his nephew was engaged in any form of \ncriminal activity or money laundering. In about September 2016, Applicant and his \nnephew had to respond to inquiries by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(EFCC) during the investigation of these financial transactions. This Nigerian commission \nis charged with the responsibility of investigation and enforcement of all economic and \nfinancial crimes laws in Nigeria. Applicant has not received any additional communication \nfrom the EFCC. He had completely forgotten about this information during his first \nbackground interview. (Tr. 29-38, 64; SOR response; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that on January 26, 2018, Applicant allowed an unknown person \nto deposit a total of $10,000 in two separate transactions into his bank account the same \nday. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted he had transferred this money at the \nrequest of his nephew into his nephew\u2019s foreign entity created for the sole purpose of \nexchanging currency for profit. At the hearing, Applicant stated that his mother had \npassed away in 2009. In 2018, he and his family decided to create a memorial for his \nmother. Applicant had the money deposited into his bank account from unknown sources, \nand then he transferred the money to pay for his mother\u2019s memorial. Applicant did not \nprovide corroborating documentation to support his later inconsistent statement. (Tr. 38-\n41; SOR Response; GE 2) \nForeign Influence \nUnder Guideline B, SOR \u00b6 2.a repeated the allegation as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nbut this allegation also alleged that in February 2018, Applicant loaned his nephew \napproximately $1,551. Applicant previously addressed the first part of this allegation, cited \nabove. \nApplicant testified that after discovering his nephew had lied to him about raising \nmoney to renovate the palace and ultimately using his bank accounts for making a profit \non the currency exchange rate, Applicant received a request from his nephew to loan him \nsome money by transferring $1,500 into his nephew\u2019s ex-spouse\u2019s bank account. She \nwas a resident of the U.S. Applicant did this because his nephew did not have money at \nthe time, and his nephew\u2019s ex-spouse needed money to care for a sick child. (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \n(Tr. 41-44; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege that in 2016 Applicant transferred (an unspecified \namount of) money to one business entity, and he transferred $74,000 to another business \nentity, both located in Nigeria. Applicant testified that one of these entities is a gas station \nowned by his nephew. I assumed the other entity is the false construction entity his \nnephew used for the exchange of foreign currency. SOR \u00b6 2.e alleged that Applicant \nmaintains a bank account in Nigeria. At the hearing Applicant estimated that he had a \ntotal of $75 in this bank account. He disclosed this information on his security clearance \napplication (SCA). (Tr. 44-45; GE 2; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleges that Applicant has three sisters, two brothers, and a stepbrother \nwho are citizens and residents of Nigeria. SOR \u00b6 2.h alleges that Applicant has a \nstepbrother who resides elsewhere. Applicant admitted the information at the hearing, \nand he also stated that he has a total of six half-brothers. His father had three wives, so \nbasically, they are his half-brothers instead of stepbrothers, as alleged in the SOR and \nlikewise listed on his SCA.

One sister works as a mid-\nwife, and he was not certain if his other two sisters were employed. One brother sells food \nprovisions, another brother is a farmer, and his oldest half-brother is a professor at a \nuniversity in South Africa. He has occasionally sent money to these family members at \ntheir request. The last time he provided money occurred in February 2022 when he sent \n$125 to help pay for a family member\u2019s hospital bill. None of his family members are \nassociated with the Nigerian military or government. (Tr. 47-59, 64-66; GE 1, GE 2; SOR \nresponse) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges Applicant has two friends who are citizens and residents of \nNigeria. He testified that he occasionally receives texts from these friends, but not on a \nregular basis. They both sent their condolences to Applicant after his father passed away \nin December 2022. He does not believe his friends are associated with the Nigerian \nmilitary or government. (Tr. 54-59; GE 2; SOR response) \nForeign Preference \nThe SOR also alleges Guideline C security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s banking \ntransactions, as set forth in subparagraph 1.a, above, were conducted to finance the \nrenovation of a palace in his hometown in Nigeria. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse he admitted this information but denied he had personally contributed any \nmoney for the renovation of the palace. (SOR response) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \u2026 \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant provided his personal bank information to his nephew and allowed \nunknown individuals and entities to deposit more than $500,000 into his U.S. bank \naccounts. He then transferred the money to his nephew and unknown individuals and \nentities from February 2015 until January 2018, as supported by the record evidence and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s involvement in funneling more \nthan $500,000 through his U.S. bank accounts and into another country for a year-and-\na-half is troubling. He did not question these transactions and allowed this practice to \ncontinue until the U.S. banks closed his bank accounts in about September 2016. He then \nquestioned his nephew and discovered he had been manipulated and deceived. They \nboth had to respond to investigative inquiries from the EFCC. In January 2018, Applicant \nhad two unknown individuals transfer $10,000 into his bank account, and Applicant \ntransferred $10,000 to his nephew\u2019s foreign business entity that was created for the sole \npurpose of exchanging foreign currency for profit. At the hearing, Applicant provided an \ninconsistent and unsupported statement that the money was transferred to Nigeria to \ncreate a memorial to honor his mother on the 10th anniversary of her death. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest.

May 19, \n2004). \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nTo establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Nigeria. Given the \nactivities of the Nigerian government and significant human rights violations, terrorist \nactivities, cybercrime, and money laundering, I find the Government has established the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrequisite \u201cheightened risk\u201d and potential conflict of interest regarding Applicant\u2019s contacts \nwith his family members in Nigeria.

ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002).   \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Nigeria. Although he claims to have infrequent contact with his family \nmembers after his father\u2019s passing, this does not mean he has completely severed ties \nwith his family members. He provided money a year ago to help pay for a family member\u2019s \nhospital bill. Applicant\u2019s financial support and contacts with relatives in Nigeria are \nmanifestations of his care and concern for relatives living in that country. \nApplicant\u2019s care and concern for relatives also includes his nephew, who \nmanipulated Applicant into funneling more than half of a million dollars into his personal \nU.S. bank accounts. Applicant subsequently transferred this money to his nephew, his \nnephew\u2019s false construction company in Nigeria, and to other individuals and entities \nunknown to Applicant. In this instance, Applicant was manipulated, and he was inclined \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto help a foreign person, group, or organization, in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. \ninterests or otherwise made him vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest. \nApplicant testified that he was aware of Nigeria\u2019s reputation for cybercrime activities and \nmoney laundering schemes, and in 2016, he was investigated for such crimes by the \nEFCC. In 2018, Applicant once again received deposits into his U.S. bank account from \nunknown persons and he transferred the $10,000 to his nephew\u2019s company in Nigeria. \nHe provided conflicting information about the reason for the exchange of $10,000. Based \non these actions, I find that when it comes to members of his family, Applicant cannot be \nexpected to resolve a conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant\u2019s \nconnection with his nephew and his past financial activities demonstrates a potential \nconflict of interest that continues to raise significant foreign influence security concerns. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(f) do not apply. \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant believed the banking transactions were conducted \nto finance renovations of a palace in Nigeria, which he supported and was therefore a \nsecurity concern. Applicant denied personally providing any money for this renovation \nproject. Foreign Preference becomes a security concern when an individual acts in such \na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States. In this instance, I do not find Applicant\u2019s support of a \nrenovation project for a palace in his hometown demonstrates a preference for Nigeria \nover the United States, or that his support of the renovation, even though it was later \ndiscovered to be a false project, conflicted with the national interests of the United States. \nApplicant has successfully refuted the foreign preference security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines \nE, B and C and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant denied any involvement in money laundering when he provided his \npersonal financial information to his nephew and other unknown sources. He had over \n$500,000 deposited into these accounts, and he transferred the money to his nephew, \nother individuals, and foreign entities for a year-and-a-half. He denied receiving any \nmoney for conducting these banking transactions. Common sense dictates that Applicant \neither knew, or should have known, that this type of activity and the significant amount of \nmoney funneled into his bank accounts should have raised some serious concerns. He \nwas aware of Nigeria\u2019s notoriety for cybercrimes and money laundering, and he was \ncontacted by the EFCC concerning his financial activities. There is insufficient evidence \nin the record to mitigate Applicant\u2019s continued involvement with the transfer of $10,000 \nfrom his bank account to his nephew\u2019s foreign business in 2018. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Although Applicant successfully refuted\nforeign preference security concerns, I conclude personal conduct and foreign influence\nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e, and 2.g-2.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraph 2.f.: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 3, Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.(might try closing up next paragraph to here to fit the page break at end) \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the p\n \nerson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable to the SOR allegations and \u00b6 20(d) is partially \napplicable as it pertains to delinquent debts alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.i \nthrough 1.l. His 2013 divorce no doubt played a role in Applicant\u2019s ability to remain \ncurrent on his established obligations at that time. However, Applicant does not receive \nfull credit under either of these two mitigating conditions because of his failure to act \nresponsibly under the circumstances and the time elapsed before addressing the debts \nthat he eventually did take action on. AG \u00b6 20(g) is not applicable because Applicant did \nnot provide documentation that he is in compliance with his state tax authority payment \nagreement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable. \nOf greater concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and \nstate income tax returns from 2012 to 2018. Applicant was alerted to the fact that his \nfailure to file these returns was a concern to the Government during his February 2019 \nOPM PSI, when he submitted his December 2020 DOHA Interrogatories, and later \nwhen he received his February 2021 SOR. These events apparently did not prompt \nApplicant to recognize the seriousness of his situation and take immediate corrective \naction. As of his hearing date, he had not filed Federal and state income tax returns \nsince 2012, and only set up a payment plan to pay his state tax lien on the day of his \nhearing. \nFailure to file his Federal and state income tax returns shows a significant lapse \nin judgment that cannot be overlooked, especially from an individual whose Federal \nincome is derived from tax dollars. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did not \nact responsibly with regard to timely filing his Federal and state income tax returns and \npaying or making payment arrangements in a timely manner for state taxes owed until \nthe day of his hearing. \nIn regard to the failure to timely file Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the c\n \nonduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 37-year-old logistics manager, who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since September 2018. He honorably served nine years as an \nactive-duty Marine and later worked as a civilian employee in support of the defense \nindustry. He has successfully held a clearance while in the Marine Corps and during his \nemployment as a defense contractor. He seeks to retain his security clearance as a \nrequirement of his continued employment. Applicant is in a relationship with a \ncohabitant and is responsible for supporting five children. He has all the indicators of an \nindividual with significant potential. \nHowever, for at least nine years, he has failed to grasp the importance of one of \nthe fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is the timely filing of his Federal \nand state income tax returns and paying taxes when due. This is especially crucial for \nan individual seeking to retain a security clearance and working for a defense contractor \nadvancing the national security of the United States. From the evidence presented, \ndespite being made aware that the timely filing of his Federal and state income tax \nreturns was a security concern, Applicant failed to comply with this basic and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfundamental civic obligation.

With more \neffort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(Tr. 47) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to 2012. He incurred \neight delinquent debts totaling approximately $42,000. The three largest debts remain \nunpaid. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the debts. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he paid five \nof the debts, he failed to address the remaining debts, which comprise the greatest portion \nof the overall debt amount. Additionally, the debts were not paid until after the issuance \nof Applicant\u2019s SOR in July 2021. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment after he was \ndischarged from the Navy were circumstances beyond his control, he also admitted using \ncredit unwisely early in his Navy career. He did not act responsibly concerning the debts \nwhen he failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. While he contacted the credit union to \narrange payment plans for two large debts, he failed to follow-up that action by making \nany payments. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented some evidence of financial counseling, which was the hiring \nof a company to clean up his credit. However, his track record to date does not support a \ngood financial picture. He has had financial difficulties for a number of years. Based upon \nhis past history, there is no reason to believe that he will right his financial ship in the \nfuture. While he did resolve five debts, these actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies \nonly to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployment, his contractor \nservice, and his periods of unemployment and underemployment. However, I also \nconsidered that he has not adequately addressed his delinquent debt. He has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to question \nhis ability to resolve his debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered the \nexceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated June \n8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b, 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c-1.g:: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. 6-8, 19-23, 35-37, 40, 42; GE 1-3; AE G-H) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used and purchased marijuana, \nwith varying frequency, from approximately 1995 to February 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) It \nalso alleged that he used marijuana, in approximately May 2003, while granted access to \nclassified information, and in approximately May 2013 and February 2015, while holding \na public trust position. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that he \nfalsified his 2002 security clearance application (SCA), by failing to disclose his prior drug \ninvolvement. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) It also alleged that he falsified his responses to section 23 of \nhis July 2018 SCA, by failing to disclose his use and purchase of marijuana, and by failing \nto disclose his 2003 marijuana use while granted access to classified information, as set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, respectively. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.d) \nApplicant experimented with marijuana in high school; he used it approximately \nfour times with friends. He used marijuana 10 times while in junior college, with friends or \non his own. He significantly increased his marijuana use to almost daily upon joining a \nfraternity while attending university. He used marijuana with friends at parties and on his \nown. He and members of his fraternity also purchased marijuana from a fraternity \nmember\u2019s friend, then sold the marijuana to their college friends. Sheriff\u2019s officers visited \nhim while in college and confiscated \u201cbetween a half and three-quarters of a bag\u201d of \nmarijuana from his dorm room. He cooperated with the officers and they did not arrest \nhim. He left the fraternity, disassociated himself from his fraternity friends, and stopped \nselling marijuana in 1999.

Although the 2002 SCA is not in \nevidence, he recalled completing it. He recalled the questions contained therein \npertaining to drug involvement. He admitted to omitting his drug history. He had just \ngraduated from college. He was 24 years old. He did not take the security clearance \nprocess seriously. His past drug use embarrassed him. He did not want to jeopardize his \nability to obtain a security clearance by disclosing his drug history. (Tr. at 28-29, 40-41, \n64; GE 4) \nApplicant used marijuana again in May 2003. He was celebrating with friends on \nthe eve of his wedding, and he smoked from a marijuana joint that his friends shared. He \nknew that he held a security clearance. He attributed this drug use to immaturity. (Tr. at \n27-28, 41, 53-55, 68-69; GE 2-4) \nIn March 2007, Applicant completed a questionnaire for non-sensitive positions \n(SF85) to obtain eligibility for a public trust position. As of the date of the hearing, this was \nthe only SF85 that he completed. Section 14 of that SF85 inquired only whether Applicant \nhad used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs within the past year. Since \nhe had not used illegal drugs in 2006, he truthfully answered that question. No one \ninformed him that he had access to sensitive information after he completed the SF85. \nHe did not believe he worked with sensitive information. He did not receive annual security \ntraining. He was unaware that he still had such access in 2013 and 2015. When he \ncompleted another SCA in June 2018, as further discussed below, he did so through the \nsame website he used to complete his SF85. When he saw his completed SF85, he \nrealized that he was likely granted access to sensitive information in 2007, and he \nestimated that he had such access for a period of between 10 to 15 years. (Tr. at 27-28, \n42-44, 55-59, 65; GE 1-2, 4) \nApplicant used marijuana again in May 2013 and February 2015, while he had \naccess to sensitive information. In May 2013, he used marijuana on the eve of a friend\u2019s \nwedding, shared by friends of the wedding party. He used marijuana last in February \n2015, while on vacation in Jamaica with his spouse. He smoked from a marijuana joint \nthat beach-goers shared. He also purchased and smoked a marijuana joint, and he \npurchased and ate a marijuana brownie. As discussed above, he was unaware that he \nhad access to sensitive information in 2013 and 2015.

Section 23 of that SCA inquired \nabout his illegal drug use and illegal drug purchase within the last seven years, as well \nas any illegal drug use or drug activity while holding a security clearance. He knowingly \nfalsified his responses when he marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his relevant use and \npurchase of marijuana, as well as his 2003 use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance. He anguished over it for several weeks. He discussed it with his spouse. He \nsought advice from an attorney, who encouraged him to correct his falsifications. He \ndecided that he did not want to repeat his falsifications every time he was re-investigated, \nand he was motivated to live by the advice he gives to his children to \u201cbe a man of their \nword and not lie.\u201d (Tr. at 29-37, 45-51, 59-64, 73-85; GE 2, 4) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn August 2018, Applicant notified his corporate facility security officer (FSO) that \nhe omitted information on his 2018 SCA.

This witness met Applicant in 2007, when Applicant was hired \nas a contractor for the agency in which the witness worked. When the witness served as \na branch chief in 2012, he oversaw Applicant\u2019s work assignments until 2018. He \ndescribed Applicant as an outstanding colleague with exemplary work ethic and \nperformance. A neighbor, close friend, fellow youth sports coach, and a lieutenant colonel \nin the U.S. Air Force Reserve who also provided a letter of support, described Applicant \nas a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct his mistakes. (Tr. at 76-165; GE \n4; AE F, I) \nApplicant also provided letters of support from four individuals who attested, in \n2018, to his trustworthiness, integrity, reliability, and judgment. One individual, who \nserved as the chief operating officer for a defense contractor and who hired Applicant in \n2014, attested to Applicant\u2019s exemplary performance.

Two neighbors, \none of whom was a fellow youth sports coach and the other, a family friend for more than \n30 years, described Applicant as a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct \nhis mistakes. Performance evaluations from 2018 to 2021 reflect that Applicant\u2019s \nemployer rated him favorably, noting that he is a strong performer who has demonstrated \nhigh levels of leadership. He is an active member of his community. (GE 4; AE A-F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana from approximately 1995 to 2015. He \nused marijuana in 2003 while granted access to classified information. He also used \nmarijuana in 2013 and 2015, while holding access to sensitive information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n25(c), and 25(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are established. Applicant testified \nthat he had no intention to use or purchase illegal drugs in the future. He no longer \nsocializes with individuals who are involved with illegal drugs. If he were to find himself in \nan environment where drugs are present, he stated that he would remove himself from \nthe situation. The record evidence resolves doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. I found Applicant to be candid and credible at the hearing. \nHe has taken responsibility for his past drug involvement. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability \nwhen he chose not to list his illegal drug involvement on his 2002 and 2018 SCA\u2019s, to \ninclude his illegal drug use in 2003 while possessing a clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(e)(1) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant was young and immature when he first applied for a security clearance \nin 2002. He acknowledged that he failed to take the security clearance process seriously \nwhen he completed his 2002 SCA and failed to disclose his past drug involvement. He \nself-reported his falsification on his July 2018 SCA, as well as the underlying information \nabout his past drug involvement, to his FSO and managers in August 2018. He also \ndisclosed this information to his spouse, friends, and colleagues. He made such \ndisclosures because he sought to take responsibility for his falsifications and his past drug \ninvolvement. He then disclosed his past drug involvement on his March 2019 SCA. He \nwas remorseful and understood the severity of failing to properly disclose his drug use on \nhis previous SCAs. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 AG 17(a), 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his \nhearing and found that he was credible, candid, and remorseful. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns involving \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains two allegations pertaining to delinquent federal and state taxes. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant denied both allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that he did not file federal tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. He admitted this allegation. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege delinquent credit-card accounts. Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, but denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, indicating that the account was settled. Applicant is 47 years old and single. He was married from 1996 to April 2008, when he divorced. He has no children. He has owned his residence since 2015. He took college courses at several academic locations between 2000 and 2017, but received no degree. He recently received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a local university and is five credits short of attaining a master\u2019s degree in business administration. (GE 1 at 9-16, 24, 32-40, 44; Tr. 7-8, 36, 38) Applicant has been working for a defense contractor at his current deputy-lead position since June 2021 and earns about $130,000 annually ($120,000 salary plus a $10,000 military pension). In his previous job from 2020 to June 2021, in a similar task- lead position, he also earned about $130,000 a year. From June 2015 to 2020, Applicant earned about $80,000, then $90,000 a year, as a task lead. Apparently, his temporary move to another state in 2020 or 2021 to reduce his chances of catching the COVID virus did not interrupt his consistent employment since 2015.

On September 5, 2019, he provided a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue a security \nclearance and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated September 10, \n2021, detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F).

The hearing was held by \nTeams video teleconference as scheduled. I entered the Government\u2019s six exhibits (GE) \n1-6 and Applicant\u2019s four exhibits (AE) A-D into evidence without objection. The exhibit \noriginally marked and admitted into evidence as AE C at the hearing was divided into \ntwo exhibits: federal tax year 2018 (AE C); and federal tax year 2019 (AE D). \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibit (AE E), unopposed by Department Counsel, was \nentered into evidence on February 10, 2023. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nFebruary 3, 2023. The record closed on February 10, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains two allegations pertaining to delinquent federal and state \ntaxes. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant denied both allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that \nhe did not file federal tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2019. He admitted this \nallegation. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege delinquent credit-card accounts. Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, but denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, indicating that the account was settled. \nApplicant is 47 years old and single. He was married from 1996 to April 2008, \nwhen he divorced. He has no children. He has owned his residence since 2015. He took \ncollege courses at several academic locations between 2000 and 2017, but received no \ndegree. He recently received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a local university and is five \ncredits short of attaining a master\u2019s degree in business administration. (GE 1 at 9-16, \n24, 32-40, 44; Tr. 7-8, 36, 38) \nApplicant has been working for a defense contractor at his current deputy-lead \nposition since June 2021 and earns about $130,000 annually ($120,000 salary plus a \n$10,000 military pension). In his previous job from 2020 to June 2021, in a similar task-\nlead position, he also earned about $130,000 a year. From June 2015 to 2020, \nApplicant earned about $80,000, then $90,000 a year, as a task lead. Apparently, his \ntemporary move to another state in 2020 or 2021 to reduce his chances of catching the \nCOVID virus did not interrupt his consistent employment since 2015. Applicant was \nhonorably discharged from the United States Navy (USN) in March 2015, after 20 years \nof service. He has held a security clearance since 1995. (GE 1 at 21; Tr. 8-11, 41-43) \nApplicant was asked several times to explain the reasons for his financial \nproblems. In his September 2019 PSI, he initially claimed that he forgot to file his 2018 \nfederal and state tax returns. Then he claimed he was waiting on his mortgage \ncompany to provide a document so that he could file the returns. He informed the OPM \ninvestigator that he intended to file the missing returns in September 2019. That did not \nhappen. He admitted procrastination for not filing his tax returns. He also told the \ninvestigator that he owed $6,000 in federal taxes for 2016, but he predicted that the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) would keep his 2018 refund to pay 2016 delinquent \ntaxes. He claimed the refund he received for federal tax year 2019 will be applied to his \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n2015 tax bill. Documented information related to his 2019 federal tax return appears in \nAE D. (GE 2 at 9-11; Tr. 50-51; AE D) \nApplicant began paying on the 2015 federal tax debt in 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nWhen asked why he waited five years to establish a repayment plan, he replied that he \ndid not have an answer. There was no reason why he could not have initiated the plan \nsooner. Applicant\u2019s federal tax payment-plan documentation indicates that his last $300 \npayment was received by the IRS on January 1, 2023. The remaining balance was \n$1,014, with the next payment due on February 1, 2023. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr. 45-48; AE D) \nFor the delinquent state taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.b), which have been delinquent since \ntax year 2015, Applicant made two payments totaling $5,926, on January 24, 2023. He \nhas no remaining tax liability with the state. He provided the same reason for the delay \nin not paying his state taxes as he expressed for the delinquent federal taxes. He \nconceded that when he moved into his house in December 2015, he did not understand \nthat his mortgage payments would fluctuate because no one fully explained the \ndisadvantages of his mortgage. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr. 45-48; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013Applicant provided answers to interrogatories indicating that he \nfiled his 2018 and 2019 federal tax returns on December 8, 2020. The account \ntranscript for tax year 2018 indicates that the 2018 return was filed on March 21, 2022. \nApplicant provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the dates in his answers \nto interrogatories (GE 2 at 6-7) or testimony and the 2018 account transcript. (AE C) \nThe tax account transcript for tax year 2019 (AE D) shows that no tax return \nwas filed. Instead, Applicant submitted a 2019 Form W-2 wage and tax statement, a \nForm 1098 mortgage interest statement, a Form 1098-T information, and a Form 1098-\nR Distributions from pensions. A portion of a federal tax return for tax year 2019, time-\nstamped February 8, 2023, was included in Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission. (AE E)  \nRegarding the SOR \u00b6 1.d credit-card account, Applicant used the credit card to \npurchase furniture. He stopped making payments on the account in January 2017, as \nhe could no longer afford the payments. The creditor extended a settlement offer of \n$8,900, which Applicant was unable to accept because he did not have the money. His \nlast contact with the creditor was in 2022. (GE 2 at 9-10; GE 2 at 4; GE 6 at 5; Tr. 52-\n53) The account is still unresolved.  \nApplicant stopped paying on the SOR \u00b6 1.e account in January 2017 for the \nsame reason he gave for not paying the SOR \u00b6 1.d account. He stated that he was \nusing his credit cards too much and was living beyond his means. He indicated that he \nsettled the account in 2021 for $4,000. Applicant\u2019s documentation reflects that the \naccount was \u201csettled in full,\u201d though no payment date is posted in the exhibit.

He disclosed the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e accounts as \nbeing in a delinquent status. He explained that he was receiving advice from an attorney \nabout his financial problems. Applicant stated that he and the attorney were debating \nwhether to file a Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. No action was taken as of \nthe date of e-QIP. It is difficult to correlate the discussions that Applicant had with the \nattorney concerning bankruptcy to fundamental elements of financial counseling. (GE 1 \nat 45-50) \nIn 2015 and 2016, Applicant took two one-to-five-day trips to Central America. \n(GE 1 at 37-40; Tr. 59) In May 2022, Applicant took a seven-day trip to Europe for \nvacation. The excursion cost a total of $1,100, including air fare. Applicant\u2019s current \ndiscretionary monthly remainder after payment of his expenses is between $2,300 and \n$2,500. (Tr. 60-61) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts, and filing and \npaying his taxes, are private matters until evidence reveals that he is not fulfilling these \nobligations in a timely fashion. Timing is also a critical issue when an applicant does not \nbegin to resolve his financial problems until after he has been notified that his security \nclearance is in jeopardy. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. September 26, 2019); \nISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018) \nBoth aspects of the timing issue are present in the circumstances of this case. \nApplicant knowingly became delinquent on his federal and state taxes in 2015. He \nwaited five years before addressing his federal taxes and about eight years before \nhandling his state taxes. The fact that he did not pay his state taxes until two days \nbefore security clearance hearing indicates that he may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to continually follow the rules, even when his personal interests (desire for a \nsecurity clearance) are not threatened. He did not file his 2018 and 2019 federal tax \nreturns on time. Though he settled one credit-card account for $4,000 in 2021, he has \nnot resolved the other delinquent credit-card account amounting to $18,962. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes about $18,962 in \ndelinquent debt to the SOR \u00b6 1.d creditor. With no discernible changes in his financial \npractices, especially with his discretionary monthly remainder of between $2,300 and \n$2,500, the debt will probably persist in the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to take charge of \nhis delinquent debt continues to raise doubts about his reliability and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems and credit-card delinquencies resulted from matters \nwithin his control. His purchase of the house in December 2015, even though he was \nunfamiliar with the mortgage rate fluctuations, exemplifies poor judgment. Applicant told \nthe OPM investigator that he was using his credit cards too much and that he was living \nbeyond his means. With no periods of unemployment or medical problems that would \nprevent him from working, no mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe lack of documented financial counseling or evidence of a written budget \nnegates the applicability of the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are not fully resolved or under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a because Applicant finally initiated a payment \nplan with the IRS in 2020, and has substantially reduced his IRS tax debt. He receives \nsome mitigation under SOR \u00b6 1.b, even though his payoff of the state tax debt was \nmotivated by his desire to protect his security clearance. Applicant receives full \nmitigation under the condition for his favorable action in settling the SOR \u00b6 19(e) debt in \n2021. AG \u00b6 20(g) fully applies to Applicant\u2019s substantial monthly compliance with the \nIRS payment plan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) that was launched in 2020. He receives only limited \nmitigation funder AG \u00b6 20(g) for his satisfying his delinquent state taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nbecause he waited eight years to address the debt, and his corrective action did not \noccur until after he received the SOR and two days before the security clearance \nhearing. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has enjoyed uninterrupted employment since 2015. He served his \ncountry in the USN from 1995 to his honorable discharge in 2015. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that to \nestablish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed \nin the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and \nhas taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has taken \ndocumented action with regard to his taxes. He has paid off one credit-card debt. \nHowever, he has to address a much larger delinquent debt. I do not regard Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy discussions as actual financial counseling, particularly when there is no \nfollow-up evidence that any action was taken. One successful method to avoid charging \ntoo much on credit cards so that an applicant can live within his means is to utilize a \nbudget that helps him monitor and manage his earnings and expenses. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c, 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. 2 Applicant is 77 years old. He has been married twice and has a longtime cohabitant. After college, he served as a U.S. Naval officer from 1969-71, with a security clearance. He later earned a master\u2019s degree. He has also had a clearance since 2004, through various federal contractor jobs. Applicant lived overseas from June 2015 to December 2017, working for State Department contractors. He submitted his SCA in April 2018, for a job in the U.S. with a defense contractor, a job with an $89,000 annual salary. (GE 1 at 15; Tr. 41-42, 46-48) Shortly before his hearing, he accepted a new position with another defense contractor, one that would require him to move across the country, which he did shortly after his hearing.

On \nMarch 16, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The CAF took the action \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

In an e-mail dated October 27, 2021, he indicated that \nhe had changed his mind, and was requesting a hearing. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A). \nThe DOHA Hearing Office received the case on November 3, 2021, and I was assigned \nas the administrative judge on May 20, 2022. \nAfter clarifying the status of Applicant\u2019s sponsorship for a clearance as well as his \ntravel schedule, DOHA issued the hearing notice on September 20, 2022 for an in-\nperson hearing on September 27, 2022. Applicant requested an expedited in-person \nhearing because he was moving for a new job days later and was uncertain about his \ntechnical availability for a video-teleconference hearing once he moved. (Tr. 7, 10-11) \nApplicant\u2019s in-person hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel \noffered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and GE 2. Applicant testified and offered AE A \nthrough AE I. All of the exhibits were admitted without objection. After the hearing, I \ninitially held the record open until October 31, 2022, to provide Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional information. Before that date, Applicant submitted two letters from \nreferences. They were marked as AE J and AE K and admitted without objection. \nApplicant did not submit further documents by the deadline, and the record closed. \nHowever, on December 10, 2022, Applicant submitted additional documents for \nconsideration. These exhibits, regarding five years of his state income taxes (2017-\n2021), are marked as AE L through AE P, and admitted without objection. The record \nclosed on December 16, 2022. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October \n5, 2022. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring the hearing, it became apparent that the first sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.a \ncontained a typographical error, noted in bold below: \n1.a: You failed to file, as required, Federal income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2017 through and 2019. \nThe error was cured through an amendment to the SOR deleting the word \u201cand.\u201d The \namendment was accepted without objection.

Applicant\u2019s tax issues began in 2017 when he \nwas working for a State Department contractor at a U.S. Embassy overseas. He \ntypically utilized a well-known tax preparation software program to prepare his taxes. \nThe program developed technical difficulties he was not able to cure at the time and he \nwas not able to complete or file his 2016 tax returns.

(GE \n2 at 7; Tr. 35-36, 41-43) He had not had tax filing issues before then. (Tr. 71) \nApplicant did not declare any tax issues on his April 2018 SCA, (which he filed \ndays before the April 15, 2018 federal tax filing deadline for tax year 2017). However, he \ndisclosed his unfiled returns in his October 2018 background interview. He also noted \nthat his recuperation from an operation also impacted the filing of his 2017 taxes in \n2018. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 35-36, 41-43) \nApplicant authenticated his background interview with a government investigator \n(with some edits and margin notes) in February 2021. At that time, he also reported that \nhis 2017 taxes had been filed, but not 2018 or 2019. He provided no supporting \ndocumentation, as requested. (GE 2) Applicant recalled speaking with the investigator \nduring his background interview about his tax returns, and recalled speaking with a \nDepartment Counsel about them as well, about a year before his hearing. (Tr. 58-61) \nApplicant testified that his tax issues were not due to deliberate action, and he \ndid not intend to defraud the government. He knew his tax issues were \u201changing over \n[his] head.

They worked on a classified State \nDepartment project together. Applicant fulfilled his duties in an exemplary manner, and \ntook steps to avoid compromise. He is a \u201cgood person\u201d who \u201cwill uphold the laws and \nrequirements of our nation.\u201d (AE J) \nMs. V worked with Applicant more recently, in 2021 and 2022. He was essential \nto the project, and showed vital diligence and attention to detail. He has an excellent \nwork ethic and she is sorry to lose him from her team. He has always endeavored to \nshow the \u201cethical and trustworthy behavior necessary for a security clearance.\u201d (AE K) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant had a duty to file his annual state and Federal income tax returns in a \ntimely manner, and the fact that he did not do so for several years is a security concern. \nAs the Appeal Board has held, in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for several \ntax years, including 2017-2019, as alleged. This establishes AG \u00b6 19(f) specifically, as \nwell as, more generally, AG \u00b6 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax filing issues began when he was working overseas, in about \n2017. He typically uses a well-known tax preparation software program, and he had \ntechnical difficulties accessing the program from overseas. Rather than limit his tax filing \nissues to a single year, his issues snowballed, because, he believed, subsequent tax \nfilings were contingent upon curing previous filing deficiencies. \nApplicant volunteered his tax issues in his 2018 background interview, but still \ntook several years to cure his delinquent filings. Generally, for the tax years at issue \n(2017-2019), Applicant filed his federal returns about three years late. He filed his 2020 \nfederal return (not alleged) about a month after the filing deadline. Applicant also \ndocumented that his State 1 tax returns for the years at issue have also been filed, \nthough it is not clear from his post-hearing documents when he did so. Applicant had \nlittle to no resulting federal or state tax debt, as he appears to have received refunds for \nmost years. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s responsibility under the circumstances, I must consider \nthe timing of his actions. The Appeal Board has consistently held that timing of an \napplicant\u2019s resolution of his tax-filing problems is relevant in evaluating mitigation. An \napplicant who resolves financial or tax problems only when his clearance might be \nimperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules \ngoverning classified information when his personal interests are not at stake. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). The Appeal Board has also held that \nan applicant cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d or \u201call\u2019s well that ends \nwell.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant disclosed his tax issues voluntarily during the security clearance \nprocess. He began addressing his late returns after his SCA and interview but before \nthe SOR was issued, though his efforts continued up to the time of his hearing. Given \nthe timing of Applicant\u2019s actions, he gets some, but not full, credit for good-faith efforts \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d). \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s past-due tax filings are now resolved. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe origin of his tax issues is largely attributable to technical issues with tax preparation \nsoftware that occurred when he was overseas. He is now no longer in that situation. His \ntax issues are limited to a few years, and he had no prior history of prior issues over his \nlong career. His tax filing issues occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, \nand they no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI had ample opportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing and to \nform an opinion of his credibility. He was intelligent, well spoken, and respectful, and he \ntreated the process seriously. I found him to be a credible witness. I also credit his long \ncareer as a DOD, State Department, and Government contractor, in cleared positions. \nWhen balanced against that long and honorable service to the country, his tax issues \nare more of an anomaly than an ongoing risk. I also believe that Applicant has learned \nhis lesson through this experience, and is unlikely to find himself in this position again. \nHe has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. In reaching this \nconclusion, I considered not only Applicant\u2019s credibility, but the record evidence as a \nwhole. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) with explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He married in 2003, separated in about 2011, and divorced in 2014. He has three minor children with his first wife. He was married a second time from 2016-2021, and a third time in 2022. He served on active duty in the Air Force from 2002-2012, and in the Air Force Reserve from 2012-2016. He received an honorable discharge. He has attended some college classes, but has not earned a degree. He has worked for a government contractor in an information technology position since 2017. (Tr. 22-25; GE 1) When Applicant and his first wife separated in about 2011, he signed a support agreement where he agreed to pay $3,000 monthly in child support and alimony. He stated that he was pressured into signing this agreement, and that this amount was almost his whole monthly paycheck. He was advised by base legal counsel not to sign the agreement, but he believed it would impact his military career if he did not. He reported that this support agreement was incorporated into his final divorce decree. He stated that it was rare that he was able to pay his ex-wife the full amount of support, and he would pay her partial cash payments when he was able. After their divorce, he and his ex",

Applicant was given \n30 days to respond to the new allegation and to submit evidence in response. In his \nresponse, he admitted the allegation and submitted tax documentation into the record. \n(Tr. 69-72, 84-87; AE L-O) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) with \nexplanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review \nof the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2003, separated in about 2011, and \ndivorced in 2014. He has three minor children with his first wife. He was married a second \ntime from 2016-2021, and a third time in 2022. He served on active duty in the Air Force \nfrom 2002-2012, and in the Air Force Reserve from 2012-2016. He received an honorable \ndischarge. He has attended some college classes, but has not earned a degree. He has \nworked for a government contractor in an information technology position since 2017. (Tr. \n22-25; GE 1) \nWhen Applicant and his first wife separated in about 2011, he signed a support \nagreement where he agreed to pay $3,000 monthly in child support and alimony. He \nstated that he was pressured into signing this agreement, and that this amount was almost \nhis whole monthly paycheck. He was advised by base legal counsel not to sign the \nagreement, but he believed it would impact his military career if he did not. He reported \nthat this support agreement was incorporated into his final divorce decree. He stated that \nit was rare that he was able to pay his ex-wife the full amount of support, and he would \npay her partial cash payments when he was able. After their divorce, he and his ex-wife \nmoved to State A. In 2017, she filed an enforcement action with the state child support \nagency. He represented himself in the proceeding. While his monthly support obligations \nwere lowered to $1,200, he was assessed with an arrearage of about $122,000. The \ncurrent balance of his outstanding child support is about $134,794.

He and his first \nwife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004, with about $31,000 in liabilities. Over the last \nten years, he has had continual financial delinquencies. He and his first wife had their \nhome foreclosed in 2014. He claimed that they could have sold the home before \nforeclosure, but she would not agree to the sale terms. In 2018, a state tax lien was filed \nagainst him for about $1,800. He stated that he was unaware of the lien, and it has not \nbeen satisfied. These items were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 27-83; GE 6, 10) \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $86,204, and failure to file his federal \nand state income tax returns for 2021. The status of the allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a debt for child support arrears totaling $57,740. The record \nshows that Applicant actually owes $134,794. While it appears that his paycheck has \nbeen consistently garnished since March 2020, he is not meeting his obligations because \nthe balance has steadily grown about $10,000 over three years. He did not provide \ndocumentation showing his track record of payments from earlier dates. (Tr. 27-83; GE \n2, 3, 5; AE K, P) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an auto-loan that has been charged off for $6,545. The vehicle was \nrepossessed in about 2012, after he became separated from his first wife. He has not \ntaken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card placed for collection for $5,043. The debt originates from \nabout 2012. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE \n2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are student loans placed for collection for $2,203 and $1,639, \nrespectively. These debts originated in about 2019. Applicant settled the loans in \nFebruary 2022 for $2,300. (Tr. 51-68; GE 3, 4, 12; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) debt placed for \ncollection for $1,491. This debt originated in 2016. Applicant stated that this debt could \nhave been a tuition overpayment. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3, 4, 12) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l are medical debts placed for collection for $1,306 and $592, \nrespectively. Applicant is unsure of the origin of the first debt. He stated that the second \nmedical debt may be connected to a work injury. He does not know the first creditor and \nhas not taken any action with the second creditor. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 51-\n68; GE 2, 3)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) debt placed for collection for \n$616. Applicant stated that this may have been an overpayment to him from 2015, and \nhe may have made a payment on this debt. He did not provide any documentation \nsupporting this claim.

He has not taken any action on it and this debt \nis unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a utility bill placed for collection for $280. Applicant claims that he \ndoes not know the origin of this debt. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n concerns Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income \nreturns for tax year 2021. He stated that his second wife, who is a bookkeeper, told him \nthat he could file his tax returns at any time. He submitted unsigned federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2021, but did not provide documentation showing that \nthese returns were filed. (Tr. 69-72; AE L, M) \nApplicant failed to provide documentation concerning his current financial \nsituation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a \nbudget. He has not had credit counseling. He submitted three employment records \nshowing that for the last two years his work performance has exceeded expectations and \nmet expectations for three years prior. He submitted four character letters stating that he \nis a valued employee, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 33; AE A, B, C, D, E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to \nresolve the two alleged student loans. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, and I \nfind those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the remaining debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent \nunder such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His failure to pay his delinquent debts \nis both long-term and recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. This continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that his debts or unfiled tax \nreturns occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns for tax year 2021. He did not provide sufficient evidence that \nthe returns have been filed, only that the paperwork has been completed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service and character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F arising out of his delinquent \ndebts and unfiled federal and state income tax returns. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for eligibility for a public \ntrust position in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na public trust position.

There was a question regarding Applicant\u2019s sponsorship \nand the rescheduled hearing was canceled and set for January 25, 2023.

After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He married in 2005 and divorced in 2007. There were no \nchildren from the marriage. He remarried in 2015 and divorced in 2019. He has an eight-\nyear-old child from the marriage. He has custody of the child. He is in a cohabitation \nrelationship. He served in the military from 2004 to 2011 and was honorably discharged. \nApplicant was employed from September 2019 until June 2021. He has been employed \nby a federal contractor since July 2021. (Tr. 43-46, 70-71,74; GE 1) \nIn July 2016, Applicant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, \nOxycodone. Applicant held a security clearance at the time. He testified that he did not \nhave access to classified information, and there is no evidence to the contrary. (Tr. 165; \nGE 2) \nIn February 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. In \nOctober 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). He was \nreinterviewed in November 2019. Applicant was issued government interrogatories and \nhe was advised to make corrections or additions to the summary of interviews. He \nreported updated information about criminal charges and an updated credit report. In \nDecember 2020, he swore to the accuracy of the interviews. (GE 2) \nDuring his initial interview, Applicant was questioned about his July 2016 arrest \nand told the investigator that on July 2, 2016, he had traveled to Mexico for the day. While \nin Mexico, he filled a prescription he had for Oxycodone and then returned home to the \nUnited States. Upon entry into the U.S., he was questioned by Border Protection Agents \nabout the nature of his trip, and he informed them that it had been to refill a prescription \nfor Oxycodone, and he showed the agent the handwritten prescription and the pill bottle \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich contained 15-20 pills. He was then met by a deputy sheriff of the local county. The \ndrug was seized, and Applicant was issued a citation for possession of a controlled \nsubstance. He showed the deputy sheriff the prescription that was obtained from a U.S. \ndoctor. Applicant was advised that it did not matter and was informed he would have to \nappear in court. He was then released. (GE 2) \nApplicant told the investigator that in August 2016 he went to the appropriate court \nand was told by the clerk that no action had been taken on his citation, and he would be \ncontacted at a later date. He further told the investigator that as of the date of his interview \n(February 2017) he had no contact with the court and did not know the status of his case. \nHe said he did not report the misdemeanor citation for possession of a controlled \nsubstance on his SCA because he did not believe he did anything wrong, was not arrested \nand had not had his day in court to prove his innocence. He did not believe he was \nrequired to disclose it on his SCA.1 (GE 2) \nDuring his February 2017 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had a \nprescription for Oxycodone for pain, which at the time he took lawfully and in compliance \nwith the prescription. He began using it sometime in January 2014, and he never abused \nit. Beginning in December 2016, he felt like he was becoming addicted and sought \ntreatment from a different doctor than the one who prescribed it. He was prescribed a \nnew medication for pain and weaned from Oxycodone. He said he had not used \nOxycodone since January 2017. He did not believe he was addicted to it but believed he \nwas headed in that direction. He has not participated in drug counseling and did not have \na diagnosis of opioid addiction. (Tr. 136; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he had a valid prescription for Oxycodone and took it \naccording to the prescription. He said he went to Mexico to have dental work. Upon \nreturning through customs, he declared his medicine, which he said he was not taking at \nthe time. He showed the Border Control agent the bottle of Oxycodone pills. It was an \nolder bottle and not the most current. It was confiscated, his car was searched, and he \nreceived a citation for possession of a controlled substance. He said that he went to the \nwrong courthouse and the hearing was rescheduled. (Tr. 110-115, 167-169) \nIn October 2017, Applicant was charged with felony importation of cocaine. During \nhis November 2019 interview by a government investigator, he explained that he had \ngone to Mexico to a veterinarian to obtain vaccines for his dogs. He rented a car because \nhis vehicle had been recently totaled in an accident. In Mexico, while he was at the \nveterinarian, the vehicle was out of his sight for about three hours. After he finished at the \nveterinarian, he crossed the Mexico-U.S. border on his return to the United States. His \nvehicle was searched and inside the spare tire rim 16 kilos of cocaine were found. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with felony importation of cocaine. He denied the \ndrugs belonged to him and denied he was aware they were in the vehicle.

No investigative report was provided \nthat concluded the drugs did not belong to Applicant. He told the investigator that he pled \nguilty to the charge to fast track his case, and it would allow him to qualify for Veteran\u2019s \nCourt. In December 2017, he entered a plea of guilty to the felony importation of cocaine. \nHe said he believed he would have been convicted of the charge had it gone to trial. He \nwas incarcerated from October 2017 until approximately January or February 2018 and \nthen immediately participated in the Community Resource and Self-Help Program \n(CRASH) where he resided for 90 days. This program is apparently a prerequisite for \nparticipation in Veteran\u2019s Court. (Tr. 67-69, 86-90, 115-118, 150-156) \nAfter release from the CRASH program, while waiting to be accepted to Veteran\u2019s \nCourt, Applicant was restricted from leaving the county. He violated that restriction to go \nvisit his son in another state. He was returned to custody in approximately October 2018. \nHe was in a holding facility and then federal prison from October 2018 until April 2019. \nHe was accepted into the Veteran\u2019s Court program. In April 2019, he filed a motion to \nwithdraw his original plea of guilty, so he could participate in Veteran\u2019s Court. As part of \nthe agreement to allow him to withdraw his plea and participate in Veteran\u2019s Court he had \nto plead guilty to the importation of cocaine charge. It was also learned that he had an \noutstanding charge for possession of a controlled substance from 2016. During his \nNovember 2019 interview, he told the government investigator that in August 2016 he \nwent to the wrong court for this charge and then he assumed the sheriff\u2019s office chose not \nto pursue the charge since no record could be found. He did not follow up on the citation. \nA failure to appear warrant was issued that he was unaware of until his October 2017 \narrest. At his security clearance hearing, he said after he went to the wrong court, he was \ngiven a new date to appear, but he failed to do so because he had been arrested and \nwas incarcerated at that time. He testified that the state agreed to resolve the possession \nof a controlled substance citation while he was a participant in Veteran\u2019s Court. The \ncharge was adjudicated by a different court through a diversion program, which he \ncompleted, and was dismissed in January 2021. (Tr. 118-127, 139-147-150, 159-164; GE \n2) \nThe Veteran\u2019s Court required that Applicant plead guilty to the charge; complete \ninpatient residence; complete three urinalyses a week; attend counseling; complete \ncommunity service; find employment; and participate in therapy. Applicant successfully \ncompleted the program in July 2020. He testified that after three years, he can request to \nhave the charge expunged. Applicant provided the court document that the importation \ncharge was dismissed with prejudice in July 2020. He provided a certificate of completion \nfor the Veterans Village Recovery Program (February 2020) and received alumni status. \nThis program is a one-year inpatient resident program. He was required to attend the \nrequired classes during the day and then he was able to get a job. Applicant completed it \nin 10 months. He also provided a certificate of completion of the Veteran\u2019s Court treatment \nprogram from July 2020.

Under these two sections, he \ndisclosed the following regarding his October 2017 felony arrest and charge for \nimportation of cocaine: \u201cI was traveling from Mexico into the United States on October 3, \n2017. An illegal substance was found in the rental vehicle I was driving. I have not been \nconvicted and the charges are due to be dismissed.\u201d (GE 1) Under Section 23 he wrote: \n\u201cI was not aware of what was in my vehicle while coming back into the United States. All \nmatters have been settled and I was never convicted of any crime, nor did I ever have to \npay an[y] fines concerning this matter.\u201d He said under the reasons sections, \u201cI used to \nlive close to the border while working in [State]. I would to (sic) go down to Mexico for \nbetter priced dental treatments.\u201d (GE 1) He responded \u201cyes\u201d to the questions that asked \nif in the last seven years he had been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, \ncultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, handling or sale of any \ndrug or controlled substance.\u201d (Tr 156-159; GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s November 2019 interview with a government investigator, he \ndiscussed his October 2017 felony offense of importation of cocaine. He was asked by \nthe investigator if he had any other offenses to report and he said \u201cno\u201d. He was confronted \nwith his July 2016 possession of a controlled substance citation. He then explained he \ndid not know why it was not on his SCA because he recalled reporting it, but he could \npossibly not have saved it correctly. He said he had traveled to Mexico to purchase over-\nthe-counter diabetes medication for his aunt and Oxycodone for himself that had been \nprescribed and upon his return to the United States he received the above-mentioned \ncitation. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he went to Mexico on this occasion to \nobtain dental care. He was not sure why he failed to disclose his drug offense citation on \nhis SCA. He then said he did not disclose it because he did not go to court and did not \nthink it was anything serious. (Tr. 136, 138; GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA under Section 11, which asked where he had lived, he did not \ndisclose his incarceration from October 2017 to January or February 2018 or his \nresidence in the CRASH program for 90 days. When the investigator asked him why he \nfailed to disclose where he was living, he explained that he considered these to be \ntransitional, or he did not consider them \u201cresidences,\u201d and he was not required to disclose \nthem. He said he was not intentionally attempting to conceal this information. When asked \nat his hearing why he failed to disclose the information, he testified that he did not know \nwhy he did not disclose it. He was not the same person mentally as he is now. (Tr. 89-92; \nGE 1) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. However, the information may be considered in the application \nof mitigating conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in the whole-person \nanalysis. \nApplicant provided a letter of intent which stated he would never misuse any illegal \nsubstances in the future, including possession of any illegal drug or use any legal drug \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout a prescription.

(AE A) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has six delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$74,386. He testified these debts were incurred during his marriage, and the smaller ones \nhe lost track of due to life events. He disclosed on his October 2019 SCA a credit card \ndebt of approximately $5,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b - actual amount owed $14,923) that became \ndelinquent in May 2017 that he attributed to a divorce and the end of a contract that he \nhad been working on. He said he planned on contacting the creditor to resolve it once he \nwas back at work. He planned on taking the necessary steps to pay the debt in a timely \nmanner. He did not disclose any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 48-49, 95; GE 1) \nDuring his November 2019 interview, Applicant acknowledged he underestimated \nthe amount of his credit card debt. He stated it became delinquent due to the loss of a \ncontract and because he was unemployed while incarcerated in October 2017 for the \nabove-mentioned drug charge. Applicant told the investigator that he did not have any \nother financial issues. He was then confronted with the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($57,793) with \nthe same creditor. He explained he had purchased a travel trailer with a loan from the \ncreditor. The original loan amount was $85,000. He was unable to pay the loan for the \nsame reasons stated above. He told the investigator that he contacted the creditor and \nplanned to make payments on the debt. He said he had started a new job and would pay \nit when he was sure he was able to keep the job. He testified that he did not know why \nhe failed to disclose this debt on his SCA. (Tr. 96; GE 2) \nIn November 2019 Applicant acknowledged to the investigator the four remaining \ndebts that are alleged in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c - $849, 1.d - $641, 1.e - $143, 1.f - $37). He told \nthe investigator that his finances were stable, he was able and willing to pay his debts, \nand he would not likely experience future financial problems. In his answer to the SOR, \nhe provided documents to show he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e and 1.f in \nFebruary 2021. He testified that he paid them after he received the SOR. (Tr. 48-51, 79-\n80; GE 2, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2021 answer to the SOR, he said was working on repaying \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and he was taking all actions required to restore his \ncredit. He testified he started to miss payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2017. He said \nhe delayed resolving the debt because in approximately 2020 he was involved in a costly \nchild custody dispute. At his hearing, he provided letters dated February 14, 2023, from \nthe creditor confirming settlement offers of $26,006 for SOR \u00b6 1.a and $6,696 for SOR \u00b6 \n1.b with monthly payments of $650 and $270, respectively, for 40 months until June 2026. \nHe provided copies of payments made in February and March 2023. (Tr. 52; Answer to \nSOR; GE 4, 5, 6, 7; AE B, E, F) \nApplicant testified that his finances and job are stable.

He believes Applicant is very \ntruthful and honest. He trusts him to safeguard classified information. (Tr. 28-33) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified on his behalf. Applicant worked for him \nstarting in August 2021 and they are friends. He testified that Applicant\u2019s performance \nwas reliable and trustworthy. He would trust Applicant to handle classified information. \n(Tr. 34-40) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts totaling approximately $74,686 that he began \naccumulating in 2017. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debt in 2017. He paid his small \ndelinquent debts in 2021, after receiving the SOR. Despite promises to address the two \nlarge debts, he failed to take action on them until days before his hearing. Applicant \nattributed his delinquent debts to the loss of a contract, divorce, child custody, and \nunemployment. The unemployment was primarily due to his incarceration after being \ncharged with a serious drug offense. Although some of the reasons were beyond his \ncontrol, the criminal offenses were not. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because some of his \ndebts are ongoing and unpaid. Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) has minimal application. There is no evidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the four small delinquent debts he paid. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant pleaded guilty to a felony for importation of cocaine in 2019 for an offense \nthat occurred in 2017. He received a citation for possession of a controlled substance, \nOxycodone in 2016. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s felony charge for importation of cocaine was adjudicated in Veteran\u2019s \nCourt. After completion of the requirements by the court, the charge was dismissed with \nprejudice. The misdemeanor offense of possession of a controlled substance, Oxycodone \nwas adjudicated through a diversion program and was also dismissed. Applicant\u2019s past \ncriminal conduct is serious. I am unable to find it occurred under unique circumstances. \nApplicant had the benefit of having his charges adjudicated with the Veteran\u2019s Court. \nAlthough, both charges have been dismissed, it was after completion of the program, not \nbecause they did not occur. Applicant pleaded guilty to both. His serious criminal conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His completion of the \nVeteran\u2019s Court\u2019s requirements and current employment provides some mitigation, but it \ndoes not negate the seriousness of his prior criminal conduct. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, Oxycodone. He \nbelieved he might become addicted to it. He said he had a valid prescription. He was also \ncharged with importation of 16 kilos of cocaine. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant testified that he has not used Oxycodone since January 2017. There is \nno evidence to the contrary. He possessed a significant amount of cocaine. Part of the \nrequirements of the Veteran\u2019s Court diversion program was to submit three times a week \nto a urinalysis. Presumably he would not have been released from the program if he had \ntested positive. He provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse. I find there is sufficient evidence to conclude he will not use illegal \ndrugs or misuse legal drugs in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, H and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. He resolved his small delinquent \ndebts but failed to take meaningful action on his two largest debts until days before his \nhearing, despite being aware of the security concerns. He has not established a meaning \nfinancial track record to conclude he will faithfully comply with resolving these two large \ndebts. Although, Applicant completed the requirements imposed by the Veteran\u2019s Court \nfor his felony offense, the seriousness of his offense is significant and not mitigated. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns. He \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations and clarifications, except for SOR \u00b6 1.d. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He married in January 1994 and divorced in August 2017 (he and his wife were separated at various times between 2013 and 2017). He and his wife adopted two daughters who are now ages 24 and 21. The oldest daughter (D1) has special needs and is unable to live independently. Applicant provides her approximately $1,200 in monthly support payments. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is D1\u2019s legal guardian and custodian. Applicant was granted weekend visitation privileges and D1 spends the weekends with him. (Tr. 53-55, 65-66, 87; GE 1) Applicant holds a master\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, for five years. He is a senior software engineer. He has previously worked for federal contractors, including his current employer.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 10, 2023, \nand the hearing was held as scheduled on April 10, 2023. The Government offered \nexhibits (GE) 1-8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, \noffered the testimony of two witnesses, and offered exhibits (AE) A-V, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record remained open for additional submissions and \nhe timely submitted AE W-Y, admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 18, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations and \nclarifications, except for SOR \u00b6 1.d. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. He married in January 1994 and divorced in August \n2017 (he and his wife were separated at various times between 2013 and 2017). He \nand his wife adopted two daughters who are now ages 24 and 21. The oldest daughter \n(D1) has special needs and is unable to live independently. Applicant provides her \napproximately $1,200 in monthly support payments. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is D1\u2019s legal \nguardian and custodian. Applicant was granted weekend visitation privileges and D1 \nspends the weekends with him. (Tr. 53-55, 65-66, 87; GE 1) \nApplicant holds a master\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current employer, a \nfederal contractor, for five years. He is a senior software engineer. He has previously \nworked for federal contractors, including his current employer. He has held a security \nclearance since 1996. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleged Applicant: (1) in about 2002, was treated by \nDr. R, who diagnosed him with depression and prescribed antidepressant medication; \n(2) in June 2013, attempted suicide by using a pressurized nail gun; (3) in May 2017, \nceased taking his prescribed antidepressant medication, without medical authorization, \nand thereafter experienced suicide ideations involving use of a nail gun; and in June \n2021, was evaluated by a licensed psychologist who diagnosed him with Major \nDepressive Disorder, recurrent, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, mild, without intellectual \nimpairment. The psychologist opined that Applicant exercised questionable or impaired \njudgment when in an emotionally charged social and interpersonal situation. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a - 1.d) \nUnder Guideline K, the SOR alleged five separate security infractions as follows: \n(1) in May 2009 and (2) in June 2015, Applicant brought a personal cell phone into a \nsecured area; (3) in May 2016, he failed to properly log-off of a classified computer in a \nsecured area; (4) between March 2018 and December 2018, he brought unauthorized \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nelectronic devices into a secured area on four separate occasions; and (5) in October \n2019, he failed to properly secure a closed area. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.e) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged in June 2014, Applicant was involved in a \ndomestic issue where the police became involved when there was physical contact \nbetween Applicant and his wife; in June 2015, Applicant was questioned by the police \nabout stalking a member of his medical care team; and in October 2016, he was \narrested and charged with assaulting his wife and committing child abuse on his \ndaughter. All the allegations listed under Guidelines I and K were-cross alleged under \nGuideline E. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a - 3.e) \nPsychological Conditions. \nApplicant admitted being diagnosed in 2002 with depression. He was prescribed \nantidepressant medication by a doctor. During his June 2021, mental health evaluation \nconducted by Dr. N, at the request of the DOD, he indicated he was prescribed \nmedication for depression as early as 1985 or 1986. (Tr. 59-60; GE 4) \nApplicant attempted to commit suicide in 2013 after he had been diagnosed with \ncancer in 2010 and believed he only had a few years to live. He explained that he was \nconcerned about his family and thought that a $350,000 life insurance policy, which \nexpired in a few days, could provide financial support for his family upon his death. He \nused a pressured nail gun in this instance. He further stated that his equipment failed. \nHe testified that he never actually pointed the gun at himself, but he thought about doing \nso. In his September 2013 security clearance application (SCA), he used the words \u201cmy \nfailed suicide attempt\u201d to describe his actions that day. (Tr. 60-61, 89-90; GE 3) \nDuring his December 2017 background interview, Applicant admitted to having \nsuicidal ideations using his nail gun. He was concerned enough about his thoughts that \nhe gave the nail gun to a friend to hold for him. In his interview, he stated that he had \nthese thoughts because he had stopped taking his medication. He did so by not getting \nhis prescriptions refilled. He was consciously trying to see how he could get along \nwithout the medication. During his testimony, he claimed that his medication stoppage \nwas due to a mix-up by his insurance company. He stated this one-month stoppage was \nunintentional by him. Applicant believes these circumstances occurred in 2018, as \nopposed to May 2017, as alleged in the SOR. His belief is based upon an email he sent \nto his employer advising that he had called a suicide prevention hotline. He continues to \ntake the medications listed in AE S. (Tr. 61-64; GE 7; AE S-T) \nIn June 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist, Dr. N, who\nwas approved by the DOD. For his assessment, Dr. N reviewed Applicant\u2019s record, \nconducted testing, and performed a two-hour clinical interview with Applicant. Applicant \ntold Dr. N of his 2013 aborted suicide attempt. He also described his 2017 suicidal \nideations when he intentionally went off his antidepressant medication. Applicant denied \nany current suicidal ideations or depressive symptoms. Dr. N diagnosed Applicant using \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) with \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cMajor Depressive Disorder, recurrent\u201d; \u201cAutism Spectrum Disorder, mild, without \naccompanying intellectual impairment.\u201d Dr. N concluded absent effective therapy, it \nwould be reasonable to expect that Applicant might demonstrate impaired judgment \nwhen his emotions run high in the future, as has occurred in the past in social and \ninterpersonal situations. Applicant last saw a counselor in 2019 for approximately two \nmonths when he was going through the guardianship issue with his ex-wife. Dr. N gave \nApplicant a \u201cfair\u201d prognosis. (Tr. 67, 112-113, 118; GE 4) \nIn December 2021, Applicant participated in and paid for a second psychological \nevaluation. This evaluation was conduct by Dr. B, a licensed psychologist. There is no \nevidence to indicate whether Dr. B was \u201cacceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment.\u201d Dr. B conducted a clinical interview with Applicant, put him through a \nseries of tests, and conducted a chart review. Applicant reported current difficulties with \nanger and irritability. This anger is directed at others. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with \nPersistent Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Complex Trauma (by \nhistory). Dr. B encouraged Applicant to consider counseling services, which would help \nthe re-orientation of depression, self-esteem issues, and functional difficulties. Dr. B did \nnot offer a prognosis for Applicant. In April 2023, Dr. B supplemented her earlier \nassessment by clarifying that while Applicant could benefit from life skills coaching and \nongoing executive function, it was not a \u201cnecessity\u201d for him to do so. (Tr. 68; AE I, X) \nProtected Information. \nApplicant admitted that between 2009 and 2019, he committed eight different \nsecurity violations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b, 2.d) Six of the violations involved similar conduct \nwhen he inadvertently took his cell phone, or similar electronic device, into a secure \narea without proper authorization in 2009, 2015, and four times between March and \nDecember 2018. The violations did not involve disclosure of classified information. \nApplicant self-reported all these violations. He received retraining after the violations. \nAfter the last 2018 violation, he was given a written warning that additional violations \ncould result in disciplinary action. (Tr. 68, 71; GE 6; SOR answer; AE U) \nThe two remaining security violations occurred when Applicant failed to properly \nlog-off a classified computer in May 2016. Applicant testified that he was distracted \naway from the logged-in computer and forgot to come back to log-out. This was an \ninadvertent violation and no spillage occurred. In October 2019, Applicant was \nresponsible for securing a closed lab area. He set the alarm but failed to properly \nsecure the door. He told a background investigator that he must have \u201cspaced out\u201d \nsecuring the door. This violation was discovered by security personnel. He has not had \nanother security incident since the one in October 2019. (Tr. 68, 74, 114; GE 7 (p. 20); \nSOR answer; AE U) \nApplicant explained that his behavior that resulted in these eight security \nincidents was heavily influenced by various distractions going on in his personal life at \nthe time. These distractions included his divorce proceedings, which initially started in \n2013, but were protracted, and ended in his final divorce in September 2017. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, he was involved in a contentious guardianship battle with his ex-wife over \nphysical custody of his adult special-needs daughter. He sought the services of a \ncounselor when he was going through the guardianship process. The guardianship \naction began sometime in 2019 and ended with a judge\u2019s order naming Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife the primary legal guardian for their daughter in February 2020. He testified that he \ndoes not have these distractions present in his life now and is confident that future \nsecurity incidents will not occur. (Tr. 75, 115-116, 118) \nPersonal Conduct. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b cross-allege conduct also alleged under the psychological \nconditions and handling protected information guidelines. The facts involving those \nallegations are stated above and will not be repeated here. \nApplicant admitted that the police were called to his home in June 2014. He was \nnot arrested and no charges resulted. He was brushing D1\u2019s teeth when he and his \nthen-wife got into an argument. He claims that she slapped him and he pushed her \ndown. He made sure he protected her landing using his hands and body. (Tr. 75-77, \nSOR answer) \nIn June 2015, Applicant was questioned by the police looking into a complaint \nthat he was stalking or harassing a hospital staff member who had previously treated \nhim. Applicant admitted this happened. He received treatment at a local hospital in June \n2015 and noticed one of the female treatment team members. He decided he wanted to \ntalk with her and possibly have coffee or lunch with her. He did not approach her that \nday. A few days later, he returned to the hospital with the intent to talk with this woman. \nAfter waiting for about an hour, he was approached by a nurse seeking to assist him. \nHe explained he wanted to talk to the female. The nurse explained that the other \nwoman was happily married and Applicant left the hospital. Sometime later, he wrote \nthe woman a letter where he expressed his feelings for her and explained that he was in \na loveless marriage. He delivered it to the hospital and left. A few days later he received \na call from a police officer. The officer explained the law regarding stalking and warned \nhim from contacting the women again. After a few more days, Applicant decided to write \nthe women an apology letter. He met with the police officer again and the officer refused \nto take the women his apology letter and advised him not to send it. The woman sent \nApplicant a text and in no uncertain terms told him that she never wanted to see or hear \nfrom him again. Since that time, there has been no further interaction with her. (Tr. 77-\n78, 98; GE 7 ( pp. 16-17)) \nApplicant admitted that in October 2016, he was arrested for assaulting his wife \nand committing child abuse-no injury toward his youngest daughter (D2). Applicant and \nhis then-wife got into an argument concerning a note he had written. She possessed the \nnote in her hand and he tried to wrestle it away. He eventually bit her hand. D2 was \npresent during this altercation and called the police. Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with assault and non-injury child abuse (because D2 was present and \nwitnessed his assault).

(Tr. 78-82, 104; GE 7 (pp. 9-10); AE \nD) \nCharacter Evidence/Performance Reviews. \nApplicant presented the testimony of two witnesses who were coworkers (who \nalso wrote letters of support) and letters of support from two of his sisters and one \nadditional coworker. One coworker and former supervisor worked with Applicant from \n2019 to 2020. He is aware of all the SOR allegations. He held a clearance for 33 years \nbefore he retired in 2021. He stated that Applicant is a very good software engineer. He \nbelieves that the security incidents were minor and Applicant has learned from them so \nthat they should not happen in the future. He believes Applicant is honest and \ntrustworthy and has no concerns with him possessing a security clearance. (Tr. 16, 20-\n25; AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s second witness worked with Applicant from 1997 to 2013. He has \nheld a clearance for 35 years. He is also a retired naval reserve officer. He is aware of \nthe SOR allegations. During his work experience with Applicant, he was professional in \nhis job performance, very intelligent, and always protected classified information. He \nwas not concerned about Applicant\u2019s past security infractions because he was going \nthrough personal events at the time that are no longer present. He is aware that \nApplicant\u2019s care and concern for D1 caused additional stress in his life. He has not \nworked with Applicant since 2013. (Tr. 39-40, 43-47, 51; AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s third coworker wrote that during the time they worked together from \n2004 to 2007, Applicant had no security incidents. His two sisters wrote that Applicant is \nvery intelligent and honest. He has never revealed any work details to them. (AE E) \nApplicant provided three years of his work performance appraisals (2020-2022). \nIn 2020, he was given an overall rating of \u201cachieved/substantially achieved.\u201d In 2021, his \nsupervisor noted that Applicant improved his relationships with coworkers and managed \nhis time better. In 2022, his supervisor noted that Applicant was directed to apologize to \na team member for comments he made. His supervisor also noted his concern over \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cattitude behavior.\u201d Applicant was also asked to prioritize his life situations \nso outside pressures or situations are not projected into his work environment. (AE F) \nApplicant provided information about coworkers\u2019 positive comments during his \ncurrent employment.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking \nmental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant attempted suicide in 2013 with a nail gun and had suicidal ideations in \n2017, again with a nail gun. In 2021, Dr. N diagnosed him with Major Depressive \nDisorder, recurrent. He further stated that absent effective therapy, Applicant could \ndemonstrate impaired judgment when emotions run high in the future. He gave a \nguarded \u201cfair\u201d prognosis. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, Applicant\u2019s 2002 treatment by a doctor who diagnosed him with depression and \nprescribed him antidepressant medication, does not state a disqualifying condition. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant admitted that he has not received treatment since 2020 when the \nguardianship case ended. He apparently remains on his antidepressant medication, but \nhe has gone off his medication as recently as 2017. There was no evidence presented \nof a formal treatment plan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) do not apply. In June 2021, Applicant \nwas diagnosed by Dr. N with Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, and who gave him a \n\u201cfair\u201d prognosis. In November to December 2021, Dr. B, Applicant\u2019s psychologist \nconducted an independent assessment, agreed with Dr. N concerning a \u201cpersistent \ndepressive disorder.\u201d She also diagnosed Applicant with social anxiety disorder. She did \nnot give a prognosis. She is a licensed psychologist, but there is no evidence she was \napproved by the Government. While Dr. B\u2019s opinions offer some positivity to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation, they do not overcome the concerns expressed by Dr. N. AG \u00b6 29(c) does not \nfully apply. Applicant has experienced depression since 2002, attempted or thought of \nself-harm dating back to 2013, and continues taking antidepressant medication, \nindicating his conditions are not temporary, nor have they been resolved. AG \u00b6 29(d) \ndoes not apply. Based upon Dr. N\u2019s 2021 diagnoses and prognosis, Applicant still has \ncurrent psychological problems. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nI have considered all the handling protected information disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 34 and determined the following apply: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant had eight documented security incidents from 2009 to 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n34(g) and 34(h) apply. \nAll the mitigating conditions for handling protected information under AG \u00b6 35 \nwere considered and the following were found relevant under these circumstances: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant has not had a security violation since August 2019. His explanation for \nthe pattern of violations that occurred between 2009 and 2019 is that he was distracted \nby personal circumstances doing those time frames. Those circumstances included \ncaring for a special-needs child, going through a contentious divorce, and going through \na guardianship court battle over D1. He asserts that the distracting factors are now in \nthe past. Yet, he still must care for and financially support D1, and according to his 2022 \nperformance report, he has allowed personal pressures and situations to impact his \nwork. Hence the type of emotional distractions that led to his earlier security violations \nare still present. AG \u00b6 35(a) does not fully apply. \nAs he committed security violations after undergoing counseling and remedial \ntraining, AG \u00b6 35(b) does not apply. While his security violations were inadvertent, \npromptly reported, and lacked evidence of spillage, a pattern is certainly apparent. As \nhis history has shown, when Applicant is distracted by events in his personal life, he is \napt to commit a security violation.AG \u00b6 35(d) does not fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nand \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant admitted to two domestic violence incidents in 2014 and 2016, the \nmost recent of which ended up with criminal charges filed. He also admitted that he was \ninvolved with the police when a hospital employee complained that he might be stalking \nher in 2015. This conduct raises the disqualifying conditions listed under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nand 16(e). Applicant\u2019s conduct involving psychological concerns and committing \nsecurity infractions are covered by those guidelines as set forth in AG \u00b6 16(d), are \nsufficient for an adverse determination, and therefore are not disqualifying under \nGuideline E. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b are found for Applicant under this guideline only. \nAll the mitigating conditions for handling protected information under AG \u00b6 17 \nwere considered and the following were found relevant under these circumstances: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe most recent incident occurred in 2016, before Applicant was divorced. No \nfurther incidents of this nature have occurred since then. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n3.c-3.d. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s character \nevidence, the difficulties in caring for D1, his medical history, and Dr. B\u2019s assessment. \nHowever, I also considered the diagnosis and prognosis of Dr. N and that Applicant is \nnot currently receiving counseling. I also considered that, despite his assertions to the \ncontrary, his personal circumstances in 2022 were significant enough for his supervisor \nto comment on their effect on his job performance in his annual appraisal. Applicant \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the psychological conditions or handling \nprotected information security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines I and K. \nConcerns under Guideline E were either not established or mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs   1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   3.a-3.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 31, has worked for a federal contracting company as a program analyst since June 2016. He completed his first security clearance application in 2014, and was initially granted a security clearance in 2015. He completed his most recent security clearance application in September 2019. The investigation revealed that Applicant owed $45,560 for 12 delinquent student loans. (GE 1- 3) Applicant attended college from August 2009 to May 2014. Since graduating, he has not experienced any period of unemployment. He is unmarried and has no dependents. He lives rent-free in his parents\u2019 home, but contributes between $200 and $500 each month toward household expenses. He uses his salary, which is now approximately $57,000 annually, toward traveling and other personal expenses. Applicant testified that he did not pay his student loans because they slipped his mind. He made a few payments after the servicer contacted him in 2015 and 2016. He did not make any payments after mid-2016 and defaulted on the loans in April 2019. (GE 1-3; Tr. 8-25, 31-34) After receiving the SOR in January 2021, Applicant contacted the collection agency to rehabilitate the loans. He completed the rehabilitation program in November 2021. The loans have not been consolidated. They remain 12 separate accounts, each with their own repayment terms.

This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to grant his security clearance.

DOHA received the transcript on August 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 31, has worked for a federal contracting company as a program \nanalyst since June 2016. He completed his first security clearance application in 2014, \nand was initially granted a security clearance in 2015. He completed his most recent \nsecurity clearance application in September 2019. The investigation revealed that \nApplicant owed $45,560 for 12 delinquent student loans. (GE 1- 3) \nApplicant attended college from August 2009 to May 2014. Since graduating, he \nhas not experienced any period of unemployment. He is unmarried and has no \ndependents. He lives rent-free in his parents\u2019 home, but contributes between $200 and \n$500 each month toward household expenses. He uses his salary, which is now \napproximately $57,000 annually, toward traveling and other personal expenses. \nApplicant testified that he did not pay his student loans because they slipped his mind. \nHe made a few payments after the servicer contacted him in 2015 and 2016. He did not \nmake any payments after mid-2016 and defaulted on the loans in April 2019. (GE 1-3; \nTr. 8-25, 31-34) \nAfter receiving the SOR in January 2021, Applicant contacted the collection \nagency to rehabilitate the loans. He completed the rehabilitation program in November \n2021. The loans have not been consolidated. They remain 12 separate accounts, each \nwith their own repayment terms. Because of the student loan payment pause initiated \nby President Biden in March 2020, Applicant is not currently required to make payments \non the accounts. However, the servicer informed him that the pause did not prohibit him \nfrom making payments. Applicant has chosen not to do so, and plans to pay the loans \nwhen \nthe \npause \nexpires \nin \napproximately \nAugust \n2023. \n(See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-interest, \nCOVID-19 Loan Payment Pause and 0% Interest; AE A-D) \nAfter paying his recurring expenses each month, which includes his car payment, \ncell phone, and a medical subscription payment, Applicant has between $1,200 and \n$1,300 in disposable income. He has less than $10,000 in other assets. The repayment \nterms of the 12 loans are unclear from the record, but he testified that he would be able \nto afford the payments.

He \ndisclosed a 2013 eviction for non-payment of rent and the settlement of that $11,000 \naccount in 2014. He explained the origin of the debt and provided a detailed explanation \nof its resolution. He did not disclose his delinquent student loan accounts. In his \nFebruary 2020 subject interview, the background investigator asked Applicant if he had \nbeen over 120 days delinquent on any debt; to which Applicant answered \u2018no\u2019. After the \ninvestigator confronted him with evidence of the student loan accounts, Applicant \nacknowledged that he owed the accounts, explaining that he had not paid the student \nloans because they slipped his mind and that he had other bills to pay. At the hearing, \nhe could not provide a reason for failing to disclose his delinquent student loan \naccounts. (GE 1-2; Tr. 31, 38-40) \nThe record contains a January 2020 credit report. Applicant\u2019s credit history \nbegins in September 2009, when he opened his first student loan accounts. Aside from \nthe 12 student loan accounts, Applicant only has four other consumer credit accounts, \nwhich he opened between 2016 and 2017. Those four accounts are in good standing. \nThe only reported derogatory accounts are the defaulted student loans. (GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk\nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6\n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. Despite having the\nmeans to do so, Applicant failed to pay his 12 student loan accounts which went into \ndefault in April 2019. The following financial considerations disqualifying conditions\napply:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAlthough the Applicant has successfully rehabilitated the loans, he has not \nmitigated the alleged security concerns. He did not provide a reasonable explanation for \nhis decision to default on his student loans. Since graduating from college, he has not \nexperienced any financial or personal issues that has prevented him from doing so. He \nonly began the rehabilitation process after receiving the SOR in January 2021. Since \nrehabilitating his loans in November 2021, he has not demonstrated a track record of \nloan repayment. While he is not required to make any payments under the student loan \npayment pause, he is not prohibited from doing so. In this case, the lack of payment \nhistory does not lend credibility to his promise to pay the debts when the pause expires. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgement, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. (AG\u00b6 15) The \nSOR alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose 12 delinquent student loans in \nresponse to questions under Section 26 \u2013 Financial Records. Specifically, the section \nseeks information about any delinquent Federal debts; any defaulted loans; any debts \nturned over to a collection agency; and any debts over 120 days past due in the seven \nyears preceding the security clearance application. \nApplicant admitted that he did not pay his student loans, only making sporadic \npayments when contacted by the loan servicer. He defaulted on the accounts in April \n2019. He denies the falsification allegations, claiming that the omission was not \nintentional, and that the student loans slipped his mind. A finding of intentional \nfalsification requires a finding of fact as to an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the alleged \nfalsification occurred. On its own, an omission does not prove or establish intent or state \nof mind. In this case, the record contains sufficient evidence of circumstantial evidence \nof Applicant\u2019s intent to falsify his security clearance application. Accordingly, the \nfollowing disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation about the omission was not credible. The student loans and the servicer\u2019s \ncollection attempts were contemporaneous to his completion of the security clearance \napplication. His explanation proves even less credible given the detailed disclosure he \nprovided about his 2013 eviction, a matter resolved five years before he completed the \nSeptember 2019 application. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s financial history is not very \nextensive and is comprised mostly of student loans. Of the 16 accounts reported on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, 12 are the delinquent student loans. It is unlikely that he was \nunaware of their status or that he did not think of the loans when completing the security \nclearance application. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant did not meet his burden of production or \npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns raised in the SOR. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has worked since June 2019. He received a high school diploma in 2015. He has never been married and has no children. He served on active duty with the Army from April 2016 until May 2019 when he received a general discharge for misconduct. (Items 3, 10) Within the last five years, Applicant began having issues with alcohol. When he returned from Army deployments, he was finishing a bottle of tequila in one or two days to deal with stress. In June or July 2018, after speaking about his alcohol use with his non-commissioned officer (NCO), he enrolled in the Army\u2019s Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care (SUDCC). His NCO gave him the choice of self-enrolling in SUDCC, or his NCO would refer him. While he was enrolled in SUDCC, he was required to abstain from consuming alcohol. He met with his SUDCC counselor once every two weeks from June or July 2018 until he stopped his SUDCC treatment in May 2019 when he was discharged from the Army. He provided no evidence that he has undergone any alcohol-related treatment since May 2019. He did not complete the SUDCC treatment program, but in October 2018, he completed a portion of that treatment called Prime for Life. There is no evidence as to what treatment or counseling the Prime for Life portion of the SUDCC entailed.

The Government exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-10) are admitted in \nevidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since June 2019. He received a high school diploma in 2015. He has never \nbeen married and has no children. He served on active duty with the Army from April \n2016 until May 2019 when he received a general discharge for misconduct. (Items 3, \n10) \nWithin the last five years, Applicant began having issues with alcohol. When he \nreturned from Army deployments, he was finishing a bottle of tequila in one or two days \nto deal with stress. In June or July 2018, after speaking about his alcohol use with his \nnon-commissioned officer (NCO), he enrolled in the Army\u2019s Substance Use Disorder \nClinical Care (SUDCC). His NCO gave him the choice of self-enrolling in SUDCC, or his \nNCO would refer him. While he was enrolled in SUDCC, he was required to abstain \nfrom consuming alcohol. He met with his SUDCC counselor once every two weeks from \nJune or July 2018 until he stopped his SUDCC treatment in May 2019 when he was \ndischarged from the Army. He provided no evidence that he has undergone any \nalcohol-related treatment since May 2019. He did not complete the SUDCC treatment \nprogram, but in October 2018, he completed a portion of that treatment called Prime for \nLife. There is no evidence as to what treatment or counseling the Prime for Life portion \nof the SUDCC entailed. (Items 2, 3, 6, 9, 10) \nIn about November 2018, while he was attending SUDCC treatment and was \nrequired to abstain from alcohol, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI) in State A. He had been consuming wine, tequila, and rum \nat a social gathering until he blacked out. While he was blacked out from being \nintoxicated, he drove his car and \u201cwrecked the car between a tree and a boat dock near \na lake.\u201d Police gave him a breathalyzer test some hours after he had stopped drinking \nand he had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) percentage. He spent two days in jail. As \npart of a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. \nApplicant paid fines and attended a court-ordered Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n(MADD) meeting. He also received an official memorandum of reprimand from his Army \ncommand. He continued to attend treatment with SUDCC after his November 2018 \narrest, when he was again required to abstain from alcohol. (Items 2-6, 9, 10) \nIn about March 2019, while Applicant was undergoing SUDCC treatment and \nrequired to abstain from alcohol, he was arrested and charged with DUI in State B. He \nhad been drinking alcohol at a cookout the day before his arrest. He claimed that he \ninitially did not know the punch he was drinking at the cookout was laced with alcohol, \nbut he acknowledged that he realized it had alcohol in it that night when he became \nintoxicated. The next morning, he drove to work on base and was stopped by military \npolice for swerving. He claimed that he was trying to avoid potholes because he was \ndriving a friend\u2019s car. He failed field sobriety tests and was issued a breathalyzer test at \nabout 9:00 a.m., the results of which were a .13 BAC percentage.

The court sentenced him to 12 months of probation, suspended his driver\u2019s license \nin State B, and ordered him to perform 24 hours of community service. Because he was \nintoxicated while on duty, the Army charged him under Article 112 of the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ). On April 9, 2019, he was found guilty of that UCMJ charge. \nAs a result of his failure to follow SUDCC requirements, his DUIs, and his UCMJ \ncharges, he was administratively separated from the Army in May 2019 for misconduct. \nDespite being alleged in the SOR, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s March 2019 DUI \ninvolved personal injury. (Items 2, 3, 7-10) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder (moderate) and that the treatment providers at SUDCC advised \nhim to abstain from alcohol. In February 2020, he stated that he planned to remove \ndrinking (alcohol) from his life. Notwithstanding this diagnosis, the SUDCC \nrecommendation, and his earlier plans to abstain from alcohol, in his response to the \nSOR, he stated that he believes that he can continue consuming alcohol in a modified \nmanner because quitting \u201ccold turkey\u201d is not the best option for everyone. Applicant \nclaimed that he drinks beer about two to three times per month. He has also claimed \nthat he drinks about one or two beers two to three times every two weeks. He claimed \nthat he tries to stay away from liquor. He cites to his three years of not having alcohol-\nrelated legal issues as evidence that his modified consumption plan is working. He also \nclaimed that he was named employee of the month at his job, he has been able to buy a \nhouse, and he has no financial problems. (Items 2, 9, 10) \nIn about August 2018, Applicant was charged with larceny in State B when he \ntook an audio cable from a store without paying for it. He claimed he attached the cable \nto see if it fit his phone while he was in the store, accidentally put the cable in his pocket \nwhen he was done using it, forgot that the cable was in his pocket, and then walked out \nof the store without paying for it. The charges against him were ultimately dropped. \nApplicant failed to disclose this larceny charge on his July 2019 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), despite being required to do so. \nHe claimed that he did not think he needed to include it on his e-QIP because the \ncharges were dismissed. He divulged other derogatory information on his e-QIP, such \nas his two DUIs. (Items 2, 10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has two DUI arrests. Despite being convicted of DUI on only one of \nthose occasions, he was driving while intoxicated both times. The second time he was \narrested for DUI, he was on military duty. During his SUDCC treatment, he was \ndiagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and was advised that he should abstain from \nalcohol consumption. As evidenced by his continued alcohol consumption, he has not \nfollowed that treatment recommendation. The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nWhile Applicant has not had an alcohol-related incident in almost four years, he \ncontinues to consume alcohol, which is against the treatment advice that the SUDCC \nprovided him. His alcohol consumption issues are recurring. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant has taken steps to acknowledge and correct his problem with \nalcohol by modifying his consumption, he continues to consume alcohol in \ncontravention of his treatment recommendation. He has not provided sufficient evidence \nof a clear and established pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. \nApplicant is not in an alcohol-treatment program. He was enrolled in the SUDCC \nbut did not complete that program. While undergoing treatment in the SUDCC program, \nhe twice was intoxicated while driving despite being required to abstain from alcohol. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) and AG \u00b6 23(d) do not apply. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that any of the Guideline \nG mitigating conditions fully apply. The alcohol consumption security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant engaged in DUI in 2018 and 2019. In 2019, he was intoxicated while on \nduty and was charged under the UCMJ. He was also charged with larceny of an audio \ncable in 2018. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been almost four years since Applicant last engaged in criminal behavior. \nHowever, much of his criminal behavior was alcohol related. He continues to drink \nalcohol despite a treatment recommendation that he should abstain. Given his history of \ncriminal issues that are alcohol related, while he continues to consume alcohol, I cannot \nfind that he has provided sufficient evidence that his criminal behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nThere is reliable evidence in the form of police reports and military and court \nrecords to support that Applicant committed the offenses alleged in the SOR except for \nthe larceny charge alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. With respect to that larceny charge, there is \nevidence that Applicant put the audio cable he had not paid for in his pocket and was \ncharged with a crime. The charges were dropped and there is no evidence in the record \nas to what the elements are of larceny in State B. For example, there is no evidence in \nthe record as to whether a particular intent is required or whether the act of putting the \ncable in his pocket was inherently illegal. Without more, there is insufficient evidence of \nthe crime of larceny and AG \u00b6 32(c) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. I find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant claimed that he has a good employment record and that he has \ncomplied with the terms of his DUI conviction and his charges under the UCMJ. \nHowever, because he continues to consume alcohol in contravention of his treatment \nrecommendation, and because most of his criminal behavior involved alcohol, I cannot \nfind that enough time has passed to show that there is sufficient evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. \nExcept for the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant has not provided sufficient \nevidence to show that any of the Guideline J mitigating conditions fully apply. The \ncriminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant\u2019s military discharge for misconduct and his UCMJ conviction for DUI \nwhile on duty are explicitly covered under Guideline J and are sufficient for an adverse \nfinding under that guideline. AG \u00b6 16(c) and AG \u00b6 16(d) are not established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant did not divulge his 2018 shoplifting charge in his e-QIP, this \ncharge was dismissed, and he claimed that he did not understand that he was required \nto list charges that had been dismissed. I find this explanation to be a reasonable one. I \nalso note that Applicant listed other, more serious derogatory criminal information on his \ne-QIP. This action undermines the notion that Applicant was deliberately attempting to \nhide derogatory criminal information. Given these considerations, I find there is \ninsufficient evidence that he deliberately provided false information or concealed or \nomitted relevant information. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. For these reasons, the \npersonal conduct security concerns are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service, notwithstanding his discharge for misconduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns, but the \npersonal conduct security concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst \nApplicant \n(with \nthe \nexception of the allegation in \nsubparagraph 1.b that there was \npersonal injury involved in the \nMarch 2019 DUI criminal charge) \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst \nApplicant \n(with \nthe \nexception of the allegation that \nthere \nwas \npersonal \ninjury \ninvolved in the March 2019 DUI \ncriminal charge) \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He married his current spouse in February 2013 and divorced his first spouse in May 2013. (Item 3 at 17 and 18.) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1996 to 2016 and retired with an honorable discharge. (Item 3 at 14.) He noted he had not attended schools in the last ten years and had not received a degree or diploma going back more than ten years. In July 2016, after retiring from the military he became a boat driver for his sponsor. He was granted a Secret clearance while in the military. He currently does not hold a clearance. Applicant\u2019s fourteen delinquent debts total over $54,346. The debts are established by three credit reports, and his response to DOHA interrogatories. (Items 4- 7.) None of the debts are reflected on his SCA. (Item 3.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: past-due accounts charged-off for $14,309 and $13,390 respectively from the same lender. Applicant notes in his Answer that he was in the progress of resolving SOR \u00b6 1.a.

The April 2019 credit report shows the last activity was in 2018. (Item 6 at 2.) \nApplicant denied the debt and noted \u201cnever used this company\u201d in his SOR Answer. In \nhis response to interrogatories, he marked that the debt had been paid but no \ndocumentation of payment was submitted. (Item 7 at 4.) He also marked payment \narrangement had been made and he was making payments, but again marked no \ndocumentation of proof of payment was provided. (Item 7 at 4-5.) \nApplicant argues he has resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c by tax withholding. He also \nargues he is doing this during a move and an adoption. He provides no further explanation \nand provides no substantiating documentation showing any action he had taken to \nresolve or address his accounts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves an Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts, arising from a series of \ninvestment decisions. His admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The most recent credit report does not reflect \nmany of the debts which arose around his 2016 retirement. However, he provided no \nsubstantiating documentation showing any action to resolve or address his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant retired from the military and cites \nbeing unable to devote time due to a move and an adoption. His interrogatory responses \nshow he affirmatively marked the debts were paid but then did not provide documentation \nto support his interrogatory response. He does not support his Answer with substantiating \ndocumentation showing any action to resolve or address his debts or to show that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are not established. Applicant failed to provide evidence \nthat debts were paid, otherwise being resolved, or disputed. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant 63 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 1997. He married in 1983 and has an adult child. He has lived in the same \nhouse since 1999. He has been steadily employed since 2005, except in 2013 he was \nunemployed from March to May, and in 2015 he was unemployed from June to August. \nHe received $24,000 in severance pay after losing his job in 2013. He has been employed \nby his present employer since August 2015. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2015. In \nit he disclosed he failed to pay his 2013 federal income taxes due to \u201ctemporary financial \nhardship due to unemployment.\u201d He stated he owed the IRS $24,581. He said he \ncontacted the IRS to make arrangements. He also disclosed he failed to pay his 2014 \nstate income taxes due to \u201cfinancial hardship during work layoff\u201d but he paid the debt in \nSeptember 2015. (Item 3) \nIn February 2016, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He told \nthe investigator about his unemployment in 2015 and that he received a severance \npackage, and he did not have financial difficulties during this period but did have some \nwhen he was unemployed in 2013. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he also owed federal income taxes for tax years \n2012, 2013, and 2014. He was unable to pay them because he was earning less than he \nwas accustomed to. He said he contacted the IRS in August 2015 to establish a payment \nplan. He did not explain if an installment agreement was executed. He said he paid the \nIRS $200 a month starting in August 2015 but stopped paying in October 2015 because \nhe was paying other bills. He intended to resume the $200 payments. He told the \ninvestigator that he attributed his financial problems to changing jobs and being laid off in \n2010. His SCA reflects he was laid off in October 2010 and started a new job in November \n2010. He told the investigator he had no intention to fail to pay his taxes in the future. \n(Items 3, 4) \nThe investigator also discussed with Applicant his delinquent student loans. \nApplicant explained he had cosigned student loans for his daughter beginning in 2005 \nand they had been past due since about 2010. He could not pay them because he had a \nlower income. He had no idea when they went to collection. He said they were current in \n2014 and the initial balance owed of approximately $80,000 was reduced to $70,000. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant is indebted to his state higher education authority for an \naccount in collection in the approximate amount of $125,848.

The debt is reflected on his April 2021 credit report. (Items 4, 5) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax years \n2010 through 2018 in the amount of $47,263 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In March 2021, Applicant \nresponded to government interrogatories and provided tax transcripts from March 2021 \nand an IRS installment agreement summary from January 2021, which reflects the \nfollowing: \n2010-balance owed $2,320 \n2011-balance owed $13,450 \n2012-balance owed $3,001 \n2015-balance owed $3,179 \n2016-balance owed $10,188 \n2017-balance owed $4,249 \n2018-balance owed $10,873 \nApplicant only provided page 3 of the IRS installment agreement summary. He did \nnot provide any evidence of an approved installment agreement with the IRS or any \npayments made. In his March 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent \nfederal income tax debts and said \u201cI am working to negotiate a repayment plan. In the \nmeantime, I will make a payment on IRS website of at least $200 every 2 weeks.\u201d. (Items \n2, 4) \nThe March 2021 tax transcripts show Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income (AGI) for \nthe following tax years:  \nAGI for 2013-$77,327 \nAGI for 2014-$111,891 \nAGI for 2015-$128,195 \nAGI for 2016-$112,122 \nAGI for 2017-$100,321 \nAGI for 2018-$118,450 \nThe tax transcripts also show that there may have been installment agreements \nestablished over the years, but then they stopped. No explanation was provided, and it \ndid not appear that monthly payments were being made. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was indebted to his state for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $1,610 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

(Item 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent federal income taxes \nin the amount of $47,263 for tax years 2010 through 2012 and 2015 through 2018. He \ntold the government investigator in November 2015 that he owed federal income taxes \nfor tax year 2013 and was making payment arrangements. He said he had no intention \nof failing to pay his taxes in the future, yet he repeatedly did. He is indebted to his state \ntax authority in the approximate amount of $1,610. He is indebted to his state\u2019s higher \neducation authority for delinquent student loans in the approximate amount of $125,848. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant disclosed in his November 2015 SCA that he had not paid his 2013 \nfederal income taxes but was making arrangements with the IRS to pay them. The \nevidence supports that he has not paid his 2010 through 2012 and 2015 through 2018 \nfederal income taxes. He claimed he made $200 payments in 2015 but provided no \nsupporting proof. Despite being aware in 2015 that failure to pay one\u2019s taxes was a \nsecurity concern, he repeated the conduct in 2016, 2017, and 2018. There is some \nevidence he may have had installment agreements with the IRS, but no evidence he \nfulfilled those agreements. His January 2021 summary of an installment agreement from \nthe IRS, only shows what he owes for each tax year and not what he was required to pay \nmonthly. He provided no evidence that he executed that agreement or that he is making \nany payments. He said he paid his state tax debt but did not provide evidence to \nsubstantiate his claim. He said he was negotiating a payment plan to resolve the \ndelinquent student loans but did not provide evidence he has done so. His debts are \nongoing. There is no evidence of a good-faith effort to repay the delinquent debts. There \nis no evidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his debts to a change in his income after 2010. His SCA \nreflects he was employed steadily from 2010 until a period of unemployment from March \n2013 to May 2013 and June 2015 to August 2015. He did not provide evidence as to what \nhis AGI was in 2010, 2011 or 2012. However, according to his tax transcripts after 2013, \nhis AGI increased and consistently remained over $100,000. He also told the government \ninvestigator that he had received a $24,000 severance from his employer in 2015, and he \nhad no financial difficulties. Applicant\u2019s short periods of unemployment may have \nimpacted his income, but he failed to provide a reasonable explanation for why he \nrepeatedly failed to pay his federal income taxes. He told the investigator in November \n2015 that he did not intend to have future issues with paying his taxes. He said he was \nnegotiating a payment plan for the delinquent student loans. No evidence corroborating \nhis assertion was provided. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. Applicant has not acted \nresponsibly in paying his delinquent taxes and student loans. \nThe evidence is insufficient to conclude Applicant has made arrangements with \nthe appropriate tax authorities to pay the amount owed for his federal and state income \ntaxes. The incomplete IRS installment agreement from January 2021 only shows what he \nowes and not what the agreement is for or if it was ever executed. Also, in his answer to \nthe SOR, he indicated he was negotiating a payment plan with the IRS, and he was \nmaking $200 payments. He did not provide any evidence to support his statements. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the National Guard from December 2008 \nto January 2017. He deployed to Afghanistan for 12 months in 2011 and 2012. He \nreceived an honorable discharge. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He is not \nmarried. He has one child. Applicant testified he has been steadily employed with no \nperiods of unemployment. He has worked for his current employer since September 2018. \nHe stated he held a secret security clearance from 2009 and it was upgraded to a top \nsecret clearance in 2018. (Tr. 8, 17-20, GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR; statements to government investigators; hearing \ntestimony; and credit reports from May 2019, April 2020, May 2020, and February 2022 \ncorroborate the SOR allegations. \nIn 2015, while serving with the National Guard, Applicant was scheduled to deploy, \nbut due to a medical disqualification, he was unable. He was paid for the deployment \nanyway. In August 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \nwas confronted with the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($25,953) owed to the federal government for \nrepayment of the deployment pay he should not have received. He said he was advised \nof the overpayment in February 2016. He told the investigator that he was working two \njobs and planned to make payment arrangements to resolve the debt. He also said he \ndid not have any other delinquent accounts and his current finances were good. (Tr. 22-\n35; GE 6) \nIn July 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator. He \nacknowledged he owed the debt to the federal government for the overpayment as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He told the investigator that he was unable to make the payments \nto repay the debt. He said he was making more money and was going to look for \nadditional employment. He planned to contact the creditor in July 2020 and make \npayment arrangements. (GE 7) \nApplicant testified that after he received the overpayment, his first sergeant \nadvised him that he would have to repay the amount.

When he was discharged from \nthe military, he did not make arrangements to repay the amount owed. He testified that \nsometime in 2020, he received a letter in the mail from the federal creditor telling him he \nhad to pay the debt. He then set up an automatic payment of $500 a month to repay the \ndebt. Applicant testified that he kept the overpayment in a designated account and could \npay most of the debt. He admitted he used about $1,000 of the money for his personal \nexpenses. When questioned why if he had the overpayment money in his personal \naccount, he said he did not have it to pay it all back. He said he did not know. He said he \ncurrently had about $12,500 of the overpayment in his account and could pay that amount \nimmediately. It is unknown what he spent the balance of the overpayment on, but it was \nnot readily available in his account. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 22-\n35) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided a document dated April 5, 2022, from a third-\nparty collector for the Department of the Treasury. It reflected an agreement with \nApplicant from December 2020 to pay $494 a month. He provided proof that he has made \npayments from May 2022 until March 2023. The balance owed in April 2022 was $22,162, \nwhich includes penalties and costs. On April 14, 2023, after his hearing, he made a \n$10,000 payment toward the debt. He did not provide evidence if he made any payments \nin accordance with the agreement prior to May 2022. (AE A, B) \nApplicant attended college full time from 2009 until he graduated in May 2017. He \nused his military educational benefits and student loans to fund his education. His \ndefaulted student loans, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h and 1.j-1.l total approximately \n$63,115. In July 2020 when questioned by a government investigator, Applicant \nacknowledged all of his delinquent student loans and told the investigator that he planned \non contacting the creditor that day to discuss options for getting the debts out of collection \nand paid. He testified that he never followed up on contacting the creditor. He said that \nthe creditor never contacted him about repaying the debts, so he did not make any \npayments. He said if he does not receive a bill, he does not know how to pay the debt. \nHe said he pays all of his expenses through automatic withdrawals. He said now that he \nknows how to pay the debts, he will. (Tr. 36-38, 57-59; GE 2, 3 ,4 5, 7) \nIn July 2020, Applicant was confronted by the government investigator with a debt \nowed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (SOR \u00b6 1.m $1,488) He told the \ninvestigator this was a loan for education. He stopped attending class and received an \nincomplete, which resulted in an overpayment to him. He said he was paying the debt \nthrough monthly installments, but then he had to start child support payments. He planned \nto contact the VA in July 2020 to set up payment arrangements to pay the debt in full. He \ntestified that he did not make arrangements to pay this debt. (Tr. 42-44; GE 7) \nSOR \u00b61.i alleged child support arrearages of $4,283. Applicant testified that he \nhad his child support payments automatically withdrawn from his paycheck.

It states the non-custodial parent\u2019s \norder balances and specifically states that it is not an official document and may not be \ncomplete regarding information about child support. It appears there is a balance owed \nof $1,427. Applicant did not provide any specific information about the current balance \nowed. (Tr. 39-42; AE E) \nApplicant testified that he was unable to pay his debts because two years ago his \nmother developed medical problems and he has been helping her financially. He gives \nher about $200 a month to help pay for medication and also occasionally he helps with \nother unexpected expenses. He bought her a washer and dryer that cost about $600 \nabout six months ago. (Tr. 21, 38, 48-50, 61) \nApplicant testified that his annual income is approximately $70,000. He has about \n$1,800 of expendable monthly income. He will no longer be required to pay child support \nin June 2023, when his son reaches majority. Applicant has approximately $11,500 in his \nchecking and savings account. He works as a driver for three different rideshare \ncompanies and depending on how much he works he could make an additional $300 a \nmonth. He testified that he intends to start paying all of his debts, he just needs more \ntime. (Tr. 17, 21, 46-48-50; AE G) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in March 2018. \nQuestions under Section 26, regarding his finances, asked if he was currently delinquent \non any Federal debt, and he responded \u201cno.\u201d He did not disclose his debts to the federal \ngovernment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for an overpayment, \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h and 1.j through \n1.l for student loans, or his VA debt in \u00b6 1.m. Applicant\u2019s explanation was that he did not \nunderstand the question. He was aware since February 2016 that he owed a debt to the \nfederal government for his overpayment made for the deployment he did not take. I did \nnot believe he misunderstood that he had to disclose this debt. I find Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a owed to the federal government. (Tr. 45, 52-58; \nGE 1) \nIt is unclear that since Applicant graduated from college in May 2017 if his student \nloans would have been due to be paid or delinquent when he completed his SCA in March \n2018. I have insufficient evidence to conclude he deliberately failed to disclose that his \nstudent loans and VA loan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.h and 1.j - 1.m) were delinquent when he \ncompleted his 2018 SCA. \nApplicant completed another SCA in January 2020. Questions under Section 26, \nregarding his finances, asked if he was currently delinquent on any Federal debt, and he \nresponded \u201cno.\u201d It also asked if in the last seven years if he had been delinquent on \nalimony or child support. He responded \u201cno.\u201d Applicant testified that when he completed \nthe January 2020 SCA, he did not know it was an SCA. He believed it was an application \nfor some other job with his company.

I find he intentionally failed to disclose these \ndebts were delinquent. (Tr. 45; GE 8) \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was paying the mother of his child directly \nfor child support and it was not being accounted for by the state. I find he did not \nintentionally fail to disclose his child support issue on his January 2020 SCA. There is \ninsufficient evidence regarding whether he was aware he was delinquent on his child \nsupport payments. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has been aware that he received an overpayment by the government for \nunearned deployment pay since at least 2016. He graduated from college in 2017 and \nhas not made payments towards his student loans, which were delinquent. He dropped \na class that was paid for by the VA and has failed to pay the debt associated with it. \nDespite stating he had the money to repay the overpayment, he failed to do so and used \nsome of it for his personal expenses. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant testified that he had the money to reimburse the government for the \noverpayment, but he did not. He has been on notice about this debt since 2016 and it was \naddressed by the government investigator with him in July 2020. It appears he made a \npayment arrangement in December 2020 but he only provided proof of monthly payments \nthat began in March 2022, after receipt of his SOR. Despite saying he had the \noverpayment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in an account, he did not offer an explanation for why he was \nnot able to repay the entire amount immediately. He made a lump-sum payment of \n$10,000 after his hearing. He did not provide evidence that he has made payment \narrangements for his student loans or to repay the VA loan. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent \nand ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to helping his mother with some of her \nexpenses in the past two years. He did not offer other explanations for his failure to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddress his delinquent debts, either before then, or since. Although this support may have \nhad some impact recently on his finances, no explanations were offered for why he has \nnot addressed the debts before then. There is insufficient evidence that his financial \nproblems were beyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant participated in financial counseling or that there \nare clear indications his financial problems are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nThere is some evidence that after receiving the SOR, Applicant made payments \ntoward the overpayment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is concern that this is money that he \nsaid he had in an account, but clearly he spent some of it. That does not show a good-\nfaith effort to repay the overdue creditor. However, he is given some credit for reducing \nthe amount he owes, but it is insufficient to mitigate his previous conduct. AG \u00b6 20(d) has \nminimal application to this debt. He did not provide evidence of payments towards his \nother delinquent debts. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant failed to disclose on his March 2018 SCA his \noverpayment debt to the government, delinquent federal student loans, and his VA loan. \nSubstantial evidence supports that he was aware of the overpayment debt and \nintentionally failed to disclose it. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that at that \npoint his student loans and VA loan were delinquent. I also find that there is insufficient \nevidence to conclude he was aware that his child support was delinquent.

I find he intentionally failed to disclose the overpayment debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleged that in his 2020 SCA, Applicant failed to disclose all of the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m. I found that he was aware of the \noverpayment debts, student loans, and VA debt in 2020 and intentionally failed to disclose \nthem. There is insufficient evidence he failed to disclose the child support debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i, and I find for him on that specific allegation. \nI did not find Applicant credible in his explanation for why he failed to disclose his \nother delinquent debts. He was on notice since 2016 regarding the overpayment and had \nnot made any payments on his student loans. He was aware he was responsible for \nrepaying the VA for the class he dropped. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, The following are \npotentially applicable to the disqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment \nApplicant did not make a prompt or good-faith effort to correct the omission. Failure \nto disclose required information on an SCA is not a minor offense. There is insufficient \nevidence that it happened under unique circumstances, and it is noted that it occurred on \na 2018 and again on a 2020 SCA. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, good \njudgment, and trustworthiness. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.m) \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for SOR \u00b6 1.i) \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Tr. 21-22; GE 1) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent consumer and \nmedical debts totaling approximately $38,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f). These delinquencies \nconsist of a medical account, credit-card accounts, auto loans, and a personal loan. The \nGovernment also alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for the 2015 through 2018 tax years, despite being required to do so (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h). Finally, it alleged that he owed delinquent federal income taxes in the \napproximate amount of $13,450 for the 2015 through 2018 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.i). In his \nAnswer and Answer to Amendment, he admitted all of the SOR allegations with \nadditional comment. I have adopted his admissions as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer; \nAnswer to Amendment) \nThe delinquent medical account for $244 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been \nresolved. This account became delinquent in approximately May 2017. Applicant \nclaimed that he contacted the creditor about this debt and paid it over the phone \napproximately a year ago. He contacted the creditor after the SOR was issued. He did \nnot provide corroborating documentation regarding this payment. (Tr. 32-38, 41, 77; \nAnswer; GE 1-4) \nThe delinquent online credit card for $490 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b has been resolved. \nApplicant opened this account in August 2019, but fell behind on payments in 2020 \nbecause he had other expenses to cover. In approximately March 2021, he contacted \nthe creditor and paid approximately $456 to settle the account for less than the full \nbalance. (Tr. 41-42; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe auto loan delinquent for $746 with a total balance of approximately $12,861 \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about August \n2015 for the purchase of a used vehicle. He became delinquent on the account in about \nNovember 2020 because he did not have enough income to make the payments on it. \nIn approximately November 2021, his wife contacted the creditor and paid about $6,000 \nto settle the account for less than the full balance. (Tr. 41-45, 72-74; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent auto loan for $29,101 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d has not been resolved. \nApplicant opened this account in about August 2016 for the purchase of a used vehicle. \nHe fell behind on payments on this account in about September or October 2020 \nbecause he did not have enough income to pay all of his financial obligations and the \naccount was charged off. In approximately November 2021, either he or his wife \ncontacted the creditor about this debt and the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c.

(Tr. 45-49, 73-75; Answer; GE 1-4) \nThe credit-card account delinquent for $105 with a total balance of approximately \n$3,719 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e has been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about \n2008. He has had periods of time when he has been delinquent on the account because \nof a lack of sufficient funds to pay all of his financial obligations, but manages to catch \nback up. The account has been current since about November 2021. The status of this \naccount is corroborated by credit reports (Tr. 49-50; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent personal loan for $4,880 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f has not been \nresolved. Applicant opened this account in about August 2015 to pay for daily living \nexpenses. The creditor charged off the account in about 2016 when Applicant stopped \nmaking payments on it. Applicant claimed that he contacted the creditor about this \naccount in 2018, although he also testified that he did not contact any of the creditors in \nthe SOR until after the SOR was issued in December 2020. Applicant claimed that the \ncreditor acknowledged that the account was \u201coff their books,\u201d so he did not make any \npayment arrangements or payments on this account. (Tr. 41, 50-53; Answer; GE 1-2) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the 2015 \nthrough 2018 tax years, despite being required to do so. He filed all of these late income \ntax returns in August 2022. He filed his federal and state income tax returns for the \n2019 through 2021 tax years in August 2022. He provided no evidence that he had an \nextension from the IRS or his state tax authority to file any of these income tax returns \nbeyond the deadline. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as \nApplicant\u2019s late filing of income tax returns for tax years other than 2015 through 2018 \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the \napplication of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 17-18, 23-28, \n41, 78-79; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant claimed that he failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns in 2015 because he completed the forms and realized that he owed about \n$10,000 in federal taxes. He knew he could not afford to pay that amount, so he \nprocrastinated. He wanted to wait to formulate a plan and to save money, so he did not \nfile. He claimed that prior to 2015, he had always received an income tax refund, but \nbelieved that his retirement from the military must have changed his tax status. A similar \nthought process resulted in his not timely filing his federal and state income tax returns \nfor the 2016 through 2021 tax years. He was worried about not being able to pay his \nfederal taxes, so he procrastinated and avoided filing so as not to draw the attention of \nthe IRS. (Tr. 17-18, 23-29, 41, 78-79; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant owed about $13,450 in delinquent federal taxes for the 2015 through \n2018 tax years. He believed that after the IRS finished calculating his balance after \nreceiving his 2015 through 2021 income tax returns, he would ultimately owe about \n$10,000. He provided no documentary evidence to corroborate that he will owe this \nlesser amount. There is no evidence in the record that he owed any state income taxes. \nHe claimed that he included a form with his late federal income tax filings requesting the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIRS enter into a payment plan with him. He did not provide a copy of this form. He did \nnot request a specific amount to pay to the IRS, but believed that he can pay about \n$1,200 per month. His plan is to wait for the IRS to get back to him about his payment \narrangement request and then make the required payments. (Tr. 17-18, 23-29, 58, 78-\n80; Answer; Answer to Amendment; GE 1)  \nApplicant claimed his financial problems with respect to his consumer and \nmedical debts were attributable to several causes. In 2016, he and his family had to \nmove on short notice because their landlord was not paying the mortgage on their \nresidence and the property was foreclosed upon. This foreclosure resulted in Applicant \nmoving twice in about a year. The difficulty and expense of his moves were exacerbated \nby his need to accommodate a large family and a number of farm animals. His resultant \nrent of $2,300 per month for his current residence was relatively high for the area. He \nhas operated a working dairy farm that loses a significant amount of money. His wife \nwas a stay-at-home mother until 2020 and then was in and out of work until October \n2022. Finally, he blames inflation for his rising costs. Given his inability to pay his \nfinancial obligations, he has not presented sufficient evidence to show that he has \nenough income to cover his expenses. (Tr. 14, 29-31, 65-66, 71, 75-76) \nApplicant has earned about $140,000 annually in salary since about 2015. He \nhas also received about $4,300 per month in military retirement. Applicant\u2019s wife has \ncontributed to the family income when she has been employed. She worked for about \nsix months in 2020, and then was unemployed until about August 2021. She was \nemployed again beginning in August 2021 for about six months. From then until October \n2022, she was either unemployed or worked part time for a friend. As of October 2022, \nshe started a new job and has earned about $1,000 to $1,200 every other week. \nApplicant claimed that now that his wife has income, he is able to save some money. \nHe claimed that he is also cutting back on the expenses of his farm, but did not explain \nhow he is doing so. (Tr. 15, 21-22, 65-66) \nApplicant\u2019s regular monthly expenses are the aforementioned $2,300 in rent, \n$300 to $500 per month for electricity, about $1,000 a few times per year for propane, \n$2,500 per month for animal feed, $100 per month for veterinary bills, and about $400 \nper month for cell phones. He also spends about $1,200 to $1,400 per month on \ngroceries. He has about $400 in his checking account and no money in savings. He has \nabout $10,000 to $11,000 in a retirement account.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has had financial issues for at least seven years. He has had several \ndelinquent consumer and medical debts. Beginning in 2015, he did not timely file \nmultiple years of federal and state income tax returns, despite being required to do so. \nHe has owed approximately $13,450 in delinquent federal taxes for several years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhile Applicant has provided evidence that he has resolved three of the six \nconsumer and medical SOR debts through payments, and he has filed his delinquent \nincome tax returns, he has not provided sufficient evidence that the remaining debts are \nbeing resolved in a meaningful way. He has significant unaddressed consumer debt and \ndelinquent federal taxes. As he does not know the amount the IRS will require in \npayment arrangements, he has not presented sufficient evidence to show he will be \nable to afford them. His financial issues are ongoing and I cannot find they are unlikely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s consumer and medical delinquencies arose, at least partially, \nbecause of unforeseen moves, his wife\u2019s unemployment, and inflation. These conditions \nwere beyond his control. To avail himself of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also \nshow that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to his delinquent \nconsumer and medical debts. While he has settled some of his SOR debts through \npayment, he did so after having received the SOR. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). He still has three unaddressed consumer and medical debts \ncombined. With respect to the medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, there is no \ndocumentation in the record to corroborate the payment of this debt. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nGiven the timing of the resolution of his satisfied debts and the amount of his still \nunresolved delinquent consumer and medical debt, I cannot find that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with respect to that debt. Moreover, his failure to \nwithhold sufficient wages to offset his federal tax obligations and his failure to timely file \nhis federal and state income tax returns were not due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant sought and received financial counseling in 2016 or 2017, many \nof his financial delinquencies arose after he received it. Given the amount of his still \nunresolved delinquent debt, he has not provided sufficient evidence that his financial \nissues are being resolved or are under control.

With respect to the debts that he has \npaid, he began to address those delinquent debts after the SOR was issued and \ntherefore failed to show that his effort to resolve those debts was made in good faith. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has now filed his outstanding federal and state income tax \nreturns, he still owes delinquent federal taxes. Moreover, his late filing of his delinquent \nincome tax returns does not end the mitigation analysis. He must also show reform and \nrehabilitation with respect to his income tax return filing. He has not provided sufficient \nevidence of reform and rehabilitation, as he has yet to file a timely income tax return \nsince 2014. He does not have an arrangement in place with the IRS to repay them. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nNone of the mitigating conditions applies. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy military service, and I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

(Tr. at 61 and \nGX-3 at 17.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to timely file, as required, a Federal income tax return for \ntax year 2019. Applicant testified her untimely filing of her taxes was an isolated incident \nand at the time she was going through a lot. Her uncle, who had served as her father \nfigure, had passed away in December 2019. She was \u201chandling his matters because [she] \nwas his power of attorney with his medical and helping out the family with doing a lot of \nthings that he asked [her] to do prior to him passing.\u201d (Tr. at 50-51.) She testified she \nmailed her tax returns in August 2020. She considered her 2019 taxes filed when she put \nthe return in the mail. She explained that, when she received a refund, she considered \nthe issue resolved, not realizing that the refund she received was for her state return. \n(AX-F.) She testified that she called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to verify that they \nhad processed her tax return. The IRS had no record of her return, and she was instructed \nto fax the tax return in, which she did on July 30, 2021. (Tr. at 20.) After waiting a week, \nApplicant testified she contacted the IRS again, and the IRS informed her they still had \nnot received her return. She faxed the return again on August 19, 2021. (Tr. at 20 and \nAX-H.) She waited another week, and the IRS still had not received the tax return. She \nmade an appointment and delivered the tax return in person.

She took \nout student loans again each time she reenrolled after life events in 1991, 1997, and 2000 \nrequired her to stop her schooling. She was able to get her student loans either deferred \nor placed in forbearance in each situation. She understood that the loans were still \naccruing interest. (Tr. at 27.) \nWhen Applicant reenrolled in 1997 as a part-time student, most of her course work \ndid not transfer, and she was forced to start over. Her student loans remained in a \nforbearance or a non-payment status during this time. She chose not to make any \nvoluntary payments, citing her other expenses as a single parent. (Tr. at 32-33.) She \nremained a part-time student until 2000. She withdrew from school during finals when the \nmother died in the spring of 2000. She did not return and estimates she is two classes \nshort of her degree. \nApplicant testified she was notified she had received the maximum number of \ndeferments or forbearance and that she needed to work out a payment plan to avoid the \nloan going into default. (Tr. at 56.) She worked with the Student Loan Rehabilitation \nDepartment to set up a payment plan and work with them. The payment plan was \napproved on July 1, 2019. Her first payment was due until October 2019, and after five \npayments the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act passed. She \nhad her payments suspended and her student loans placed in administrative forbearance. \nHer monthly payments will pick back up once the administrative forbearance is lifted. (Tr. \nat 21.) She supported her testimony with documentary evidence. (AX-E, AX-F, and AX-\nG.)  \nApplicant fell behind on her mortgage payments in 2013 after she was hospitalized \nand needed emergency surgery. Given her new employment status, she did not receive \nfull pay and only a percentage of the surgery was covered by insurance. She \u201chad to pick \nand choose what could be paid,\u201d but she entered into a refinancing program and brought \n\u201ceverything current going forward.\u201d (Tr. 40 and AX-D.) She received a congratulatory letter \nin March 2021 from her mortgage holder, acknowledging her six years of good standing \nand that she had earned financial incentives that would be applied to the principle. (AX- \nD.)  \nApplicant estimates she has about $50,000 in credit card debt. She supports her \ndaughter and her brother, who also lives with her. (Tr. at 60, 68.) After paying all her \nstanding expenses (mortgage, car, groceries, clothing, food, gym membership, etc), and \nadding her student loan payments, she estimates she has approximately $300 left over. \n(Tr. at 63.)

In Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to the SOR she denied the allegation on the basis her student loan was reported \ncurrent and that she had confirmed that information with the Department of Education. \nShe wrote in Answer: \u201cAt the time of my response, I correctly answered no. My student \nloan was being reported as current and I confirmed that information with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education National Payment center.\u201d She wrote in her interrogatory \nresponse that she had been approved for a student loan rehabilitation with a $200 monthly \npayment. (GX-4 at 6.) She testified the only thing she could think was that she got \ndistracted and did not think about everything that needed to be done during that process. \n(Tr. at 52.) At the time she completed her security clearance application she was \nstruggling to get herself together. Her uncle, with whom she was close, died in December \n2019. (Tr. 51-52 and AX-I.) When she submitted her security application, she listed \nvarious debts related to credit cards, medical bills, and her mortgage. (GX-3 at 30-34.) \nApplicant provided two letters attesting to her character and trustworthiness. The \nfirst is from a personal acquaintance that she has known over 20 years, and the second\nis from a supervisor that she has known for over six years. (Tr. at 22 and AX-B and AX-\nC.) \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant's tax delinquency was a onetime occurrence \nthat occurred after her uncle\u2019s death, making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant's failure to timely file her Federal tax returns \nwas not the result of her financial mismanagement or a conscious decision on her part to \nnot file her 2019 Federal tax return. For her student loans, she has applied for and \nreceived deferment or forbearance on her student loans. When she reached the \nmaximum number of deferments, she negotiated a monthly payment amount on her \nstudent loans that she demonstrated she can meet. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant provided documentary evidence to support \nher credible testimony that she followed the IRS\u2019s direction when the return could still not \nbe located.   \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that her finances no longer \ngenerate questions about her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information on her January 2020 \nsecurity clearance application. She supported her Answer with documentary evidence. \nHer testimony added additional detail for why she mistakenly put only certain debts on \nher application. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. No other disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns and refuted the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n         Subparagraphs 1.a-c: \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n                    Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 31, has worked for a federal contracting company since November 2018. He served in the Marine Corps from June 2009 to February 2017, as an infantryman, and was honorably discharged. He deployed twice on combat tours. He was initially granted access to classified information while on active duty. He completed a security clearance application in August 2019 and reported some derogatory financial information. The ensuing investigation discovered Applicant had substantial delinquent debt. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $36,977 on 11 delinquent accounts. (GE 1- 5; Tr. 36-37, 38) Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in April 2018 after he was fired for fighting with another employee. He was unemployed for seven months. As a result, his household income decreased from $53,000 to $39,000. To make ends meet, he used 2 personal loans and credit cards to pay his living expenses. He did so knowing that he had no means of repaying the debt as he incurred it. (GE 1-2; Tr. 39-40, 41) In Applicant\u2019s current position, he earns approximately $63,600 annually after taxes. His wife\u2019s income has also increased, and their household income is now $110,600. He began working on the resolution of his delinquent debts in April 2021, using the proceeds from an employee referral bonus to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($3,096), 1.j ($721), 1.k ($2,338), and one non-SOR debt for $1,272.

DOHA received the transcript on March 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 31, has worked for a federal contracting company since November \n2018. He served in the Marine Corps from June 2009 to February 2017, as an \ninfantryman, and was honorably discharged. He deployed twice on combat tours. He \nwas initially granted access to classified information while on active duty. He completed \na security clearance application in August 2019 and reported some derogatory financial \ninformation. The ensuing investigation discovered Applicant had substantial delinquent \ndebt. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $36,977 on 11 delinquent accounts. (GE 1-\n5; Tr. 36-37, 38) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in April 2018 after he was fired for fighting \nwith another employee. He was unemployed for seven months. As a result, his \nhousehold income decreased from $53,000 to $39,000.

His wife\u2019s income has also increased, and their household income is now\n$110,600. He began working on the resolution of his delinquent debts in April 2021,\nusing the proceeds from an employee referral bonus to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d ($3,096), 1.j ($721), 1.k ($2,338), and one non-SOR debt for $1,272. (This non-SOR\ndebt is the same amount as the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Though it has not been\nestablished by the record, it is possible it is the same debt). He also set up an\ninstallment agreement for a 2020 tax liability. He has made timely payments since\nAugust 2021. (GE 5; AE J; Tr. 44-45, 50, 52-53, 62, 64-65)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn January 2022, Applicant received a 100% disability rating from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. As a result, he began receiving $3,400 per month in disability \nbenefits. He has used the extra income to reduce his living expenses, pay unexpected \nexpenses in March 2022, and resolve his delinquent accounts. In April 2022, he paid \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($789). In May 2022 he paid another non-SOR debt for $3,000. (AE I) After \nthe hearing, Applicant established payment agreements for the accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i. He paid off the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, \nand 1.i according to the payment plans. He has not yet made plans regarding the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,272). (Tr. 38, 40, 44, 51, 57, 62-63; AE B-F, H, J) \nApplicant\u2019s government client\u2019s representative testified at the hearing. He knows \nApplicant personally and professionally. The witness testified that Applicant\u2019s position \nhas a large financial component. He is responsible for handling hundreds of financial \nmechanisms for the command he supports that value upwards of six million dollars. He \nis often required to handle large sums of cash. He has managed these responsibilities \nwithout issue. The witness is aware of the security clearance concerns related to \nApplicant\u2019s finances and has no concerns about Applicant performing the financial tasks \nrelated to his job. (Tr. 25-33) \nApplicant\u2019s second-level supervisor also testified. He has a personal and \nprofessional relationship with Applicant. He is aware of the financial concerns related to \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. Applicant has discussed with him his strategy for \nresolving his debt. His supervisor believes that Applicant lives within his means. He \ntestified that Applicant has not exhibited any behaviors that raises concerns about how \nhe manages his personal finances. (Tr. 18-24) \nApplicant attributes a lot of his financial problems to a lack of knowledge. At the \nhearing, he testified that upon separating from the military at age 27, he only knew how \nto be an infantryman. He admitted that he is still learning how to manage his finances. \nHe and his wife, who welcomed their first child together in August 2022, have developed \na written budget. They have adjusted their expenses to ensure that they are not \noverspending. Going forward, Applicant intends to use his disability benefits to resolve \nhis remaining delinquent accounts. He is paying the smaller accounts first and then \nmoving on to larger accounts that require payment plans.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the financial considerations \nguideline. Applicant\u2019s admissions as well as the documents in the record support the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case. \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant admits to owing $46,977 on 11 delinquent \ndebts. He also admits knowingly incurring debt without the means to repay it. The \nrecord supports the application of the following financial considerations disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant \nincurred \ndelinquent \ndebt \nduring \na \nseven-month \nperiod \nof \nunemployment. The events causing his unemployment were not beyond his control. He \nengaged in workplace misconduct that resulted in his termination. However, while in his \ncurrent position, he has demonstrated a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. He has \nused the extra income he has received since April 2021 to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. He has resolved over $4,000 in non-SOR debts, and seven SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i. 1.j, 1.k), totaling $11,933. While some of the SOR debts remain \nunresolved, his promises to pay them are credible. Applicant has demonstrated action \nconsistent with his stated strategy of using his extra income to resolve his debt. \nApplicant also presented sufficient information to establish that his financial problems \ndid not affect his ability to handle the financial components of his position. His \nperformance, as corroborated by his government client representative, does not cast \ndoubt on his ongoing security worthiness. The record supports a finding that he has \npresented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial concerns. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Applicant has demonstrated considerable \ngrowth and maturity since his separation from the military. He is taking the necessary \nsteps to rehabilitate his finances and develop better financial habits. He has \ndemonstrated that he possesses the self-control and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations, necessary for those granted access to classified information in performance \nof the financial tasks related to his job. A fair and commonsense assessment of the \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised \nunder the financial considerations guideline are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.
