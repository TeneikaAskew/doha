Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On January 28, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 19, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which he contends showed that his\nfinancial problems arose from circumstances that were beyond his control, and that he has now paid\noff, or arranged to pay off, all his outstanding debts.  Applicant also argues that a trustworthiness\ndetermination based on his personal credit history is not indicative of his ability to maintain\nconfidentiality of sensitive information.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred. \nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-\n16376 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2007).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant\nactually mishandles or fails to properly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke\naccess to such information.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).\nTrustworthiness determinations are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance\nor conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's\ntrustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\ntrustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 supra at 2.  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\ntrustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. Id.\nIn this case, the Judge based his adverse findings, in substantial part, on the fact that\nApplicant \u201cdid not provide any documentation\u201d that he had paid off, or was making payments on,\na number of the specific debts listed in the SOR.  Decision at 3.  He also noted that \u201cApplicant did\nnot provide any good character evidence\u201d  Id. at 4.  As a result, the Judge concluded that Applicant\nhad not \u201csatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.\u201d  Id. at 6.  The Board has previously noted that\nit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of\nindividual debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008); ISCR Case No.\n06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating\n\n3\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at\n2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nor an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  The Judge weighed the limited mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant with respect to two of the SOR\nfactual allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n1 \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant had previously submitted an SF 85P dated April 4, 2006 and a Declaration for Federal \nEmployment on April 4, 2006. GE 1, GE 2. \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 4, 2008.  He answered \nthe SOR in writing on March 20, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on March 24, 2008. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on May 14, 2008, and I received the case \nassignment on May 21, 2008.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 29, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on June 23, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9, which were received without objection, with the exception of GE 9. Applicant \nobjected to GE 9 being admitted on the grounds that it was not provided to him in a \ntimely manner. After argument by both parties, I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection. Tr. 12-\n14. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 30, 2008.  \n \nAlthough Applicant did not request to keep the record open, he submitted a letter \nhe prepared dated July 18, 2008, and marked AE B. In AE B, Applicant states he has \ncontacted every debtor on his credit report, and negotiated payment arrangements with \nthree of his creditors. He also requested that I delay my decision for six months to \nprovide him additional time to address his credit problems. Department Counsel \nforwarded AE B by Government\u2019s Reply to Post-Hearing Submission Offered by \nApplicant (Ex. II) dated July 21, 2008. Department Counsel objected to the admission of \nAE B on the grounds that it was not timely submitted and he was deprived of the \nopportunity to cross-examine the Applicant or rebut the information presented. After \nconsidering the matter, I admitted AE B. However, I will not delay issuing my decision \nfurther especially in light of the fact that Applicant has been aware of the Government\u2019s \nconcerns since at least October 2007 when he completed and submitted his Response \nto DOHA Interrogatory, discussed infra. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 20, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \u2013 1.e., 1.g., 1.i. \u2013 1.k., and 1.m. \u2013 1.n. of the SOR. He denied the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.b., 1.f., 1.h., and 1.l. of the SOR. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior information assurance engineer, who has \nworked for his defense contractor employer since April 2006. GE 3, Tr. 24, 56. He seeks \naccess to sensitive information in conjunction with a public trust position, which is a \ncondition of his employment. Tr. 25. \n \n \nHe was awarded an associates degree in general studies from a community \ncollege in August 2003. GE 1, Tr. 23. Applicant was married in March 1996. He and his \nwife have three daughters, ages 11, 9, and 5. Applicant and his wife have been \nseparated since April 2006, and have a divorce pending. GE 1, p. 5, AE A, Tr. 23, 25, \n56. \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his April 2006 and May 2006 SF 85Ps, April 2006 Declaration for \nFederal Employment, October 2007 Response to DOHA Interrogatory, and April 2006, \nJuly 2006, June 2007, December 2007, and June 2008 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 9. \n \nThe Government alleged in the SOR and established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand/or evidence presented that Applicant has/had 14 delinquent debts totaling $24,954. \nThe debts consist of ten collection accounts, three charged off accounts, and one \njudgment. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness began in 2002/2003 and has been ongoing. \nResponse to SOR, GE 4 \u2013 9, Tr. 54. \n \nApplicant has paid/resolved the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.b. He disputes \nthe debt itemized in SOR \u00b6 1.f., which is a $248 collection account owed to a cable \ncompany. He claimed that he returned the cable box after he moved and was not given \ncredit by the cable company. He did not provide any documentation. Tr. 33-35. He \ndisputes the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h., which is a $1,095 charged off account owed to a \ntelephone company. He claimed he settled this account and paid a lesser amount. He \ndid not provide any documentation. Tr. 39-41. With regard to $1,831 collection account \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.j., he stated he \u201cbelieve[s] [he] made two payments to fulfill that debt \nat a charge-off amount\u201d in November 2007. He did not provide any documentation. Tr. \n42-44. With regard to the $1,931 charged off account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l., he stated this \ndebt was contained in the $8,679 collection account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He did not \nprovide any documentation to support this contention. Tr. 45-46, 31-46. \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant responded to DOHA Interrogatories which queried \nhim about the debts alleged in the SOR. His responses varied, but made the point that \nhe was in the process of resolving each and every debt and that documentation would \nbe forthcoming. Apart from the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., there is no \ndocumentation in the record substantiating any of the other debts alleged have been \npaid/resolved. The documentation that indicates these two debts have been paid is \ncontained in Applicant\u2019s June 2008 credit report, GE 9.  \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a letter, which stated he had negotiated \npayment arrangements with three of his creditors. He did not provide any \ndocumentation from these creditors. AE B. \n \nApplicant stated before his separation, his wife was responsible for paying the \nbills and failed to do so. He acknowledged that he should have been more diligent in \nensuring the family finances were handled in a responsible manner. He also stated his \ndivorce is not final and that the responsibility of the marital debt has yet to be \ndetermined. Tr. 15-16. Applicant was unemployed from November 2002 to December \n2002. Tr. 37. He added: \n \nYou know, to be perfectly honest with you, I have not handled my debt \npretty well, as it clearly indicates here through my credit history. However \nit is my intention to give this more credence than I have in the past. Tr. 51. \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant stated he has $1,500 remaining per month after paying all his bills. In \nresponse to Department Counsel\u2019s query why he had not used that money to pay his \ndebt, Applicant answered, \u201cI just haven\u2019t done it.\u201d Tr. 54. Applicant did not provide any \ngood character evidence. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent accounts, \ntotaling $24,954, that were charged off as bad debts, submitted for collections, and/or \nresulted in a judgment being entered against him. His indebtedness began in 2003/2003 \nand has been ongoing. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant claims his \nindebtedness stems from his wife not paying the family bills, a separation and pending \ndivorce, and a brief period of unemployment. Two potential mitigating conditions apply \nunder this concern. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, \nApplicant has been separated since April 2006, and his indebtedness began in \n\n6 \n \n2003/2003. His divorce is pending. Applicant\u2019s unemployment spanned only a two-\nmonth period from November 2002 to December 2002. While going through a divorce is \noftentimes costly and traumatic, I note Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent. \nEven if Applicant\u2019s wife had not fulfilled her obligation to pay the family bills, Applicant \nfailed in his responsibility to exercise greater care in overseeing the family budget. \nParticularly troubling is the fact that Applicant claims he currently has a net monthly \nremainder of $1,500 after his bills are paid, yet these is no documented effort that he \nhas paid/resolved his outstanding debts. Applicant has failed to show that his separation \nand pending divorce has hindered him in addressing his outstanding debts. Similarly, \nthe length of time that has elapsed since his two-month unemployment in 2002 does not \nprovide a persuasive explanation for his indebtedness. \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Other than \ndocumenting payment of two debts through GE 9, Applicant has fallen short on showing \nthat he has paid or otherwise resolved the remaining debts. Applicant was quite clear in \nhis October 2007 Response to DOHA Interrogatory that he was going to resolve his \ndebts and provide documentation. Hence his post-hearing July 18, 2008 letter \nunaccompanied by documentation that he is \u201cworking and will continue to work diligently \nwith [his] credit counseling to payoff [his] debt\u201d rings hollow.

Green, Esquire\nApril 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 27, 2005.\nOn October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 28, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 13, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 6, 2008, in\nSan Diego, California. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and two additional witnesses testified on\nbehalf of Applicant. Applicant also submitted Exhibits A through SS. All of the exhibits\nwere admitted without objection, with the exception of Exhibits A and B,which were not\nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on March 14, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied every SOR allegation, although clearly Applicant\u2019s\nresponses did not actually address the allegations. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the two\nwitnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 42 years old. He is currently married to his third wife, and he has five\nchildren. He received a Masters Degree in Computer Science in 1997. Applicant served\nin the United States Army for 20 years \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 16 allegations regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,475. Applicant\ntestified that he has referred a number of debts to a law firm that acts as a credit\ncounseling service, and that he is planning to start using the firm to pay off his debts.\nThe company is listed in an enrollment summary page (Ex Y) as \u201ca national law firm\ndedicated to consumer debt resolution,\u201d (law firm) and it confirms that Applicant will pay\n$445.50 a month, through the debiting of his checking account, beginning on April 4,\n2008, and continuing for two years and six months, to pay off many of his outstanding\ndebts.  While no payment has yet been made on this debt, Applicant has now put in\nplace a plan to resolve this debt.  \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,191. Applicant\ntestified that he had made a payment of settlement on this debt. Ex MM is a copy of a\nsettlement letter on this debt, and Ex LL is a receipt showing that this debt has been\npaid. \n1.c.

Ex II is a copy of\nApplicant\u2019s bank statement showing this debt was paid.\n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,507. Applicant\ntestified that he has included this debt among those to be resolved through the law firm. \nNo payment has yet been made on this debt, but Applicant has now put in place a plan\nto resolve this debt.  \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,509. Applicant\ntestified that he had made one payment of settlement on this debt in the amount of\n$515, and he has five more payments of $515 to make before the debt is resolved.  Ex\nPP is a copy of a settlement letter offer from the creditor on this debt. Ex QQ confirms\nthat one payment has been made thus far on this debt.  \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,239.  This debt is\nto the same creditor as 1. e., above. Applicant is making payments of $100 a month to\nresolve this debt.\n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,701.  This debt is\nalso to the same creditor as 1. e. and 1.f., above. Applicant did not believe that he had\nmore than two debts to this creditor, a credit card company, and so he has written a\nletter to the creditor, trying to get a further explanation (Ex Z). He testified that if it shows\nthat he owes this debt, he will add this debt to those being resolved by the law firm.\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,158. This is the\nfourth debt to the same creditor as 1. e. through 1.g., above. Applicant did not believe\nthat he had more than two debts to this creditor, so he has written a letter to the creditor\ntrying to get a further explanation (Ex AA). He testified that if it shows that he owes this\ndebt, he will he will add this debt to those being resolved by the law firm.\n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $20,000.  Applicant\ntestified that he has included this debt among those to be resolved through the law firm.\nNo payment has yet been made on this debt, but Applicant now has a plan to resolve\nthis debt, that was for a vehicle that had been owned by him and his ex-wife, and that\nwas voluntarily repossessed by the seller.   \n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,636.  Applicant\ntestified that this is a duplication of 1.a., above, which he is in the process of being\nresolved. \n1.k.

This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,433.  Applicant\ntestified that this is a duplication of 1.b., above, which has been paid. \n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,409.  This is the\nfifth debt to the same creditor as 1. e. through 1.h., above. Applicant did not believe that\nhe had more than two debts to this creditor, so he has written a letter to the creditor\ntrying to get a further explanation (Ex BB). He testified that if it shows that he owes this\ndebt, he will he will add this debt to those being resolved by the law firm.  \n1.p. Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court on March 31,1998\nfor a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s of Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged on July 7,\n1998, with the exception of his car loan, which he continued to make payments on until\nhe paid it off completely. \nApplicant cited several reasons for his financial difficulties. He testified that when\nhe was deployed overseas, unbeknownst to him, his first wife incurred a great deal of\ndebt. Since he did not have the income to resolve these debts, he determined to file for\nbankruptcy to discharge these debts. His second wife also incurred debt, while he was\ndeployed. His current overdue debts occurred, because he focused on paying for the\nmedical care of his wife and mother, who have suffered from cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, respectively. Applicant testified that despite medical insurance from the Army,\nhis out of pocket expenses for his wife\u2019s care was $68,432 and for his mother he paid\n$11,000. These medical bills have all now been paid in full by Applicant, and he testified\nthat had he not had these bills, he would have already resolved the debts listed on the\nSOR.\nApplicant testified that he is now in control of his debts in a way that he was not\nwhen he served in the military. Since he will not be deployed as he was in the Army, he\ncan keep track of his bills to make sure they are paid, and are not overdue.  He also is\nexpecting to be promoted and transferred to a less expensive part of the country, which\nwill increase his net income. Finally, his wife, who is now in full remission from her\ncancer, is anticipating being employed and that will increase the family income, and help\nthem to resolve these overdue bills, and live within their means in the future.\nApplicant offered into evidence three letters from individuals who know in his\nprofessional and/or personal life (Exhibits A through C). They spoke in extremely\nlaudatory terms, describing him as trustworthy, responsible and patriotic. He also\nsubmitted his five most current NCO Evaluation Reports for years 1998 through 2002\n(Exhibits D through H). His ratings were generally Excellent and in the Values category\nhe was described as \u201cTotally committed to living Army Values,\u201d Honesty and Loyalty are\nabove reproach,\u201d and Dedication to duty and to soldiers is unsurpassed.\u201d\n\n5\nFinally, Applicant offered into evidence a number of awards and medals that he\nhas received including: three FEMA Certificates of Achievement (Exhibits J through L),\nfour Certificates of Achievement (Exhibits N through Q), three USA, Meritorious Service\nMedals (R through T), The Army Commendation Medal (Exhibit U), and The Army\nAchievement Medal (Exhibit V).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s former wive\u2019s spending while\nApplicant was deployed overseas, and his continuing to take care of his mother and\ncurrent wife and their medical difficulties.  Mitigating Condition (d) is also applicable\nsince Applicant is now making a good faith effort to resolve and repay these overdue\ndebts. These mitigating conditions are factors for consideration in this case. \n l find that Applicant is now more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude that he has mitigated the financial concerns.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Conditions (b) and (c) apply, together with Applicant\u2019s\nexemplary military career and dedication to the defense of our country, I find that the\nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 5, 2007, and elected\nto have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nApril 10, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted 14 documents in support of its case.\n2\n2\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 29, 2008.  Applicant received a\n2\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on March 4, 2008, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional material. I received the case\nassignment on April 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.r, alleging\nApplicant is indebted to a company on an automobile loan account that was initially\nreferred to another company for collection in about July 2003 and subsequently\ncharged off in the amount of $10,952.88. As of August 21, 2007, this debt has not ben\npaid. Applicant was provided notice of the amendment and filed no objection.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 16, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1,e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 2.a, 2.b(2) and\n(4). He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, 2.b(1) and (3) of\nthe SOR (Item 2). He neither admitted no denied the allegations of subparagraph 3.a.\nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a public\ntrust position.  \nApplicant is a 41-year old employee of a defense contractor. He initially\nsubmitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, on November 25, 2005, which he\nresigned and certified on March 24, 2006, and May 25, 2006 (Item 4). He served in the\nNational Guard from 1988 until 1998. He served in the U.S. Army from January 1998\nuntil February 2000, and he held a security clearance (Id). He is divorced with one child.\nIn 1999 and 2000, while in the military, Applicant was charged with domestic\nassault offenses on three separate occasions. Specifically, on October 20, 1999, he\nand his wife were engaged in a verbal exchange which turned into a physical altercation\nwhen Applicant slapped his wife in the face, grabbed her and threw her on the floor\n(Item 8). He was charged with assault (domestic disturbance) (Item 9). On November 7,\n1999, Applicant struck his wife in the head area with an open and closed fist (Item10).\nHe was charged with aggravated assault. On January 9, 2000, Applicant was again\ninvolved in a verbal altercation with his wife when he struck her. He was charged with\nassault (domestic disturbance with injuries (Item 12). He explained that his wife\ncommitted adultery on many occasions and he is guilty of not handling the situation in a\nbetter way. He believed the anger was justified but he reported that he took anger\nmanagement classes. Applicant believes these incidents were removed from his record.\n\nThis includes the amount  in amended allegation 1.r.\n3\n3\nApplicant has worked for his current employer since November 2005. He\nreported a period of unemployment from February 2000 until April 2000, and April 2004\nuntil sometime in 2005 on his security application. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $20,202.88.\nApplicant admits to approximately $19,000 in delinquent debt.   Applicant asserts that\n3\nthe accounts in allegations \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1,j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n, are\neither unknown to him or he has never been contacted by the creditor. Applicant alleges\nthe debt in \u00b6 1.f is paid (ARMY COM CTR) because \u201cthe military does not allow\ndischarge before all bills/debts have been paid.\u201d In response to some allegations,\nApplicant states he is willing to resolve the debt if contacted. Applicant provided no\ndocumentation of payment or payment plan for any of the debts (Item 5).\nWhen Applicant signed his Standard Form SF 85P, Questionnaire for Public\nTrust Position on three separate dates, he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 20 and 22\nconcerning his police record and financial delinquencies.\nApplicant denied having been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts\nwithin the prior 7 years. Applicant explained in his answer to his interrogatories that he\nhad no idea of the debts until he was confronted with this information. He maintains that\nhe has never been contacted by any of the creditors so that he would have an\nopportunity to resolve the debts (Item 5). He also had inconsistent responses in the\ninterrogatories compared to his admission and denials in the answer to the SOR. For\nexample, he would admit the debt, but then state in the interrogatory that he has done\nnothing to resolve it because he was not aware of the debt.\nApplicant did not list any arrests and/or charges on his SF 85P, because he\nbelieved it was removed from his record. He further explained the \u201cmilitary incident\u201d was\nof a personal nature.\nIn January 2006, Applicant was charged and arrested with driving under a\nsuspension. He admits to this violation in his response to the FORM. He was fined\n$647.50. However, he did not list this in response to question 20. Applicant\u2019s reasoning\nwas that it thought the questions referred to felonies and not fines (Item 5).\nIn Applicant\u2019s March 24, 2008 letter in response to the FORM, he asserted that\nhe is a trustworthy and dependable person who is worthy of a trustworthiness\ndetermination. He regrets his poor judgment and admits some bad choices with respect\nto finances. He does not consider himself a risk.  Applicant did not provide any\nadditional information concerning the reasons for his financial difficulties or his inability\nto pay his delinquent debts. \n \n\n4\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated  delinquent debt on numerous\naccounts charged off or placed in collection beginning in 2000. He admits to $19,000 of\ndelinquent debt that is not resolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial difficulties arose in 2000 and are ongoing at the\npresent. He accumulated delinquent debt but provided no reasons for the\naccumulations. He did not present any evidence to persuade me that it is unlikely to\nrecur, nor that it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. The evidence does not raise this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant listed two distinct periods of unemployment in his application. However, he\n\n6\ndid not elaborate on them, nor did he explain what, if any, impact it had on his ability to\npay his debts. He presented no evidence to show that he acted responsibly in\nidentifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a\nfactor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not present any information concerning\ncounseling. He has not resolved his delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement.\nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\n16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, Applicant offered explanations for his not listing the overdue debts\nand the assault incidents on his public trust questionnaire. However, the explanations\nare inconsistent and not reasonable. It is not reasonable to conclude that he was not\naware of the many delinquent debts over a period of almost seven years, nor that he\nwas never notified of the delinquent debt. He admitted to several of the incidents that\noccurred with his wife when he was in the military. However, he did not list them\nbecause he thought that they were to be removed from his record.  This leaves me with\nthe conclusion that he deliberately omitted them in the hopes that they would not be\ndiscovered. I find that he intentionally omitted relevant information from his application\nin 2005 and again when he resigned the application on two occasions in 2006. None of\nthe mitigating conditions apply.\n\n7\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity create doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 31(a), an \u201csingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201can allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d may raise security concerns. As discussed above, Applicant intentionally\nfalsified his public trust application. He re-certified the information in May 2006. This is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nWhile the incidents of domestic violence are in the distant past and have not\nrecurred, they are not considered for mitigation purposes because Applicant lied on his\nquestionnaire. None of the mitigating conditions apply under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant served in the military and\nthe reserves. He has been employed with his current employer since 2005. He held a\nclearance while in the military. Applicant expresses regret for his actions and poor\njudgment. However, he has not provided any mitigating information concerning his\nfinancial problems nor his plan to resolve them. Moreover, he falsified his\ntrustworthiness application as recently as may 2006. This is a violation of Federal law\nunder Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which is a felony.  \n\n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nApplicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 19, 2007.  Applicant also submitted a Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86) on June 20, 2005.  He updated that application and re-signed and re-dated it on \nJanuary 23, 2008.  On February 22, 2008, The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H for drug involvement and Guideline J for criminal conduct.  The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 28, 2008, and answered \nthe allegations in writing on March 18, 2008.  He admitedall of the allegations under \nGuidelines H and J, and requested a decision on the record without a hearing.  On \nMarch 2, 2008, pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing in this case.  On August 13, 2008, Department Counsel amended \nDecember 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nthe SOR to add seven allegations under Guideline E for personal conduct.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the amended SOR on September 6, 2008, and admitted the \nallegations under Guideline E with explanation.   \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on October 27, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me the same day.  DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on November 3, 2008, for a hearing on November 19, 2008.  I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  The government offered 15 exhibits, marked Government \nExhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 15, which were received without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on December \n1, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and has worked for the last four years as a telecom \ntechnician for a defense contractor.  He held an interim security clearance since working \nwith the defense contractor.  He is a high school graduate with some college courses.  \nHe is married with no children.  Applicant graduated from high school in June 1999 and \nentered active duty with the Navy in September 1999.  He served on active duty for over \nfive years until December 2004 as an operations specialist radar technician.  He held a \nsecurity clearance while on active duty.  He received an administrative discharge under \nother than honorable conditions in lieu of a court-martial (Tr. 47-50; Gov. Ex. 1, E-QIP, \ndated January 19, 2007; Gov. Ex. 13, DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from \nActive Duty, dated December 4, 2004). \n \n \nApplicant received three non-judicial punishments while on active duty.  In \nDecember 2001, he received a non-judicial punishment for misbehavior of a sentinel \nwhen he fell asleep while serving as a lookout on a cruiser.  He was sentenced to 15 \ndays restriction to his ship and 15 days extra duty (Gov. Ex. 7, Administrative Remarks, \ndated December 18, 2001).  In November 2003, Applicant received non-judicial \npunishment for being drunk and disorderly and unfit for duty.  He was sentenced to a \nreduction in grade, suspended for six months, forfeiture of $200 pay per month for one \nmonth, and 30 days restriction to the ship and extra duty (Gov. Ex. 8, Court \nMemorandum dated November 18, 2003).  He received another non-judicial punishment \nin January 2004 for failure to obey the order on his restriction.  The suspension of his \nreduction was vacated and he received 15 additional days of restriction and extra duty \n(Tr. 54-59; Gov. Ex. 9, Court Memorandum, dated January 13, 2004; Gov. Ex. 10, \nCaptain's Mast, dated January 13, 2004).   \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in August 2004 for possession and use of marijuana on \nvarious occasions from January 2003 until June 2004.  Applicant admitted to Japanese \npolice that he used and possessed marijuana (Gov. Ex. 11, Statement, dated October \n5, 2004).  On the advice of counsel, Applicant submitted a request for separation in lieu \nof court-martial.  His request was granted and he was separated in December 2004 \nunder other than honorable conditions (Gov. Ex. 12, Administrative Separation, dated \n\n \n3 \n \nOctober 28, 2004; See also, Gov. Ex. 14, Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal \nJustice Information, dated February 13, 2007). \n \n \nApplicant admits that he used marijuana about five or six times in high school \nstarting when he was 15 years old.  He admits to using marijuana about ten times while \non active duty and while holding a security clearance spread out over the years of 2002 \nand 2003.  He was tested by urinalysis numerous times while on active duty but never \ntested positive.  He admitted to the use and possession of marijuana in 2004 because \nhe was advised if he did not admit to the offense he would be turned over to the \nJapanese criminal authorities and jailed in a Japanese jail.  He did not want to be sent \nto a Japanese jail (Tr-51-54; Gov. Ex. 3, Interview, dated April 9, 2007).  Applicant \nstated that his last use of marijuana was shortly before being apprehended in 2004.  He \nwas last around people who used marijuana in 2005 when he attend a family function \nwhere some attendees used marijuana.  He has never been involved with law \nenforcement except for the offenses listed above during his time in the Navy.  He has \nnot received any counseling for drug use or been advised he is a drug abuser or is drug \ndependent (Tr. 59-62).   \n \n \nApplicant submitted his first security clearance application when he entered \nactive duty.  Even though he had used marijuana in high school starting in 1995, he \nanswered \"NO\" to question 24 concerning the use of controlled substances since the \nage of 16 or in the last seven years.  Applicant stated he was advised by the recruiter \nnot to include his use of drugs in high school on the application (Tr. 66-67; Gov. Ex. 15, \nQuestionnaire for National Security Position, dated March 27, 1999).  Applicant \ncompleted a new security clearance application in June 2006 when he started \nemployment for the defense contractor.  He updated that form in January 2008.  He \nanswered \"No\" to questions 27 and 28 on both applications, concerning his use of \nillegal drugs in the last seven years or while holding a security clearance (Tr. 62-63; \nGov. Ex. 5, Security Clearance Application, dated June 20, 2005).  He also answered \n\"No\" to questions 24a and b on a security clearance application submitted on January \n19, 2007 (Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated January 19, 2007).   \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to Interrogatories asking about his use of illegal drugs.  He \nresponded that he experimented with marijuana once or twice on weekends over two \nmonths in high school but stopped in September 1996.  He stopped because he was \nmore into sports. He stated that using illegal substance was one of his worst mistakes \nand he stays away for places where drugs are located as well as people using drugs \n(Gov. Ex. 4, Interrogatories, dated December 14, 2007). \n \n \nA 20 year experienced security agent interviewed Applicant about his drug use.  \nThe agent had copies of a Navy Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) report stating that \nApplicant admitted using marijuana in Japan in the summer of 2004.  Applicant denied \ndrug use in Japan in 2004 and admitted only that he used marijuana a few times in high \nschool when he was 15 years old.  He informed the agent that he admitted to the NCIS \nagent and the Japanese police that he used drugs because of the NCIS agent's threat \nto place him in a Japanese jail.  Applicant insisted he did not use illegal drugs in the \n\n \n4 \n \nNavy.  The agent did not believe Applicant told the truth at the interview (Tr. 30-40; Gov. \nEx. 3, Interview, dated April 9, 2007). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not tell the truth about his \nmarijuana use in the Navy.  Concerning the interview with the security agent, Applicant \nadmitted that he did not tell the truth stating: \n \nI'm not denying that, what Agent (X) said about me not being truthful about \nthe marijuana usage.  I mean I admitted that in a document and that was \nsent to DOHA.  They have that on file, and, honestly, I was scared of \nlosing my security clearance.  That's why I wasn't truthful about it and I \nrealize it was a bad decision, I know it was a bad decision and if I could \ntake it back I would, but, just being honest, I was scared and I wasn't \ntruthful about it. \n \nQuite honestly, I'm basically here just to own up everything that's put out \nthere.  I mean, I've been truthful, I haven't been truthful before, but I'm \nbeing truthful now and everything, the whole allegations have been \nagainst me, and basically, I'm here just to own up to it, whatever, I have to \nown up to.\" (Tr. 45-46). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n5 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  Drug \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction (AG \u00b6 24). \n \nThe information in the exhibits presented at the hearing by the government and \nApplicant's answers and testimony are sufficient to raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying \nConditions (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) \"any drug use\", DI DC AG \u00b6 25(c) \"illegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution\", and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) \"any illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance\".  It is clear from Applicant's own statement that he used marijuana in high \nschool until 1999, and from about 2002 until 2004 while in the Navy and while holding a \nsecurity clearance.  His drug use was continuous and not simply drug experimentation \nand causes security clearance concerns. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate his use of illegal drug (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15).  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.   \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and DI MC \u00b6 26(b) \"a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\".  Applicant's last use of \nan illegal drug was in the summer of 2004.  While he had an opportunity to use illegal \ndrugs in the summer of 2005, he did not do so.  It has been four years since his last \nreported use of illegal drugs, and there has been no adverse information about drug use \nsince then.  Applicant has stated his intent not to use drugs in the future. He stated he \nno longer goes to places where drugs are used or associates with people that use \ndrugs.  His testimony is sufficient information to establish he no longer uses illegal \ndrugs.  Additionally, sufficient time has passed since his last use of illegal drugs to \nindicate he no longer uses illegal drugs.  Applicant met his heavy burden of establishing \nthat his past drug use does not now raise questions concerning his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  I find for \nApplicant as to drug involvement under Guideline H. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information during the security clearance process.  If a person conceals or \nprovides false information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to \nensure that granting access to classified information is in the best interest of the United \nStates Government.  Applicant\u2019s false answers to questions on his security clearance \napplications, his answers to the questions in the Interrogatories, as well as the answers \nto the security agent concerning drug use raise security concerns under Personal \nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to \ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness); and PC DC AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately \nproviding false and misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative). \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAppellant admitted he provided false information on his security clearance \napplications, as well as in response to the Interrogatory questions, and to the security \nagent.  He admitted at the hearing that he had not been truthful about his use of drugs \nin the past.  At the hearing, Applicant was truthful about his past drug use and his past \nfalse answers during the security clearance process.  Applicant's admission leaves no \ndoubt that he deliberately provided false information with the intent to deceive up to the \nhearing part of the security clearance process.  I find that Applicant deliberately \nprovided false information on his security applications and to security investigators.  \n \n \nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand determine none apply.  Applicant did not make a good faith effort to correct \nerroneous or inaccurate information even though he had numerous opportunities to do \nso.  He did not even tell the truth to the security agent In April 2007 even after being \nreminded of his statement to the Japanese police and NCIS agents.  He did not provide \ncorrect information until he decided to tell the truth at the hearing.  He was not \nerroneously advised by anyone to provide false information.  His untruthful statements \nare numerous and the last false statement to the security agent was only a little over a \nyear ago.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  Applicant violated federal law by \nknowingly and willfully providing false information on his security clearance application \nand to a security investigator (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001) but this was not alleged as a criminal \nconduct security concern and will not be considered a criminal conduct security \nconcern.  Applicant was discharged from the Navy with a discharge under other than \nhonorable conditions in lieu of court-martial for use and possession of an illegal drug, \nmarijuana.  This conduct raises Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \n\u00b6 31 (a) \"a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\", and CD DC AG \u00b6 31 (c) \n\"allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\".   \n \nI have considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) \"so \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cost doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\"  The use of an illegal drug in \nviolation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice took place over four years ago.  \nApplicant received a discharge from the Navy under other than honorable conditions in \nlieu of court-martial for this criminal act.  The passage of time and the unusual nature of \nthe offense show it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  I find for Applicant as to criminal conduct. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant served \nover five years on active duty in the Navy and has held a security clearance for a \nnumber of years.  I considered that his employment record is good and that he has not \ntested positive for drug use.  I considered that Applicant used illegal drugs for many \nyears and then lied about his use on security clearance applications and to a security \ninvestigator.  Applicant has now admitted that he provided false information with the \nintent to deceive.  Acknowledging deceitful conduct is a step in rehabilitation.  But \nApplicant had about five opportunities to provide correct information and did not do so.  \nHe only recently spoke the truth at the hearing.  Sufficient time to establish a record of \ntruthfulness has not passed to indicate that Applicant will continue to tell the truth in the \nfuture.  Only a period of time of truthfulness will overcome the previous numerous \nuntruthfulness.  The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant's continued truthfulness.  I have doubts about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance because he repeatedly provided false information on his security \nclearance applications and to a security investigator.  For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.  He \nhas mitigated security concerns for his criminal conduct and drug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: John F. Mardula, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H\nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 16, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on December 3, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 14, 2008 scheduling it for February 5, 2008. The hearing was held as\nscheduled. During the hearing, I received three government exhibits, two Applicant\nexhibits, one joint exhibit, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses. At the\nhearing\u2019s close, the record was left open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow her to submit an\nadditional exhibit. She did so within the allotted time, and I incorporated it into the\nMarch 13, 2008\n\n2\nrecord. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except subparagraphs 2. b. She is\na 43-year-old married woman with two children, ages 13 and 10, and an adult stepson.\nShe earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical design technology in 1992, and\nin 2001, she began working toward a master\u2019s degree in the same field. She is six\ncredits short of completion.\nSince graduating from college, Applicant has worked for several defense\ncontractors, and has continuously held a security clearance. (Tr. 42, Exhibit 1 at 29).\nShe has been working with her current employer since 2002 and is highly respected on\nthe job. A supervisor from a former job characterized her as a meticulous and top-notch\nengineer (Tr. 20, 23). According to the division chief of her current company, their\ncustomers have been very impressed with her work (Tr. 31).\nBetween 1979 and 1990, Applicant smoked marijuana four times. The first time\nwas in junior high school, the next two times were in college in the late 1980's, and the\nfourth time was in 1990 (Exhibit 2 at 4).\nApplicant did not use marijuana between 1990 and 1998 (Tr. 108). In December\n1998, her mother died. Her corresponding grief combined with the stress of managing\nher home while working at a job with a 160-mile per day commute, rendered her unable\nto sleep (Tr. 47, 103, 111, Exhibit A). Applicant then resumed marijuana use, smoking it\ntwo to three times per week to help her sleep (Tr. 54). During some of these occasions,\nshe purchased it. When asked at the hearing if she considered prescription medication\nfor her sleeping problem, she replied, \u201c. . . my husband takes about seven pills and I\ndidn\u2019t want to take pills . . .\u201d (Tr. 115). \nBetween January 1999 and July 2001, Applicant treated with various counselors\nfor grief counseling and stress management. From January to March 1999, she treated\nwith a counselor through a program her employer offered (Tr. 55). Approximately a year\nlater, she treated with a \u201cregression therapist\u201d for approximately two months (Tr. 55, 60\nExhibit A). It is unclear from the record what the field of regression therapy entails. \nBetween June and July 2001, Applicant treated with a psychotherapist (Exhibit\nC). She was diagnosed with, among other things, marijuana addiction. Applicant was\nsincerely committed to controlling her addictive behaviors during the treatment (Id.).\nAfter the 2001 counseling ended, Applicant used marijuana on two more\noccasions; once during a January 2002 party, and once on a Saturday afternoon in\n2005. During the last incident, she was house-sitting for a friend when she discovered a\n\n3\ndiscarded marijuana cigarette in an ashtray and decided, out of curiosity, to smoke it\n(Tr. 107, Exhibit 3 at 2).\nCurrently, Applicant neither smokes marijuana nor intends to smoke it in the\nfuture (Tr. 104, Exhibit B). She no longer associates with anyone who smokes\nmarijuana (Tr. 105).\nIn November 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In\nresponse to the question of whether she had used illegal drugs within the past seven\nyears, she answered \u201cYes,\u201d and specified the number of times she used it, the time\nperiods, and the surrounding circumstances (Exhibit 1 at 29). She used the \u201cAdditional\nComments\u201d section to elaborate upon information about her marijuana use that was not\nspecifically requested elsewhere in the application (Id. at 29). She answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nQuestion 24b. (Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a\nlaw enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official, while possessing a security\nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety?).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\n\n4\nrules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant smoked marijuana between 1979 and 1990,\nresumed it in the late 1990s at a time when she possessed a security clearance, and\nused it twice after attending counseling in 2001. She purchased it on some occasions.\nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . ,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by\na duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use\nafter being granted a clearance\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s disassociation from drug-using associates, and submission of a\nstatement of intent not to abuse any drugs in the future trigger the application of AG \u00b6\n26(b)(1), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as [a]\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) \u201ca signed\nstatement of intent [not to use illegal drugs] with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nI am not persuaded Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement security\nconcern. The period of heaviest usage occurred between 1999 and 2002 when she was\nin her mid-thirties. Although she attributes this use to grief and anxiety related to her\nmother\u2019s death; the last use during this period, in January 2002, occurred at a party.\nMoreover, she used marijuana on two occasions after receiving counseling for\nmarijuana addiction. I was particularly troubled by the circumstances surrounding the\nsecond, post-counseling marijuana usage.\nApplicant deserves credit for remaining drug-free for the past two and a half\nyears. This period of abstinence, however, is outweighed by the length of time of her\npast marijuana use, her age during the heaviest use, her use while holding a clearance,\nand her recurrence after receiving counseling. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug\ninvolvement security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Here, the government alleges Applicant lied to an investigative\nagent in 1993 when she said that her last use was in October 1990 (SOR subparagraph\n2.a.), and falsified a 2006 security clearance application by answering \u201cNo\u201d to Question\n24b (SOR subparagraph 2.b). \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant used drugs between October 1990\nand October 1993 when the agent interviewed her. Consequently, the government\nfailed to prove any falsification occurred. \nApplicant asserts that she misread Question 24b. and thought she was only\nsupposed to answer \u201cYes\u201d if she used marijuana while employed as a law enforcement\n\n5\nofficer, prosecutor, or courtroom official. Given her comprehensive responses to the\nother questions about drug use, I conclude her explanation was credible. None of the\npersonal conduct disqualifying conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nI addressed these factors at the conclusion of the Drug Involvement section of\nthe decision. Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 19, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on March 24, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 11, 2008, and I received the case \n \n1 \n \nJuly 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nassignment on April 16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 5, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2008. The government offered Exhibits \n(Gov Ex) 1 through 11, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his \nown behalf, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-G, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open until June 19, 2008. Applicant \nsubmitted two documents which were admitted as AE H (10 pages) and AE I (2 pages). \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2008. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.i, \n1.l, 1,m, 1.o-1.q, 1.t, and 1.u. He denies SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, 1.k, 1.n, 1.r, 1.s, 2.a, \n2.b and 3.a.  In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old male employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nwho is seeking a position of public trust. He has worked for his employer as system \nspecialist since October 2001. He is a high school graduate and has some college credit. \nFrom July 1992 to July 2001, he served on active duty in the United States Navy. He was a \ncryptologic technician. He separated as an E-6 with an honorable discharge. He served in \nthe United States Naval Reserves for three years after separating from active duty. He has \na two-year-old daughter, and lives with the mother of his child who he refers to as his \ncommon law wife.  She served as his personal representative. (Tr at 6-7, 11, 23-24, 44-46; \nGov 1; Gov 2 at 12.) In this decision, she is referred to as Applicant\u2019s companion.  \n \nOn January 4, 2007, Applicant submitted a questionnaire for public trust position, \nStandard Form 85P as part of a routine periodic reinvestigation.  He answered, \u201cNo\u201d in \nresponse to question 22a. which asks, \u201cYour Financial Record. In the last 7 years, have \nyou, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been \ndeclared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against you \nfor a debt? If you answered \u201cYes,\u201d provide date of initial action and other information \nrequested below.\u201d  He did not list two judgments entered against him which are alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  He also answered , \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 22b, which asks, \n\u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or \nobligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government. If you answered, \u201cYes,\u201d \nprovide the information requested below.\u201d (Gov 1.) He did not list 19 delinquent debts that \nwere over 180 days old which are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.s. (Gov 1.) \n \nA subsequent background investigation discovered the following delinquent \naccounts: a $385 judgment entered against Applicant in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 4 at \n2); a $3,270 judgment entered against Applicant in September 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 4 at \n4); a $9,216 debt related to a car repossession in December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 4 at 5); \na $5,413 government overpayment debt, charged off in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 4 at 5); \na $3,271 debt related to a car repossession in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 4 at 6); a \n\n \n3 \n \n$1,210  credit card account charged off in May 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Gov 4 at 6); a $470 cell \nphone account charged off in December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Gov 4 at 4); a $183 bank \naccount, placed for collection in April 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Gov 4 at 6); a $122 telephone \naccount, placed for collection in May 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Gov 4 at 7); a $592 telephone \naccount, placed for collection in February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Gov 4 at 10); a $3,216 debt for \npast due rent, placed for collection in February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.k; Gov 4 at 9); a $2,031 \naccount placed for collection in November 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.l; Gov 4 at 9); a $941 bank debt \nplaced for collection in September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.m; Gov 4 at 10); a $407 telephone \naccount placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.n; Gov 4 at 11); a $198 telephone \naccount placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.o; Gov 4 at 11); a $178 insurance \naccount placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.p; Gov 4 at 11); a $75 insurance \naccount placed for collection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.q; Gov 4 at 12); a $144 cable television \naccount placed for collection in December 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.r; Gov 4 at 12); a $74 account, \nplaced for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.s; Gov 4 at 12); and an $855 account placed \nfor collection in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.t; Gov 3 at 2).  \n \nApplicant claims the accounts did not show up on his trustworthiness application due \nto a typographical error.  He spent a few days filling out the application and listed his debts \non the electronic application.  He claims that when he hit the tab key to go to the next \nsection, the computer program deleted his listed delinquent debts. He did not review his \ntrustworthiness application before signing and turning in the document. He did not discover \nthe error until he was interviewed by the investigator conducting his background \ninvestigation in February 2007. (Tr at 86-89.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s companion testified. She has known Applicant since May 2005. She says \nthat Applicant is an excellent father and responsible human being. She works in the same \nbuilding as Applicant but in a different department. She states Applicant is professional at \nwork. She and Applicant live together with their daughter. (Tr at 44-47.)      She states that \nApplicant recently took out a $3,000 loan from his 401(k) account intending to use the \nmoney to pay off some delinquent accounts. She encountered a legal issue so most of the \nmoney had to be used for her legal fees. (Tr at 45-49.) They had discussed resolving the \ndelinquent accounts over the past several years but have taken no action.  Most of the \ndelinquent debts belong to Applicant. His companion went through a divorce in 2005. She \nfiled bankruptcy in October 2006 and her debts were discharged. (Tr at 53-54.)   \n \nWhile on active duty in the United States Navy, Applicant encountered some \nfinancial problems.  He claims the financial difficulties were caused by the change in pay \nreceived when he transferred to different locations.  In 1999, his access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) was suspended as a result of his financial problems. In \nMarch 2001, he took a class on how the manage his finances. Applicant was unemployed \nfor three months after separating from active duty. When he accepted a full-time position \nwith his current employer, his annual income was $37,000 a year.  He now earns $48,000 a \nyear. (Tr at 60-64, 93; Gov 6.)  \n \nApplicant claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, 1.n. 1.r, and 1.s are paid. (Tr \nat 70-73, 76-78, 80.) He provided proof that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s was paid. (AE I \n\n \n4 \n \nat 2.) He did not provide proof, such as receipts, that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, \n1.n, and 1.r  were paid. He disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.k.  This is a debt for unpaid \nrent after breaking a lease.  Applicant was recalled to active duty in February 2002. He \nstates he formally notified his apartment office in order to be released from the lease early. \nHe claims that he disputed the debt on his credit report. (Tr. at 74-76.) Applicant provided a \ncopy of the orders recalling him to active duty. (AE H at 2-5.) He was released from active \nduty on May 26, 2002. (Gov 2 at 12.) He provided no additional evidence such as written \nnotification to the apartment that he was being called to active duty.  \n \nApplicant has not taken steps to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, , 1.l, 1,m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.t.  He admits that they are his debts but \nclaims the additional expenses of raising a child has prevented him from resolving these \naccounts. (Tr at 81-83.)  \n \nApplicant and his companion operate from a joint budget. (Tr at 70.) A personal \nfinancial statement Applicant submitted in response to interrogatories on October 29, 2007, \nindicates a net monthly income of $4,341.  Total monthly expenses are $3,560. Applicant \nand his companion have approximately $781 left over each month after expenses. (Gov 2 \nat 10.)  Applicant and his companion have a joint savings account with a $700 balance. (Tr. \nat 86.)  He is current on federal and state taxes. In May 2008, he received a $1,200 \neconomic stimulus check from the federal government. He put $600 in savings and applied \nthe rest towards current expenses. (Tr at 65-67.)  \n \nA co-worker of Applicant\u2019s testified that he has known Applicant since 2001 when \nthey were co-workers for the same defense contractor. Applicant now works for another \ndefense contractor but they work at the same location. He has daily contact with Applicant \nat work. He indicates Applicant is extremely professional and has outstanding character. (Tr \nat 36-41.)  Applicant\u2019s performance reviews indicate he meets his objectives. (AE A \u2013 AE \nF.)  \n  \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  AThe standard that must be met for . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person=s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See Regulation & \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply \nto cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n6 \n \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  He encountered financial issues while on active duty in the Navy \nwhich resulted in his access to SCI being suspended in 1999. Since his separation from \nactive duty in 2001, he has incurred 20 delinquent debts, a total approximate balance of \n$33,079.      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s history of \nfinancial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating condition. The majority of his \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) partially applies based on Applicant\u2019s three month period of \nunemployment after he separated from active duty. However, the majority of the delinquent \naccounts appear to have been incurred after Applicant\u2019s full-time employment in October \n2001. His lack of action towards resolving these accounts indicates a lack of responsibility \nand disregard for his financial obligations. FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given little weight.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) \ndoes not apply. In March 2001, Applicant attended a financial management class.  His track \nrecord of financial irresponsibility since that time indicates that he continues to have issues \nwith financial responsibility. The majority of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved.  It \nis unlikely his financial situation will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.s.  Although \nApplicant claims the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.r were paid, he provided no proof \nto verify his assertion.  His lack of initiative in resolving the other delinquent accounts gives \nthis mitigating condition less weight.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) \npotentially applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k for breaking his apartment \n\n \n7 \n \nlease. Applicant provided proof that he was recalled to active duty in February 2002. \nHowever, he did not dispute this debt in his response to interrogatories dated October 29, \n2007. (Gov 2 at 5.) He first raised this issue at hearing and provided no documentation \nsuch as the copy of the apartment lease and/or a written notice of early termination of his \nlease. He failed to meet his burden to successfully dispute this debt.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \n&15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list two judgments \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) entered against him within seven years of the date he filled out his \ntrustworthiness application in response to question 22a.  He also failed to list his delinquent \ndebts that were over 180 days old (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.r) in response to question 22b.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nomissions of his judgments and delinquent debts on his trustworthiness application. \nApplicant claims that the debts were deleted due to typographical error, claiming that he \ntyped all of the debts into the electronic questionnaire but the debts were deleted when he \nhit the tab key to move on to the next section. Considering Applicant\u2019s questionnaire for \npublic trust position, SF 85P, appears to be typewritten, I do not find his explanation \ncredible. (see Gov 1.)    \n  \n \nPersonal conduct concerns can be mitigated.  The following Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attempted to correct the omission of his financial \nissues on his trustworthiness application until the issue was raised in February 2007 during \nhis background investigation interview.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply.  Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his delinquent debts was \nserious.  His less than credible explanation as to why he omitted the delinquent debts on \nhis security clearance application raised questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) does not apply because Applicant has not \nacknowledged that he deliberately omitted his delinquent accounts on his trustworthiness \napplication.  \n \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under personal conduct. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \n \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) that apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. They are CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses); CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  Applicant\u2019s \ndeliberate omission of his two judgments and his delinquent debts that were over 180 days \nold on his trustworthiness application violated Title 18 U.S.C \u00a71001.  While somewhat \nredundant to the concerns raised under guideline E, personal conduct, his deliberate \nomissions raise a concern under criminal conduct.  When Applicant signed the \ntrustworthiness application, he certified that \u201cMy statements on this form, and any \nattachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief \nand are made in good faith. I understand that a knowing a willful false statement on this \nform can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of Title 18, United \nStates Code.)\u201d (Gov 1 at 7.)  Applicant was on notice that any false information provided on \nthe application was a crime.  \n \nThe criminal conduct concern can be mitigated. I find that it is premature to apply \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since \nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) because Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification was recent and he did not accept \n\n \n9 \n \nresponsibility for his deliberate omission.   \n \nIt is premature to apply CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement) for the same reasons mentioned above.   \n \nAt this time, it is premature to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the criminal \nconduct concern. \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service, the \nfavorable comments provided by the witnesses, and his six and half year employment \nhistory with his current employer.  Financial consideration concerns remain due to the \nextensive amount of delinquent debt Applicant has incurred since 2001 and his lack of \neffort towards resolving his delinquent accounts. His deliberate omissions of his delinquent \naccounts on his trustworthiness application raise questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising under financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal \nconduct. \n                                      \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Findings of Fact In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), siblings (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are resident citizens of Albania; that Applicant owns \u201chundreds of acres\u201d of land in Albania that he once valued at up to $1 million USD (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that in 1999, 2000, 3 2001, 2002, and 2005 he traveled to Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and to Yugoslavia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, and France (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he had changed his name and asked his spouse to change her name because he did not want them to be identified as natives of Albania when in Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and that he possesses a record from Albania\u2019s defense ministry documenting his military training (SOR \u00b6 1.h).

The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 14, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2008, and on June\n23, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for July 25, 2008.\nAugust 29, 2008\n\n2\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Fifteen government exhibits (Ex. 1-15) were\nadmitted. Applicant and three witnesses (his spouse, a family friend, and a coworker)\ntestified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on August 5, 2008. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, the record was held open for one week to allow him to submit\ndocumentation. On July 28, 2008, Applicant submitted his marriage certificate and a\nsettlement offer for the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.h. Department Counsel did not object to their\nadmission and the documents were entered as Exhibits A and B, respectively.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\n  \nOn May 23, 2008, the government moved to amend the SOR to add under\nGuideline E that Applicant deliberately falsified his May 25, 2005, SF 86 by not\ndisclosing his former military service for Albania (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e) or his\ndelinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g). In his response of June 7, 2008, Applicant\nadmitted the allegations but explained that he thought he only had to go back ten years,\nand with respect to the debts, that his wallet was stolen and he had not received any\nbills. On June 25, 2008, I granted the motion to amend, but informed the parties that the\nburden of proving intentional falsification was on the government in light of Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn May 23, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to Albania and its foreign relations, including to the U.S. The\nrequest was based on publications from the U.S. State Department and the U.S.\nEmbassy in Tirana, Albania. The government\u2019s formal request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record.\nOn June 25, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. Neither party filed any objections by the July 11, 2008,\ndue date. Before the introduction of any evidence at the July 25, 2008, hearing, I\nconfirmed there were no objections, but the government requested that notice also be\ntaken of two additional facts concerning travel to Albania. I agreed to take administrative\nnotice of those two facts as well as of pertinent facts concerning Albania, as set forth in\nthe June 25, 2008, Order. The facts administratively noticed are set forth below in the\nFindings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence,\nthat Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), siblings (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6\n1.b) are resident citizens of Albania; that Applicant owns \u201chundreds of acres\u201d of land in\nAlbania that he once valued at up to $1 million USD (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that in 1999, 2000,\n\n3\n2001, 2002, and 2005 he traveled to Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and to Yugoslavia, Germany,\nItaly, Switzerland, Greece, and France (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he had changed his name and\nasked his spouse to change her name because he did not want them to be identified as\nnatives of Albania when in Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and that he possesses a record from\nAlbania\u2019s defense ministry documenting his military training (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Under\nGuideline E, Applicant was alleged to have indicated in an affidavit presented to a\ngovernment investigator in January 2008 that he used U.S. travel documents for his\ntravel abroad when his U.S. passport does not include entry stamps for all the trips\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a); that in a January 2008 affidavit he had denied using his birth name since\nhis U.S. naturalization (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and that as noted above, he had not disclosed his\npast foreign military service on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e) or his delinquent\ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g). Under Guideline F, Applicant was alleged to owe eight\ndelinquent debts totaling $7,112 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.h). Applicant admitted the allegations\nwith the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d, but offered explanations for his failure to list\nhis military service and indebtedness on his SF 86 that, if proven, would indicate he did\nnot intend to conceal or deceive. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old mechanic (technical installation) who has been\nemployed by a defense contractor since late March 2004 (Ex. 1, Tr. 66). He seeks his\nfirst security clearance.\nApplicant was born in Albania in April 1967. The youngest of six children born to\nnative Albanian citizens, he attended an agricultural college in Albania from September\n1980 to June 1984 (Ex. 1, Tr. 64). He received training in a military college from\nJanuary 1987 to December 1988, and was awarded a degree/certificate (Ex. 1. Tr. 146).\nHe then served in an artillery division of the Albanian army, and spent about six months\nas an artillery instructor, until May/June 1990. On finishing his military obligation, he fled\nto Yugoslavia under cover of night. He was opposed to communism, and sought\npermission from the U.S. Embassy in Yugoslavia (now Serbia) to immigrate to the U.S.\n(Ex. 4, Tr. 66-68).\nIn late January 1991, he was issued a provisional travel certificate by the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees that was valid for travel to the U.S. Applicant\nwas granted permission to immigrate to the U.S. in March 1991, and he came to the\nU.S. under the sponsorship of a private foundation (Ex. 9, Tr. 68-70). Applicant knew no\nEnglish, and he socialized with another Albanian who had emigrated under the\nsponsorship of the same foundation (Tr.  159, 163).\nIn March 1992, he began working as a driver for a sweeping company. He\nworked in excess of 12 hours per day (Tr. 162). From 1994 to 2005, he traveled to\nAlbania to visit his family members (Tr. 152), passing through various European\n\nApplicant testified he traveled to Albania maybe more than 20 times since 1994 (Tr. 152). On his SF 86 (Ex.\n1\n1), he listed six separate trips between August 1998 and June 2002, although his U.S. passport (Ex. 2) does\nnot include stamps for all the trips.\nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s Background Note: Albania, dated January 2008, indicates that communism fell\n2\nin Albania in 1991, but much of the decade was marked by internal political deadlock. In early 1997 anarchy\nbroke out following the collapse of several pyramid schemes that left thousands bankrupt, disillusioned and\nangry. After a UN Multinational Protection Force restored order, Albania was led by a series of short-lived\nsocialist governments until July 2002. \n4\ncountries en route.  He had left his Albanian passport behind in Yugoslavia and\n1\npresented documents issued by the U.S. to reenter the U.S. On a trip in August  1998,\nhe used a reentry permit issued to him by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization\nService in April 1998 (Ex. 6, Ex. 8).\nIn February 1999, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Presented with\nthe opportunity to take a new name, he changed his name from his birth name to his\npresent name so that he would not be recognized as Albanian on future visits to his\nparents. Given the problems in Albania at the time, he feared the country would again\ncome under communist rule (Tr. 134-35).  Applicant did not renounce his Albanian\n2\ncitizenship out of respect for his family still residing there (Ex. 3). In March 1999,\nApplicant obtained his U.S. passport under his newly acquired name. The passport is\nvalid to March 2009 (Ex. 7). Applicant did not change his state motor vehicle operator\u2019s\nlicense to reflect his new name (Ex. 11).\nApplicant traveled to Albania on his U.S. passport to visit his family members in\nSeptember 1999. His brothers had arranged for him to marry a native Albanian, and\nApplicant met his spouse for the first time during his three-week trip to Albania (Ex. 3,\nTr. 33). She is from the same northern district in Albania where Applicant is from and\nwhere his family still resides. Applicant returned to Albania for a couple of weeks in July\n2000 to see his parents, siblings, and fiancee (Ex. 1, Ex. 3).\nIn October 2000, Applicant went to Albania for his marriage. His spouse took his\nnew last name even though Applicant wanted her to take his family name. They were\ntold they had no option (\u201cI wanted to put it [his birth surname] at that time I got married\nbut they won\u2019t let you, you know, you just have to go the last name of your husband,\nand I put it, okay, I said no problem.\u201d ) (Tr. 30, 87). He sponsored her immigration and\nshe eventually joined him in the U.S. in 2002 (Tr. 39, 74). She was only 22 at the time\nand had not worked in Albania (Tr. 39). They have two sons who were born in the U.S.\nin 2005 and 2006 (Ex. 1, Tr. 22, 65-66).\nIn early September 2001, Applicant began working as a driver/casket painter for\na casket company (Ex. 1). About a week later, his eldest brother, a veterinarian for the\nAlbanian government, was paralyzed in an accident involving a horse (Tr. 77-78, 82).\nApplicant traveled to Albania the following day and stayed a week (Ex. 2, Tr. ). In June\n2002, Applicant went back to Albania for about three weeks (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). \n\nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 contains an obvious error about a family relationship as his first son is listed as a\n3\nstepmother.\nHis U.S. passport (Ex. 2) bears stamps showing entry into Albania on \u201c03 LUG 2005\" and departing \u201c16 LUG\n4\n2005.\u201d On January 28, 2008, he signed an affidavit in which he indicated he went to Albania from 3 July 05\nto 16 July 05 (Ex. 5). Yet, in April 2007, he told the investigator that the trip was in June 2005 (Ex. 3), and at\nhis hearing, he testified that \u201cLUG\u201d was \u201cmonth six.\u201d (Tr. 141). The discrepancy is relevant to the extent it\nshows another inaccuracy about which the government expressed concern.\n5\nIn March 2004, Applicant started his employment with the defense contractor\nlearning to be a fabrication technician (Ex. 1). A year later, he applied for a security\nclearance for his duties. On his SF 86 executed on May 25, 2005, Applicant listed his\ndual citizenship with Albania and the U.S. since his naturalization in 1999. He disclosed\nhis birth name used until February 1999, his marriage in Albania in November 2004 [sic]\nto an Albanian native, and the Albanian citizenship and residency of his parents, his\nthree brothers, and one of his two sisters.  Applicant listed six foreign trips to Albania\n3\nsince August 1998, and listed all the European countries that he had passed through en\nroute to and from Albania in the past seven years. He did not disclose his prior military\nservice for Albania in response to question 11, \u201cHave you ever served in the military? (If\nyes, provide in chronological order your military history, begin with the most recent\nperiod and include Reserves, National Guard, Merchant Marines, and Foreign Military\nservice.).\u201d Nor did he indicate any foreign employment in response to question 33 or\nany contact with a foreign government in response to question 34, although he listed his\nmilitary schooling in response to the education inquiry (question 5). Applicant also\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to question 38 inquiring into any financial delinquencies over 180 days\nin the past seven years, and to question 39 asking about any debts currently over 90\ndays delinquent (SF 86). A check of Applicant\u2019s credit in August 2005 revealed past due\nbalances of $1,874 (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and $1,772 (SOR \u00b6 3.b) on two credit card accounts\ncharged off and/or placed for collection, a $335 debt in collection since February 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 3.c), and a $39 debt in collection since November 2002 (SOR \u00b6 3.d) (Ex. 15).\nDuring summer 2005, Applicant spent two weeks in Albania visiting his father,\nwho was very ill (Ex. 1, Ex. 2).  Applicant returned to Albania for his funeral in October\n4\n2005 (Ex. 2, Tr. 76). Applicant and his three brothers inherited hundreds of acres of land\nin Albania that they split up in equal shares. Applicant estimates the value of his land is\nmore than $1 million USD. His mother takes care of his land for him (Ex.  2, Ex. 5, Tr.\n34-36, 80-81).\nOn November 4, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his dual citizenship and foreign ties to Albania. Applicant explained he kept his\nAlbanian citizenship to maintain his family heritage, and because most of his family is\nthere and he owns land there. Applicant denied any other financial interests in Albania.\nApplicant discussed his service in the Albanian military from 1987 to 1989, and added\nthat he had later worked for the Albanian government for one month as an artillery\ninstructor. Applicant expressed a willingness to renounce his Albanian citizenship as a\ncondition of access because of the greater opportunities presented to him in the U.S.\nApplicant indicated he had close relationships with his mother, three brothers, a sister,\n\n6\nand his parents-in-law, all Albanian resident citizens. He was in telephone contact with\nhis mother daily, with his siblings monthly, and with his in-laws weekly. Applicant denied\nany of his relatives were vulnerable to duress or were hostile. He added that he\nmaintained a friendship with a police officer in Albania, whom he contacted once every\ntwo weeks (Ex. 4).\nApplicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator on April 6, 2007,\nconcerning his foreign travel to Albania. He indicated he went to Albania in June 2005\nwhen his father was sick and then returned in August 2005 [sic] for his father\u2019s funeral.\nWhen asked about his earlier travel, Applicant reported spending up to a week in Italy in\nconjunction with his trip to Albania in October 2001 [sic], two weeks in Yugoslavia in\nJuly 2000 en route to/from Albania, and one week in Switzerland and France in\nSeptember 1999, again in conjunction with a visit to his family in Albania. When asked\nabout his name change, Applicant indicated that he wanted a new start when he came\nto the U.S. and he feared the U.S. would look down on him for his last name. Applicant\nadded that his spouse used his birth surname and that she would officially become a\nU.S. citizen in September 2007. Applicant reportedly told the investigator that he had\ndaily contact with his mother but that he had no other contact with foreign nationals. He\ndenied any close contact with his siblings over the past few years (Ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse and their two sons spent the summer of 2007 in Albania.\nThey stayed one month with Applicant\u2019s mother and the other two months with her\nparents (Tr. 98). Applicant has not been to Albania since his father\u2019s funeral in October\n2005 because of the expense. He is the sole provider for his family (Tr. 77).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse became a U.S. citizen in about September 2007. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, she changed her last name to the family surname that he was given\nat birth.  He no longer had the same concerns if they should travel to Albania under that\nname and he wanted to ensure that his siblings\u2019 offspring would recognize the family\nrelationship (Tr. 30, 84-85). They had already changed their sons\u2019 surnames to his\nfamily name (Tr. 30).\nIn August 2007, DOHA asked Applicant to clarify his allegiance to the U.S. given\nhis dual citizenship status, and his ownership of property in Albania. In his response of\nAugust 20, 2007, Applicant averred his allegiance was with the U.S. where his children\nare citizens and he would base his decisions on them. Concerning future plans for his\nproperty in Albania, Applicant indicated that he owned several acres of open space\n\u201cwith future use for hotels or resorts for people through the world, also camping for\nholistice [sic] use, possible value $1 million.\u201d Applicant provided a copy of his current\nU.S. passport (Ex. 2).\nOn January 28, 2008, Applicant provided an affidavit to a government\ninvestigator in which he discussed his immigration to the U.S. as a refugee, and his\nservice in the Albanian military as a commander with last duty from January 1989 to\nMay 1990. He explained he was still a dual citizen of Albania and the U.S., but that he\nwas loyal to the U.S. and would not bear arms against the U.S. As for his property\n\n7\nownership, Applicant related he had inherited hundreds of acres of land in Albania on\nwhich stands a vacant house. He denied any obligations associated with his ownership\nof that foreign property, including any requirement to pay taxes. He expressed his intent\nto bequeath the property to his children on his death. Applicant denied he had used his\nbirth surname on any official documentation after he became a U.S. citizen. He\nexplained he had changed his name because he did not want to be identified when he\nreturned to Albania. Applicant denied traveling to Albania other than on U.S. documents\nand indicated that U.S. border officials had not always stamped his passport. Applicant\naverred he had traveled to Albania in July and October 2005 after he had submitted his\nSF 86. He indicated he had made some mistakes as to the dates of his foreign travel\nwhen he completed his SF 86, and he had inadvertently omitted a May 2001 trip to\nAlbania. Applicant related he continued to contact his mother daily, and that he had\nonce weekly to twice monthly contact with his siblings, and he last saw them in October\n2005 (Ex. 5).\nDuring the course of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, the government\nlearned that Applicant had been pulled over for speeding in May 2001 and that he\npresented at that time an operator\u2019s license under his birth name (Ex. 11). On January\n30, 2008, Applicant was re-interviewed by the investigator about his foreign travel and\nuse of his birth name after he had changed his name.  He maintained in an affidavit that\nbefore 1999, he used his U.S. permanent residency card and a permit to reenter the\nU.S. Applicant denied any intent to conceal information. Concerning his use of his birth\nname after he had changed his name in 1999, Applicant indicated that when he was\ncited for speeding in May 2001, he may have been using a driver\u2019s license under his\nbirth name and that could not recall when he changed it. Applicant denied he had\nopened any credit accounts using his birth name since 1999 or that he had applied for\nany credit under the name he acquired in 1999 (Ex. 6).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 5, 2007, revealed Applicant had made\nno progress toward resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6 3.a ($2,449 balance), \u00b6 3.b ($2,650\nbalance), \u00b6 3.c ($335 medical debt), or \u00b6 3.d ($39 telephone debt), and that he owed on\nother delinquent accounts: $905 for phone services placed for collection in August 2005\n(SOR \u00b6 3.f), $196 owed a satellite television provider since November 2005 (SOR \u00b6\n3.g), and $311 on a retail charge card closed in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 3.h) (Ex. 13). A\nmore recent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on February 14, 2008 (Ex. 12) showed the debts\nwere still outstanding with the balance of SOR \u00b6 3.a increasing to $2,482. Also a\ntelephone services provider had placed a $193 debt balance for collection in March\n2004 (SOR \u00b6 3.e).\nApplicant indicates the debts in SOR \u00b6 3.e. and \u00b6 3.f were for a telephone and/or\nservices he thought were free, and that he was unable to straighten it out with the\nservice provider due to his limited English (Tr. 108-10). He claims he incurred only\nabout $200 in consumer credit charges on SOR \u00b6 3.a before he lost the card (Tr. 112).\nApplicant made only one payment on the debt thereafter (Tr. 113). He does not\nrecognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.b or the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.c (Tr. 114). As for the\nsatellite television debt, Applicant bought a satellite dish at a local retail outlet. When he\n\n8\ncalled the provider to initiate service, he was told that he would be sent a new receiver.\nHe refused to pay for one because he did not need it, and when the creditor would not\nlisten to him, he did not pay for his second month of service that he received at his\nresidence (Tr. 116-17). Applicant maintains he incurred only about $125 of the charges\non the department store credit card account in SOR \u00b6 3.h and that he received no\nstatement of his account until his spouse called the creditor (Tr. 117-18). He had\nchanged addresses (\u201cI lost the address and I didn\u2019t know where I could pay it, and\nI\u2013And at that time, we were moving from the other house to our house.\u201d Tr. 129). In\nearly July 2008, an assignee collecting the debt offered to settle the $311.42 debt on\nreceipt of $124.57 (Ex. B). As of mid-July 2008, there is no proof that he paid on any of\nthe delinquent debts listed on his recent credit report. He does not intend to pay the\ntelephone debt of $905 even though he made the calls (\u201cBecause it looks to me not\nright, you know, and I said I\u2019m not going to try to pay nothing.\u201d Tr. 131).\nAs of mid-July 2008, Applicant had not renounced his Albanian citizenship,\nalthough he does not possess any document that currently identifies him as an Albanian\ncitizen (Tr. 88). He is not required to maintain his citizenship to keep his land in Albania.\nApplicant is considering building a small hotel someday on that land as a legacy for his\nchildren (Tr. 95). He continued to telephone his mother in Albania, usually every\nweekend. Applicant calls his brothers more often than once monthly. He speaks to his\nsisters about once a month. His eldest brother still works as a veterinarian for the\nAlbanian government although since his accident Applicant is not certain of his brother\u2019s\njob duties. His other brothers work in the dairy field (makes milk and cheese) and as a\ncarpenter. His two sisters do not work outside of the home. One takes care of her\nhusband who is paralyzed on one side and the other\u2019s husband guards restaurant\npremises at night to prevent break-ins (Tr. 77-80). Applicant has not spoken with his\nfriend the policeman in Albania for about two years (Tr. 83). \nApplicant\u2019s spouse visits her parents about once a year in Albania when she can\nafford to do so. She contacts her parents once weekly when she is able to reach them.\nShe speaks with her siblings in Albania about once a month. Her relatives in Albania\nhave cell phones (Tr. 36-38). Her father had been a truck driver in Albania until illness\nleft him unable to work. Her mother was employed on a farm. Her siblings support\nthemselves by working the land and their animals (Tr. 38-39). They have never worked\nfor the Albanian government (Tr. 39).\nApplicant and his spouse rent an apartment in the U.S. She does not drive.\nApplicant and his spouse have a good friend in the U.S. who has helped them deal with\ncreditors and helped them understand documents confusing to them as non-native\nEnglish speakers. She drives Applicant\u2019s spouse when needed because Applicant\u2019s\nspouse does not drive and she reviewed all the paperwork from DOHA about\nApplicant\u2019s clearance with him (Tr. 157). She believes Applicant and his spouse are\ngood people who don\u2019t quite understand at times (Tr. 22-25).\nA forklift operator with 33 years of experience at the company developed a close\nworking relationship with Applicant over the past five years. He considers Applicant to\n\n9\nbe a very professional and diligent installation mechanic. This coworker does not require\na clearance for his work but understands Applicant needs a clearance to perform some\nspecial hull treatment (Tr. 42-44).\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\nhistory, economic and political activities in Albania and its relationship to the U.S., I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts:\nAlbania is a parliamentary democracy that was controlled nearly continuously by\na succession of foreign powers until the mid-20th century, with only brief periods of self-\nrule. After World War II until the fall of communism in 1991, Albania adhered to a strict\nStalinist philosophy that led to isolation and underdevelopment. With the election of the\nfirst democratically elected president in 1992, Albania began a deliberate program of\neconomic and democratic reform, but unscrupulous investment and the collapse of\npyramid schemes led to armed revolt in 1997. Order was restored through international\nintervention, and in 1998 Albania ratified a new constitution guaranteeing the rule of law\nand protection of fundamental human rights. Since 2002, Albania has made significant\nprogress in transforming its economy into a market-oriented system, in instituting\ndemocratic reforms and rule of law initiatives, and in developing relations with its\nneighbors and the United States. Its primary long-term goals are to gain NATO and\nEuropean Union membership and to promote closer bilateral ties with its neighbors and\nthe U.S. Albania and the U.S. enjoy friendly and cooperate relations. Pro-U.S. sentiment\nis widespread among the Albanian population. Since fiscal year 1991, the U.S. has\nprovided Albania with more than $616 million in assistance not counting food aid.\nAlbania has aggressively worked with the U.S. and other countries to combat terrorism,\nbut the government and police forces face substantial challenges in fully enforcing\nborder security and in combating organized crime and corruption.\nAlbania generally respects the human rights of its citizens, although the country\ncontinues to experience problems in some areas, including societal \u201cblood feud\u201d killings,\nsecurity force abuse of prisoners and detainees, poor prison and pretrial detention\nconditions, police corruption, discrimination against women, children and minorities, and\nhuman trafficking. In 2007, domestic and international rights groups were allowed to\noperate in Albania without government restriction and government officials were\ncooperative and responsive to their findings. The government also respected legal\nprohibitions against arbitrary interference with personal privacy.\n \nThe Albanian government considers any person in Albania of Albanian parents to\nbe an Albanian citizen. Dual nationals may be subject to Albanian laws that impose\nspecial obligations. Male Albanian citizens are subject to compulsory service obligations\nand those guilty of draft evasion are subject to prosecution in Albania. The overall\nsecurity situation in Albania has improved in recent years although the crime rate\ncontinues to be high. A passport is required to enter Albania. A visa is not required to\nenter but an entry stamp is issued at the point of entry that is valid for a stay of up to 90\ndays. Foreign visitors are rarely targeted, but travel by U.S. government employees in\nthe northern administrative districts had been restricted to secure vehicles with escort\n\n10\ndue to possible threats by criminal elements against the physical safety of American\ncitizens in the area. As of September 2007, travel restrictions had been lifted for\novernight stays in the area where Applicant\u2019s family lives.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n11\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, siblings, and parents-in-law are resident citizens of Albania\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c). He has bonds of affection and/or obligation with his family\nmembers, which raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d). Applicant calls his\nmother every weekend, his brothers monthly, and his sisters every other month. He has\nreturned to Albania to visit them an estimated 20 times since immigrating to the U.S. in\nMarch 1991. \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Albania through his spouse also heighten the risk of undue\nforeign influence. Although his spouse became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 2007, she\nhas close bonds of affection and/or obligation with her parents and siblings in Albania.\nShe speaks with her parents by telephone about once weekly depending on whether\nshe is successful in making contact, and with her siblings about once a month. AG \u00b6\n7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status,\nif the relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d) applies.\nOn his father\u2019s death in 2005, Applicant inherited with his brothers hundreds of\nacres of land in Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.d). When asked to estimate the value of that foreign\nproperty asset, Applicant indicated it was worth in excess of $1 million USD. He testified\nat his hearing that he and his brothers have divided the property. It is not clear whether\nthe $1 million figure represents his share or the entire asset held with his brothers.\nEven so, it is a substantial foreign property interest that Applicant intends to retain and\n\nApplicant told a government investigator in April 2007 (Ex. 3) that in conjunction with his trips to Albania to\n5\nsee his family, he spent a week in Switzerland and France in September 1999, two weeks in Yugoslavia in\nJuly 2000, a few days in Germany in October 2000, and one week in Italy in October 2001 [sic]. However, he\nnow claims he stopped only one night in each country, but also that he stayed in Italy three or four nights (Tr,\n155). W hen asked about his prior admissions to having stayed as long as a week or two in these other\ncountries before proceeding to or from Albania, Applicant responded that he might not have understood the\nquestion posed to him by the investigator in April 2007, that \u201cMaybe I said one week or two weeks that I stayed\nin my country.\u201d (Tr. 156).\nApplicant initially indicated during his interview of April 2007 that he changed his name when he came to the\n6\nU.S. because he wanted a new start and feared that the U.S. would look down on him for his last name. This\ndoes not make sense given he changed his name some eight years after he came to the U.S. W hether out\nof fear because he was being reinterviewed, a failure to fully understand what was being asked due to\nlanguage issues, or some other reason, Applicant made other statements during that interview,  including that\nhe has not had close contact with his siblings over the past few years, that contradict his admissions in\nNovember 2005 and his hearing testimony. Applicant had not seen his siblings in person since his father\u2019s\nfuneral in 2005, but he had telephone contact with them.  \n12\nthen bequeath on his death to his children. Applicant and his spouse testified to\npotentially building a hotel on his land to enhance the legacy for their children. AG \u00b6 7(e)\n(\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s travels to Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.e) primarily implicate AG \u00b6 7(a) in that\nthey reflect the strength of his foreign family ties. There is no indication that Applicant\nhas engaged in conduct while in Albania that would fall within AG \u00b6 7(f) (\u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d)\nexcept perhaps maintaining his Albanian citizenship. According to the U.S. State\nDepartment, dual nationals may be subject to Albanian laws that impose special\nobligations. As for Applicant\u2019s travels to various European countries (SOR \u00b6 1.f), he\ncredibly explained that on each trip to Albania, he had a flight layover in a European\ncountry. He did not travel to all of the six countries listed (Yugoslavia, Italy, Germany,\nSwitzerland, Greece, and France) on each trip. Notwithstanding the discrepant\ninformation about the length of his layovers,  it is still difficult to see how a brief visit to a\n5\nEuropean country heightens his risk of foreign influence.\nThe government also alleges that an unacceptable risk of undue foreign\ninfluence exists because Applicant changed his name, and had his spouse change hers\nas well, because he did not want them to be identified as Albanians when they returned\nto Albania (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The evidence shows that Applicant took on a new name when\nhe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 1999.  Applicant and his spouse both\ntestified that he changed his name because he feared recognition by Albanian\nauthorities when in Albania.  This shows real concern on Applicant\u2019s part that pressure,\n6\ncoercion, or influence could be placed on him and/or his family members in Albania,\nperhaps because of what he had witnessed during Albania\u2019s communist past and the\ncircumstances under which he left Albania. Given Applicant traveled to Albania before\n\n13\n1999 using a U.S. issued entry permit issued under his birth name (see Ex. 8), one\ncould reasonably question his motivation for changing his name in 1999, but the U.S.\nState Department confirms that Albania was ruled by a series of short-lived socialist-led\ngovernments after the anarchy of 1997 until July 2002. Applicant credibly explained that\nhe still feared Albania could revert to its communist past during that period. As for his\nspouse taking on his new surname on their marriage in 2000, she had no choice but to\ntake his last name. At his urging, she changed her last name to his family name when\nshe became a U.S. citizen in 2007 as the strengthening of democracy in Albania had\nsufficiently alleviated his fears. At present, his name change is not seen as raising\nactionable foreign influence concerns.\nSimilarly, his possession of a record showing his military training in Albania (SOR\n\u00b6 1.h) in and of itself does not generate Guideline B concerns. Applicant explained that\nhe asked his brother to obtain the document for him as he wanted a record of his\ntraining/education (Tr. 98-100). None of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 are\npertinent to his mere possession of a document confirming past military service before\nhe came to the U.S.\nApplicant and his spouse have strong family ties to Albania that are being\nreinforced through frequent telephone contact and annual visits to Albania when their\nbudget permits. There is nothing untoward about their familial relationships. However,\ndespite being disabled, Applicant\u2019s oldest brother still works for the Albanian\ngovernment as a veterinarian (Tr. 78). It is unclear to what extent he is able to fulfill\nveterinary duties since he became disabled. As a dairy farmer and a carpenter\nrespectively, Applicant\u2019s other brothers do not hold positions that enhance the risk of\nApplicant being placed in the untenable position of having to choose between them and\nthe U.S. His sisters, with whom he has less frequent contact, do not work outside the\nhome. His mother is elderly and retired, his father-in-law had been a trucker before his\nillness, and his mother-in-law works on the farm as do his spouse\u2019s siblings. Nothing\nabout their duties has military, intelligence, or security implications. Yet, I am unable to\nfully apply AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d). Little is known about his relatives\u2019 associations and\nactivities in Albania, so the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely ruled\nout. It is also noted that while Albania and the U.S. enjoy good relations, it was not too\nlong ago that Albania was ruled by socialist-led governments.\nMoreover, Applicant remains tied to Albania through his ownership of hundreds\nof acres of land in Albania. The foreign influence risk presented by his significant foreign\nasset cannot be fully assessed without regard to concern for his heritage and perhaps\neven for his family members in Albania. Applicant testified that he and his brothers split\nup their inheritance, but he presented no evidence to show a legal division of the\nproperty. When asked whether they own property in Albania, Applicant\u2019s spouse\nresponded, \u201cWell, actually, my husband and his brothers, they do.\u201d (Tr. 34). She\ntestified further that the family home is located on Applicant\u2019s land (\u201cthey have a house,\n\n14\nan old house which his grandfather made it, his dad made it, with his mom, and they\nraised seven children there.\u201d), and that it is the family\u2019s current residence (Tr. 35). Even\nif Applicant owns only a share, and the house is vacant as claimed by him in January\n2008 (Ex. 5), he intends to keep the property interest as a legacy for his children, and\neven to possibly enhance its value through developing it for tourism purposes. AG \u00b6 8(f)\n(\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is\nsuch that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to\ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure the individual\u2019) does not apply.\nDespite the considerable risks Applicant took to flee Albania and immigrate to the\nU.S. when he had no family here and knew no English, he retains considerable ties to\nAlbania through his family and his property interest. He went back to Albania to get\nmarried in a relationship arranged between his brothers and his father-in-law. Applicant\ndoes not own any property in the U.S. of comparable value to his Albanian property. He\nand his spouse rent their apartment in the U.S. While his voluntary acquisition of U.S.\ncitizenship weighs in his favor, I am unable to conclude on the record presented that his\nties to the U.S. are so deep and longstanding to overcome his loyalties and obligations\nto his family members in Albania. AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d) does not apply.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for his security clearance in May 2005, he did not\ndisclose his previous service in the Albanian military from January 1987 to about May\n1990, or that he had worked as an artillery instructor for the Albanian government for\nabout six months. The government contends that Applicant deliberately did not list his\nforeign military service either in response to question 11, \u201cHave you ever served in the\nmilitary (\u201cIf yes, provide in chronological order your miliary history: begin with the most\nrecent period and include Reserves, National Guard, Merchant Marines, and Foreign\nMilitary Service.\u201d) (SOR \u00b6 2.c), to question 13, \u201cAre you now or have you ever been\nemployed by or acted as a consultant for a foreign government, firm, or agency?\u201d (SOR\n\u00b6 2.d), or question 14, \u201cHave you ever had any contact with a foreign government, its\nestablishments (embassies or consulates), or its representatives, whether inside of\noutside the U.S., other than on official U.S. Government business?\u201d Applicant had an\n\n15\nobligation to list his foreign military service in response to question 11.  The question\nunambiguously requires the reporting of any foreign military service. The evidence does\nnot establish that Applicant was required to report his military service in response to\nquestions 13 or 14. Civilian employment as an artillery instructor for the military would\nfall within the scope of question 13, but it is unclear whether he held the position in a\ncivilian capacity. As for question 14, it was not sufficiently shown that Applicant had any\ncontact with a foreign government outside of his military service, which is already\ncovered under question 11.\nAdditionally, Applicant did not disclose on his SF 86 any financial delinquencies\nin response to question 38 concerning any debts over 180 days delinquent in the last\nseven years (SOR \u00b6 2.f), or question 39, any debts currently over 90 days delinquent\n(SOR \u00b6 2.g). Checks of Applicant\u2019s credit revealed a $1,874 past due credit card\nbalance (SOR \u00b6 3.a) on an account charged off in about September 2001, a $1,772\npast due balance on a credit card account in collection since about December 2002\n(SOR \u00b6 3.b), a $39 telephone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 3.d) since June 2003, a $335\nmedical debt in collection since February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 3.c), and a telephone services\ndebt of $193 placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 3.e).\nThe knowing and willful omission/concealment of information required to be\nreported on an SF 86 falls within AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d). While Applicant has admitted that\ninformation was not disclosed, he denies the omissions were deliberate. Concerning his\nfailure to report his foreign military service, Applicant expressed his belief that the SF 86\nhad a ten-year scope (\u201cWhen I filled out application, it said I only had to go back last ten\nyears.\u201d Answer, Tr. 122). There is nothing in the record that corroborates Applicant\u2019s\nclaim that he was told to go back only ten years, although it also appears that he was\nfocused on events since he immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in 1991. His\nsubsequent disclosure of his military service when he was interviewed in November\n2005 shows he lacked the intent to conceal his foreign military record.\n As for his failure to list the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d, Applicant\nindicated that his wallet had been stolen and that he had not received any bills\n(Answer). When asked about the debts at his hearing, Applicant indicated he had not\nheard from the creditors until about two weeks ago, when he received a letter from the\ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 3.h (Tr. 127-28). When asked about his telephone debt in SOR \u00b6 3.e,\nwhich was referred for collection in March 2004, Applicant admits he made the\ntelephone calls, but he claims he did not understand the terms of the service and was\nunable to communicate with the creditors due to limited English. He admits he opened\nthe credit card account in SOR \u00b6 3.a and incurred about $300 in charges (Tr. 111).\nWhile he averred that the credit card was in his wallet that he had lost (\u201cI think I made\none payment after that, after I told them, they sent it on paper and I wrote something\ndown on that paper and I sent the paper to pay, and I sent that to them, and then after\nthat I didn\u2019t make any more payments. And I tried to call them to say to stop, and I said I\n\nAs previously noted in discussing the Guideline B concerns, Applicant was previously interviewed by the\n7\ninvestigator in April 2007, and he made several statements at that time that contradict not only his prior\nadmissions of November 2005 but also his hearing testimony. The government did not move to amend the\nSOR to allege any falsification of his April 2007 interview, although they are appropriate for considering\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access under the whole person concept.\n16\nlost it or something. I don\u2019t remember, I\u2019m not sure because it\u2019s a long time, and I didn\u2019t\ntry to put it in writing to them, to get all the story.\u201d Tr. 113), it is not clear that he knew in\nMay 2005 that he had an obligation to pay these debts. This bears negative implications\nfor his handling of his financial matters (see Guideline F, infra) but it falls short of\nestablishing knowing and willful concealment.\nNor has DOHA proven that Applicant deliberately falsified a written affidavit in\nJanuary 2008 when he claimed that he had utilized travel documents provided by the\nU.S. for travel (SOR \u00b6 2.a). While the passport in evidence does not include entry\nstamps for all of Applicant\u2019s listed travel to Albania, and the State Department reports\nthat an entry stamp will be issued at the point of entry (see Albania, Country Specific\nInformation, dated September 20, 2007), it is indeed possible that Applicant\u2019s U.S.\npassport was scanned but not stamped at the border. Applicant\u2019s U.S. passport bears\nstamps showing travel to Albania in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2005, and he furnished a re-\nentry permit issued by the U.S. in April 1998. The government presented no evidence\nthat he traveled on any foreign document, such as an Albanian passport, after he\nacquired his U.S. citizenship (see AG \u00b6 17(f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated\u201d)).\nThe government established that Applicant falsified his January 28, 2008,\naffidavit when he denied that he had used his birth name on any official documents after\nFebruary 1999 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The state police checked his traffic record on January 30,\n2008, and discovered that Applicant held a state driver\u2019s license under his birth name\nand that he had been cited for speeding in May 2001 (Ex. 11). Current information on\nrecord with the state as of January 30, 2008, failed to confirm that Applicant had ever\nchanged his name on his driver\u2019s license. Applicant can be expected to know what\nname was on his driver\u2019s license. When he was confronted about the discrepancy on\nJanuary 30, 2008, Applicant indicated that as of May 2001, he \u201cmay have still been\nusing\u201d a state driver\u2019s license issued in his former name, and that he could not recall\nwhen he changed it (Ex. 6). While there is a relevant distinction to be made between\nknowingly acquiring a driver\u2019s license under a former name and keeping an old license\nunder a former name until it was up for renewal, Applicant has not presented a credible\nexplanation to overcome the inference of falsification warranted by the evidence in this\ncase. In addition to the state\u2019s retrieval of the traffic record under Applicant\u2019s birth name\nin January 2008, Applicant made several inconsistent statements in April 2007 that\nundermine his overall credibility.  AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading\n7\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority or other official government representative\u201d) applies. None\nof the mitigating conditions are pertinent.\n\n17\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAvailable credit reports show that as of February 2008, Applicant owed\ndelinquent debt totaling about $7,112. He admitted all but $374 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d) of\nthe debt. While this is not an insurmountable financial burden, Applicant demonstrated\ndisregard of his financial obligations which is incompatible with holding a security\nclearance. He stopped making payments on his credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 3.a after he\napparently lost the card. He acknowledges he incurred the telephone charges in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f, and while he now claims to have no knowledge of the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.b,\nhe failed to show that it was not his responsibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d) are clearly implicated. His liability for the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.c was not\nsufficiently established, however.\nAssuming that Applicant was unaware of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c until\nthey became an issue for his clearance, he had made no payments on any of his debts\nas of his hearing. Rather, he showed an unwillingness to resolve those debt balances\nthat exceed the original charges. He does not intend to pay the telephone debt of $905\neven though he made the calls (\u201cBecause it looks to me not right, you know, and I said\nI\u2019m not going to try to pay nothing.\u201d Tr. 131). Whatever difficulty Applicant had with\ndealing with the creditors because of his limited English skills, it cannot justify his\ninattention to the accounts, especially when Applicant could call on the assistance of a\nfamily friend who had dealt with at least one creditor on his spouse\u2019s behalf. After the\nhearing, he presented documentation showing the creditor in \u00b6 3.h had offered to settle\nhis debt on receipt of two payments of $124.57 (Ex. B). The payment coupon was\nmissing so presumably Applicant kept it to send in a payment. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) has limited applicability in this case. His recent efforts to resolve the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 3.h warrant a favorable finding as to that debt, but it is not enough to\nensure that Applicant can be counted on to deal responsibly with his creditors in the\nfuture.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n18\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be in an\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s ties to Albania are familial and financial, and not\nsufficiently mitigated by countervailing strong bonds in the U.S. He has his employment\nhere but he retains his Albanian citizenship despite having fled Albania for refugee\nstatus in the West out of regard for his family. He and his spouse travel to Albania when\ntheir finances permit it. Applicant sent his spouse and children to Albania for three\nmonths last summer. In addition to the foreign influence concerns, doubts persist for his\njudgment and reliability because of his handling of his personal credit and his failure to\nprovide consistent responses at times to U.S. government inquiries, including those\nconcerning the date of his marriage, the duration of his stay in various foreign countries,\nthe reasons for changing his name, the dates of his father\u2019s death, when he lost his\nwallet, just to name a few. Even if due to inadequate recall or to a failure to understand\nthe importance of the clearance process, his inconsistencies cast doubt as to whether\nApplicant has the requisite good judgment and reliability that must be demanded of\nthose granted access to classified information. Based on the record before me, I am\nunable to conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant him access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant \n\n19\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 18, 2007; answered it on\nthe same day; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.

She is regarded by her employer as a diligent\nemployee whose ability to contribute to projects would be enhanced if she had a security\nclearance (AX A).\nApplicant was born and educated in the United States (U.S.) (Tr. 17). She\ngraduated from high school in 1993. She attended college and worked part time. She\ngraduated from a U.S. university in 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are living in the U.S. and are naturalized U.S. citizens. She\nhas one sister. While growing up in the U.S., Applicant visited El Salvador with her\nparents during holidays each year. (Tr. 18). \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in El Salvador. Her mother was born in Guatemala.\nHer father and mother keep in touch with their extended family outside the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s cousins are citizens and residents of El Salvador. Her uncles live\nthere and also her grandmother. (Tr. 37). Her uncles are professionals and are not\nconnected with the government. \nIn 1999, Applicant met a citizen and resident of El Salvador on line. They started\nto communicate by e-mail regularly. She met him in 1999. (Tr. 11). She visited him in\n2000. In 2002, Applicant lost her job. She decided to move to El Salvador. Her decision\nwas based on her relationship with her boyfriend and her love of the culture and history\nof the country. She intended to live there for the rest of her life.  She began the process\nof obtaining Salvadoran citizenship, with her father\u2019s help at the Salvadoran consulate in\nthe U.S. Her father provided his birth certificate to show that he was born in El Salvador.\n\nApplicant stopped dating him in 2003. She sent an occasional email after that because he owed her\n3\nmoney.\n3\nShe obtained recognition of and pursued citizenship in El Salvador. She did not vote in\nelections while there or receive any benefits. (GX 2). \nAfter living in El Salvador from February 2002 until December of 2002, Applicant\ndecided to return to the U.S. She missed the life in the U.S. Also, she was having\ndifficulty finding employment in El Salvador. Her relationship with her boyfriend ended.\nShe does not have any contact with him at this point.3\nApplicant now lives with her parents in the U.S. Her father owns a home in El\nSalvador and he and his wife plan to retire there perhaps in a year or so. The value of\nthe house is approximately $300,000 to $400,00. Applicant and her sister may inherit the\nhome at some point. (GX 2).\nApplicant does not keep in touch with any of her cousins or relatives in El\nSalvador. When she was living there she had some differences of opinions and now\nchooses not to contact them. (GX 2). She hears news of them from her father. (Tr. 19). \nIn October 2006, Applicant told a security investigator she was willing to renounce\nher Salvadoran citizenship. She does not possess a passport from that country. (GX 1).\nWhenever she traveled there or to any other country, she used her U.S. passport. She\nnever relinquished her U.S. citizenship.\nApplicant testified she would be willing to renounce her Salvadorian citizenship in\norder to work on preferred projects with her employer. She has no intention to live in El\nSalvador again. She does not believe a situation would arise where she would be under\npressure because she has no contact with the extended family and they are not involved\nin any political or government associations. \nApplicant was candid and straightforward at the hearing. She explained that when\nasked by the investigators if she could be put under duress, she does not recall replying\nyes. She also does not foresee that happening for any reason. She did honestly state\nthat she would not know what to do if someone threatened her parents but she knows\nher primary allegiance is to the U.S. (Tr. 33). \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about El Salvador. El Salvador is\na democratic republic governed by a president and an 84 member unicameral Legislative\nAssembly.  The Salvadoran economy continues to benefit from a commitment to free\nmarkets and careful fiscal management. U.S.-Salvadoran relations remain close and\nstrong. U.S. policy toward El Salvador seeks to promote the strengthening of El\nSalvador\u2019s democratic institutions and general growth. El Salvador has been a\n\nDepartment Counsel conceded that this case is not about heightened risk due to the country of El\n4\nSalvador. Nor is this a case about Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. (Tr. 12).\n4\ncommitted member of the coalition of nations fighting against terrorism and has also\nprovided a battalion to the efforts to bring stability to Iraq.4\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\n\n5\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s cousin and numerous other relatives are citizens\nand residents of El Salvador. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges Applicant\u2019s boyfriend is a\ncitizen and resident of El Salvador. (\u00b6 1.b).  Finally, it alleges Applicant traveled to El\nSalvador in 1999, 2000 and 2002 (\u00b6 1.c).  The security concern relating to Guideline B is\nset out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Finally, a security concern\nmay be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d). Applicant\u2019s extended family\n\n6\nlives in El Salvador. She did have a boyfriend in 1999-2003 who lived in El Salvador.\nBased on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the\nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to\nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has no contact with extended family members living\nin El Salvador. She does not intend to communicate with them due to her differences in\nopinion based on her 2002 visit. She no longer has a Salvadoran boyfriend. It has been\nalmost six years since her time spent in El Salvador. Thus, the above mitigating\nconditions apply in this case.\u00b6\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nAll members of Applicant\u2019s immediate family are citizens and residents of the U.S.\nHer cousins\u2019 specific occupation is not reflected in the record, but none of her extended\nfamily is connected to the Salvadoran government.\n\n7\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing showed her willingness to sever her ties to El\nSalvador. As such, her testimony supported this mitigating condition. \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant, born a U.S. citizen, pursued and became a citizen of\nEl Salvador in 2002 (\u00b6 2.a), she stands to inherit a home from her parents in El Salvador\n(\u00b6 2.b), she admitted that it was possible that she could be put under duress if pressure\nor threats were to be used against her extended family (\u00b6 2.c), and when questioned she\ndeclined to state whether she would betray U.S. secrets in order to help her extended\nfamily (\u00b6 2.d).  The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \u201cWhen an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the\nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security\nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17,\n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but\nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).\nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to\n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant does not possess a\nforeign passport, AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is not established because there is no evidence\nApplicant has a \u201ccurrent foreign passport.\u201d In fact she never had one.   \nNevertheless, the record established she took action to acquire or obtain\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship while she was an American citizen. Thus, the general\ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 10(b) is raised. \nBecause the disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 10(b) is raised, the burden shifted\nto Applicant to rebut, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts.  Several mitigating\nconditions are potentially relevant.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n11(a).  This mitigating condition is not fully established in this case.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant has stated\n\n8\nnumerous times, including at the hearing, that she is willing to renounce dual citizenship,\nif it is a condition for obtaining a clearance. Her testimony was sincere and credible on\nthis issue.\nAllegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d relate to the statements that Applicant made to\ninvestigators in 2006. The allegations concern her extended family. She has no contact\nwith them. She answered immediately at the hearing that she does not have any\naffiliation or affection for them since her 2002 trip.  Her comments were very candid\nconcerning her parents and any possible threats to them. While a concern may exist\nhypothetically, these allegations do not invoke any Disqualifying Conditions under\nForeign Preference. Moreover, the situation of threat is very unlikely to arise in regard to\nApplicant and the country of El Salvador. Her statements could be a factor for\nconsideration under the whole-person analysis. She was more honest than most people\nwould be when she said she loves her parents and would not want anyone to threaten\nthem. For all these reasons, the above allegations are found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in\nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, very intelligent adult.  She loves her family\nand is proud of her culture and heritage. She is a U.S. citizen who received her\neducation in the U.S. and lived her entire life in the U.S. except for a period of time in\n2002.  She believed she would pursue a romantic relationship and live in El Salvador.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct of potential concern under Guideline C resulted from choices made\nwhile young and during a previous romantic relationship. For the past six years she has\nlived and worked in the U.S., her home country. She does not intend to live in El\nSalvador and has not visited since 2002. I do not believe she is a threat to the United\n\n9\nStates, but rather an honest, hard-working young woman, who possibly made\nuninformed decisions early in her life, which she will never repeat.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and\nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign\npreference. Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Preference:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 29-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. 3 Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born in the U.S. with Nigerian heritage. Both of his parents are Nigerian citizens. Applicant established his Nigerian citizenship through proof of his birth to Nigerian citizens (R.T., at 41). While his mother resides in the U.S. on a work visa, she retains her Nigerian citizenship. Applicant returned to Nigeria with his parents to live at the age of four (R.T., at 36). Following two years of residence in Nigeria, he and his parents relocated to Great Britain. While in England, his only sister was born to his parents. Besides his sister, he has two brothers (ages 29 and 21, respectively). Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1996 and pursued his college education at recognized universities of higher learning. He received a bachelor of science degree in computer science in 2004 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 30, 39). Since March 2006, he has worked for his current employer as a software engineer (R.T., at 40). Applicant documents obtaining his U.S. passport in December 2004, and surrendering his Nigerian passport (due to expire in January 2010) to his facility security officer (FSO) in 2007 (see ex. B; R.T., at 82-83). He had held the Nigerian passport since birth, and renewed it in 2005 out of con",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn November 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 12, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 20, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 30, 2008, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nMay 29, 2008\n\n2\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 28, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is granted.\nBesides its three exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of five\ndocuments:  Background Note: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October 2007);\nConsular Information Sheet on Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (April 2007); Travel\nWarning: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October 2007); Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices - 2006, Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (March 2007); Congressional\nResearch Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues (April 2007).   \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).  Administrative notice is appropriate\nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Nigeria.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Nigeria\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a spouse who is a dual citizen\nof Nigeria and the U.S., residing in the U.S., (b) to have a mother who is a dual citizen of\nNigeria and the U.S., residing in the U.S., \u00a9) to have a father who is a citizen and\nresident of Nigeria, (d) to have a brother who is a citizen and resident of Nigeria, (e) to\nhave a sister who is citizen and resident of Nigeria, and (f) to have a father-in-law and\nmother-in-law who are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to be a U.S. citizen by birth who applied\nfor and was issued a Nigerian passport in January 2005, which is not set to expire until\nJanuary 2010.  \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations, but denied\nthat his spouse and mother are dual citizens.  He claimed that both his spouse and\nmother are citizens of Nigeria only.  He claimed his own dual citizenship is based solely\non his parents having Nigerian citizenship. Applicant stressed his willingness to resolve\nall of his Nigerian citizenship issues.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in the U.S. with Nigerian heritage.  Both of his parents are\nNigerian citizens.  Applicant established his Nigerian citizenship through proof of his birth\nto Nigerian citizens (R.T., at 41).  While his mother resides in the U.S. on a work visa,\nshe retains her Nigerian citizenship.  Applicant returned to Nigeria with his parents to live\nat the age of four (R.T., at 36).  Following two years of residence in Nigeria, he and his\nparents relocated to Great Britain.  While in England, his only sister was born to his\nparents.  Besides his sister, he has two brothers (ages 29 and 21, respectively).\n Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1996 and pursued his college education at\nrecognized universities of higher learning.  He received a bachelor of science degree in\ncomputer science in 2004 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 30, 39).  Since March 2006, he has worked\nfor his current employer as a software engineer (R.T., at 40).  Applicant documents\nobtaining his U.S. passport in December 2004, and surrendering his Nigerian passport\n(due to expire in January 2010) to his facility security officer (FSO) in 2007 (see ex. B;\nR.T., at 82-83).  He had held the Nigerian passport since birth, and renewed it in 2005\nout of concern he might want to use it again in the future (see ex. 3; R.T., at 83, 86-87).\nApplicant has expressed conditional willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship,\nshould this become necessary to obtain his security clearance (see ex. 3). \n Applicant traveled to Nigeria three times since immigrating to the U.S. in 1996: in\nDecember 1996, December 1997, and December 2004 (R.T., at 32-37).  Each time, he\nmade these trips to visit his family over the Christmas holidays, and never made contact\nwith the Nigerian government (R.T., at 34-35, 79).  Having only his Nigerian passport at\nthe time, Applicant used his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria in December 1996\n(see ex. 2).  Having just received his U.S. passport in December 1997, he used this\npassport to enter and exit Nigeria in 1997.  While he used his Nigerian passport to enter\nNigeria in 2004, records document that he used his U.S. passport to depart Nigeria on the\nsame trip (see ex. 2; R.T., at 80).  Applicant attributes his use of his U.S. passport on his\nreturn to both generally imposed Nigerian restrictions on exiting Nigeria without a visa and\nthe likely expiration of his Nigerian passport (R.T., at 33-34, 80).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria around 1996 (R.T., at 46).\nApplicant met his spouse in the U.S. and married her in 2001.  They have no children.\nShe has a degree in biology and work in a blood clinic for several years but is not\ncurrently working (R.T., at 46-47).  Applicant is separated from his wife, and while he is\nstill legally married to her, he is in the process of getting a divorce (see ex. A).  His wife\nowns real estate in the U.S., but has never petitioned for U.S. citizenship (R.T., at 47-48).\nShe spends about six months a year in Nigeria, and without her marriage to him,\nApplicant does not expect her to be able to obtain a green card to work in the U.S. or\nsuccessfully petition for permanent U.S. residency status (R.T., at 45).   His spouse has\nno known contacts with the Nigerian government (R.T., at 49).\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents are Nigerian citizens and residents. His mother has a\ngreen card and spends five to six months in the U.S. (R.T., at 30-31, 50).  His father has\n\n4\nreportedly applied for a green card to relocate in the U.S., but currently resides in Nigeria\n(R.T., at 30-31). Applicant\u2019 s father was born and raised in Nigeria, and is an engineer by\nprofession.  His father is not a prominent figure in Nigeria: He has never worked for the\nNigerian government, and has no ties to the government (R.T., at 74).  His father and\nmother own and manage real estate in Nigeria and are currently involved in a start-up fish\nor pig farm, which has yet to really take off (R.T., at 50-56).\nApplicant\u2019s father once served in the Nigerian military, retired as a one-star\ngeneral, and has a military pension (R.T., at 51-52).  His father, quite possibly, maintains\nsocial relationships with some of his old military colleagues (R.T., at 53).  Since retiring\nfrom the military, he has applied for a green card to relocate in the U.S. and helps\nApplicant\u2019s mother with her local business interests (R.T., at 50-56).  Applicant\u2019s father is\na member of the Igbo tribe (one of three principal tribes in Nigeria), whose homeland is\nsituated in Eastern Nigeria (R.T., at 59-60). The Igbos have no leadership hierarchy (R.T.,\nat 61-62).  The tribe of the currently dominant political party in Nigeria is the Yoruba tribe;\nthe Yoruba tribe is also the most affluent of the three major tribes extant in Nigeria.\nOperating in the Niger Delta region in Southern Nigeria, which has been such an ongoing\nsource of reported violence and terrorism in recent years over uneven distribution of oil\nrevenues (R.T., at 89-90), is a sub tribe of the Igbos which split off from the Ibos years\nago and have their own ethnic group  (R.T., at 60-61). \nIn years past, inter-tribal conflicts have erupted in Nigeria.  Applicant recollects a\nserious civil war in 1967 that was essentially waged along tribal lines between Igbos and\nHausas (R.T., at 62-63).  Tribal conflicts can reflect \u201ca whole divided rule concept,\u201d which\naccounts for the long history of military presidents in Nigeria who come from the most\naffluent and politically dominant Hausa tribe (R.T., at 63-66, 89-90).  Nigeria\u2019s former\npresident (Obasanjo) presents the exception: He belongs to the Yoruba tribe (R.T., at 63-\n64).\nApplicant\u2019s father has two sisters and several brothers.  Applicant has never met\nany of these aunts and uncles, and has no contact with them (R.T., at 57-58).  Applicant\ndid not maintain contact with his grandfather on his father\u2019s side (now deceased) who\nused to reside in the north of Nigeria and is believed to have been a civil servant (R.T., at\n57-58).  Applicant\u2019s father inherited property from his grandfather (R.T., at 56).  On his\nmother\u2019s side, his mother has one brother and a sister.  The brother resides in the U.S.\n(R.T., at 68).  Applicant has never been close to this uncle and maintains no contact with\nhim (R.T., at 69). Applicant\u2019s aunt from his mother\u2019s side is now a U.S. citizen and\noccasionally contacts him (R.T., at 70).\nApplicant\u2019s mother spends several months out of the year in  the U.S., and owns\nreal estate in this country (which she leases out), but returns to Nigeria for part of the year\nto look after her Nigerian business interests and see Applicant\u2019s father (R.T., at 48-50).\nLike his father, his mother was also born and raised in Nigeria and is a member of the Ibo\ntribe of Eastern Nigeria.  She has never worked for the Nigerian government and has no\nknown contacts with the government (R.T., at 49).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother immigrated to the U.S. in 1995 (one year before\nApplicant) and is a naturalized U.S. citizen (see ex. 1; R.T., at 30).  Applicant\u2019s youngest\nbrother resides with his parents in Nigeria, is a Nigerian citizen by birth, and is pursuing a\ncollege curriculum (R.T., at 32, 71-72).  Applicant\u2019s only sister resides in Great Britain,\nwhere she is pursuing graduate studies.  She is a dual citizen of Great Britain and Nigeria\n(R.T., at 31-32, 75-76).  None of his siblings have ever served in the Nigerian military or\nhave worked for the Nigerian government.  To the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge, none of\nhis siblings are at any known risk to coercion, pressure or influence by the Nigerian\ngovernment and/or military officials.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were both born in Nigeria and currently\nare citizens and residents of Nigeria (R.T., at 77-78). Neither has ever worked for the\nNigerian government.  They each have relatives who reside in Nigeria.\nApplicant has no friends or associates who are employed by any foreign\ngovernment.  He has no assets or financial interests in Nigeria or other foreign country;\nalbeit he could possibly inherit property from his parents (R.T., at 58, 67-68).  By contrast,\nall of his assets are in the U.S. (R.T., at 78)  He assures he voted in his first U.S. election\nin 2004 and intends to vote in this year\u2019s presidential primary and general election (R.T.,\nat 87-88).  \nApplicant maintains regular bi-monthly contacts (either by telephone of e-mail) with\nhis parents (R.T., at 66-67).  His parents are financially independent and do not rely on\nApplicant for any financial support.  He has regular contact, too, with his sister who\nexpects to complete her graduate studies in Great Britain this year and will likely settle in\nthat country (R.T., at 76-77).\nBesides his parents and his sister, Applicant maintains contact with his aunt (a\ndual U.S./Nigerian citizen) and younger brother who still resides in Nigeria (R.T., at 74).\nHowever, he has much less telephone contact with these other family members (R.T., at\n77).   Applicant has never had much contact with his in-laws (R.T., at 77), and does not\nexpect to maintain any contact at all in the wake of his pending divorce.  Applicant has no\nreason to believe that any members of his wife\u2019s family who reside in Nigeria are at any\nrisk to pressure or influence from the Nigerian government.\nNigeria\u2019s country status\nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa that gained its independence from\nGreat Britain in 1960 as a federation of three regions (northern, western and eastern).\nToday, Nigeria comprises 36 states and the capital territory of Lagos.  It has a population\nbase of 140 million (see Background Note: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October\n2007).  Since gaining its independence, Nigeria has experienced periods of political\ninstability, economic crises, ethnic and religious conflict, extreme poverty, a lack of law\nand order, judicial corruption, and military coups (Congressional Research Service, CRS\nReport for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues (April 2007)).  Nigeria has been ruled by its\n\n6\nmilitary for 28 of its 43 years since independence.  The country returned to civilian rule in\nMay 1999 (see id., at 1-3).\nBesides being the largest trading partner of the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa, with\ntotal two-way trade valued at $30.8 billion, Nigeria remains Africa\u2019s largest oil\nproducer.State Department reports confirm that Nigeria\u2019s bilateral relationship with the\nU.S. has continued to improve (see id., at 11).  The trade balance favors, though,\nsignificantly favors Nigeria due to its oil exports, which continue to be substantial, \n Insurgent activities have brought turmoil to the Niger Delta region\u2019s oil producing\nsector over perceived uneven and/or unfair oil revenue distribution (see Background\nNote: Nigeria, supra, at 7).  In response to numerous reports of kidnaping for ransom of\npersons associated with the petroleum sector (including U.S. citizens), the U.S. State\nDepartment has updated its Travel Warning for Nigeria in October 2007 (see Travel\nWarning: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October 2007)).  The Travel Warning\nadvises U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of\nsecurity in the Niger Delta region (see id; Consular Information Sheet on Nigeria, U.S.\nDepartment of State (April 2007)).  The Travel Warning states, too, that al-Qaeda\nleadership operating in the region has expressed interest in overthrowing the ruling\nauthorities (see id., at 1).\nCommenting on news reports of ransom kidnaping of oil sector personnel in recent\nyears, Applicant attributes the actions to hatched schemes by radical groups in the oil-rich\nDelta region to extort money out of foreign governments (R.T., at 92).  Applicant\nacknowledged the created tensions with the U.S. that these kidnappings have induced\nand the long-term impacts these action shave on Nigeria\u2019s oil industry in general.\nDespite its democratic government and an established judiciary, Nigeria\u2019s\ngovernment suffers from a poor human rights record (see  Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices - 2006, Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (March 2007)).  The State\nDepartment\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices documents Nigerian\ngovernment officials at all levels committing serious abuses against Nigeria\u2019s citizens and\nvisitors.  Sani Abacha\u2019s regime was especially repressive. Under his regime, all branches\nof the security forces committed serious human rights abuses (id., at 5).  Documented\nabuses by security forces include politically motivated, extrajudicial killings as well as\ntorture and arbitrary arrest (see id.).  Instability and incidents of armed conflicts between\nreligious, political, and ethnic factions comprising Muslim, Christian and other ethnic\ngroups have marked Nigeria\u2019s political landscape (see Travel Warning: Nigeria, supra, at\n1).  Since Abacha\u2019s death in June 1998, his replacements have released most known\ncivilian political detainees (see Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 5).  \nIn the areas of peace and security, the U.S. has supported peacekeeping and\nsimulation centers at Nigeria\u2019s armed forces staff college (Africa\u2019s only such center), while\npromoting effective civilian oversight of the military and its adherence to human rights\nnorms (see  Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 12).  In addition to its efforts aimed at\nfostering maritime cooperation with security services in the Niger Delta region, the U.S.\n\n7\nhas continued to support the European union\u2019s leading role in helping Nigeria fight\ncorruption, organized criminal elements, drug traffickers, and terrorists (see id.).  Reports\nconfirm that Nigeria remains a member in good standing of ECOWAS, a West-African\ntrade union and a constructive trading partner with the U.S. (see id.). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nconcerns are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in\nU.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited\nto, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  See\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) B, \u00b6 6.\nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  See\nAG C, \u00b6 9.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\n\n8\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven\nhave a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nANALYSIS\nApplicant presents as a conscientious software engineer for a defense contractor\nwho after being born and raised in Nigeria, immigrated to the U.S. in 1996 to seek better\neconomic opportunities.  Claiming the need for a Nigerian passport to aid him in traveling\nback to Nigeria, he retained his Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen and\nobtaining a U.S. passport. \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail country allegiance assessments and\ninvite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the\nforeign country over the interests of the U.S.  In a different vein, the continued residence of\nhis immediate family members (his parents and younger brother) and his wife\u2019s immediate\nfamily members in Nigeria raise potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future\npressure or duress that could result in the compromise of classified information.  The\nissues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant\u2019s preference for a foreign country over the\nU.S. and the potential for members of Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family being\nplaced at risk to pressure or duress to induce Applicant to divulge classified information he\nmight be privy to.\nForeign Preference\nBy virtue of his birth in the United States to parents of Nigerian descent and\ncitizenship, Applicant was endowed with Nigerian citizenship through his parents.  This\ncitizenship could not be lost except by express renunciation, approved by the Nigerian\n\n9\nGovernment, which Applicant has never explored. To the contrary, three years ago he\napplied for the renewal of his Nigerian passport (an active exercise of dual citizenship) and\nreceived one.  He has never used his renewed Nigerian passport, and has since\nsurrendered it to his employer\u2019s FSO.  He has pledged never to apply for a Nigerian\npassport again, and will always use his U.S. passport when he travels on family matters.\nRisks of his being taken hostage behind Nigerian lines and denied the customary\ndiplomatic intercession made available to U.S. citizens traveling on US passports are\nsignificantly reduced now that he has surrendered his Nigerian passport. \nThe Appeal Board has tended to blur convenience/force of law distinctions when\nappraising legal necessity passport usage in multiple return to country situations (as here).\nSee ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. February 8, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0254 (App.\nBd. February 16, 2000). To be sure, his initial exercise of choice to renew and retain his\nNigerian passport out of desire to preserve his options when traveling to Nigeria after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen  to see his family is itself a voluntary election, not a submission to\nlegal compulsion, when made in juxtaposition to known security risks extant in traveling to\na country that lacks acceptable security protections against terrorists operating within the\ncountry.  By applying for renewal of a Nigerian passport, Applicant provides some indicia\nof a conscious preference for Nigeria, even if it was for perfectly logical and\nunderstandable reasons: wanting to see his family members. \nSo, even Applicant\u2019s limited exercise of dual citizenship is sufficient under the facts\nof this case to invoke one disqualifying condition of the Guidelines covering foreign\npreference: DC 10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member\n(inclusive of possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  Concerns over continued Applicant\npreference for Nigeria through his continued possession and use of his Nigerian passport\nare considerable for so long as he retained his Nigerian passport and dual Nigerian\ncitizenship.\nApplicant, though, has documented his surrendering his Nigerian passport and\nassures his preference is for the U.S.  He has no assets in Nigeria and has never voted in\na Nigerian election, served in Nigeria\u2019s military, or worked for Nigeria\u2019s government. By\ncontrast, all of his assets and financial interests are situated in the U.S., and he recently\nvoted in a U.S. election.  And in his case, his dual citizenship with Nigeria is based solely\non his parents\u2019 Nigerian citizenship and his birth in that country.  Based on these\nconsiderations, one mitigating condition is fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s case: MC 11(e),\n\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated.\u201d  Another mitigating condition warrants some consideration, too, in\nlight of his expressed interest in renouncing his Nigerian citizenship: MC 11(b), \u201cthe\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  However, because\nhe conditioned his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship on his gaining\nclearance access, the mitigating condition has only limited application. \n\n10\nTwo potentially applicable mitigating conditions may not be considered.  Having\nexercised a privilege of his dual Nigerian citizenship by renewing his Nigerian passport in\n2005, Applicant is not in a position to claim the mitigation benefits of these two mitigating\nconditions: MC 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country,\u201d and MC 11(c), \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of\nforeign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor.\u201d\nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship\nexercise and demonstrated meaningful mitigation efforts, conclusions warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s exhibited active dual citizenship by his renewing and using a Nigerian passport\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen is mitigated.  His demonstrated mitigation commitments\nsatisfy expressed Appeal Board burden requirements relative to successful discounting\nresidual security risks that exist with his continued exercise of dual Nigerian citizenship.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a of Guideline C. \nForeign Influence\nSecurity concerns are also raised over the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family\n(i.e., his parents and brother) and in-laws who are citizens and residents of Nigeria, a\ncountry historically plagued by military coups, domestic turmoil, and a poor human rights\nrecord.  Department Counsel urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s parents,\nbrother and in-laws residing in Nigeria might be subject to undue foreign influence by\nNigerian government and military authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control.  Because Applicant\u2019s immediate family members and in-laws reside\nin Nigeria, they present potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The\ncitizenship/residence status of these immediate family members and in-laws in Nigeria\npose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence\nthat could compromise sensitive or classified information under Applicant's possession\nand/or control. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s father has prior military service (although aged for the most\npart), some consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government,\nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted as well.  Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with his parents and brother residing in Nigeria afford him some potential for\naccessing Nigerian officials who might be interested in proprietary, sensitive, or even\nclassified information that Applicant is privy to.\n\n11\n Because of the paucity of contacts Applicant has historically had with his in-laws,\nand even less likelihood of future contact in view of his pending divorce situation, potential\nrisks associated with his in-laws residing in Nigeria must be considerably discounted.\nMoreover, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members have any identified affiliations or\ncontacts with Nigerian  officials currently known to be associated with intelligence or\nmilitary organizations interested in collecting proprietary or sensitive information in the U.S.\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family and in-laws residing in Nigeria have any (a) political affiliations with\nNigeria\u2019s government or military, (b) history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence, or (c) appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Applicant\u2019s mother has business\ninterests in Nigeria and the U.S. and his father had military experience in Nigeria for many\nyears before he retired with a military pension.  With the exception of his father\u2019s\ngovernment-funded pension benefit, his parents have no financial interests associated with\nthe Nigerian government.  While his brother is privately employed in Nigeria, he, too, has\nlittle \nvisible \nconnections \nwith \nthe \nNigerian \ngovernment \nor \nmilitary/intelligence\nestablishment.  \nNigeria, although a country reported to have a history of military coups and human\nrights violations, enjoys a non-hostile relationship with the U.S., and is a democratic\ngovernment with some respect for the rule of law in the areas of foreign trade and\ncommerce.  While Nigeria has a documented record of turmoil and kidnaping in its oil-rich\nNiger Delta region, it generally enjoys stable diplomatic and trade relationships with the\nU.S. \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Nigeria. \nNigeria remains a non-hostile trading partner of the U.S. and is a country whose\ndemocratic institutions are not wholly incompatible with our own traditions and respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law.  Unlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do\ntake into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important\nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency\nelsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the\nparticular foreign regime involved do matter.  Nigeria, while reported to have human rights\nand insurgency issues in its Niger Delta region, is still a country with no known recent\nhistory of government-sponsored hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue\ninfluence against family members to obtain either classified information, or unclassified\neconomic and proprietary data. \n\n12\nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's relatives in\nNigeria , any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary\ndata out of Applicant through his family members residing in Nigeria is quite remote.\nApplicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a),\n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d \nMC (8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or\nthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d has application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Since relocating to the U.S. in\n1996, Applicant has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the\nU.S.  Whatever potential conflicts he may have through his dual Nigerian citizenship and\ncontacts with his family members in Nigeria have been more than counterbalanced by his\ndemonstrated U.S. citizenship responsibilities.  \nAppraising risks associated with Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship status with Nigeria, the\npresence of Applicant family members in Nigeria, his past family visits to Nigeria, and his\nregular contacts with these family members, any risk of undue foreign influence on\nApplicant and/or his parents, siblings, and to an even lesser extent, his in-laws, who reside\nin Nigeria would appear to be insubstantial, and clearly not of the magnitude that could\nmake them subject to a heightened security risk of coercion, pressure or compromise\nunder Guideline B.\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflict\nof interests with his Nigerian family members. Not only is Applicant a U.S. citizen by birth\nand later received his college training at recognized American colleges following his\nrelocation here, but he has made every effort to work, save, and pursue his financial\ninterests exclusively in the U.S. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on any of his immediate family members and in-laws would appear to be minimal.\nBy all reasonable accounts of the presented record,  Applicant has no visible conflicts of\ninterest with Nigerian citizen/residents or property interests in Nigeria that could be at risk\nto exploitation or compromise by Nigerian military or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members\nand in-laws residing in Nigeria are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments\nabout Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial\n\n13\nrelationships in Nigeria.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole,\nincluding each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative\nProcess of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f::\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 9, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January\n\nThe Judge ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the SOR allegations under Guidelines E and J.  Those favorable\n1\nrulings are not at issue on appeal.\n9, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision.  \n1\nApplicant asserts that he is a responsible, trustworthy person, and the fact that he has\nfinancial problems does not mean that he would jeopardize his security clearance.  Applicant\nmaintains that he is acting responsibly to correct his debt delinquencies and is making payments to\nretire his debts.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.  \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He concluded that, notwithstanding the partial applicability of two Guideline\nF Mitigating Factors, the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s repayment efforts\nrepresent a good start, but his record of repayment has been skimpy to date and Applicant has made\nlittle progress in light of the overall size of his indebtedness.  These conclusions are reasonably\nsupported by the record.  The Judge also considered Applicant\u2019s service to the country in his whole\nperson analysis.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).

In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 9, 2008. The SOR is\nJanuary 9, 2009\n\n2\nequivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.\nThe issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations, Guideline E\nfor personal conduct, and Guideline J for criminal conduct. The allegations under the\nthree guidelines all center around Applicant\u2019s indebtedness. \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 3, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. It took place as scheduled pursuant to written notice on November\n19, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 26, 2008. \nThe record was left open until December 3, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner\nand those matters (as described in Applicant\u2019s cover letter) are admitted, without\nobjections, as Exhibit B. In addition, he submitted two letters concerning debts not\nalleged in the SOR, but which he has successfully resolved. Those documents are\nadmitted, without objections, as Exhibit C.  \nApplicant submitted additional documentary evidence, which was mailed on or\nabout December 18, 2008. Although past the deadline, department counsel had no\nobjections. Those matters (as described in Applicant\u2019s cover letter) are admitted as\nExhibit D. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes nine creditors the total\nsum of approximately $70,000 in delinquent debt. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged\nthat Applicant gave deliberately false answers in response to two questions about his\nfinancial record when he completed a security-clearance application. Under Guideline J,\nthe SOR cross-alleged the falsification allegations as criminal conduct in violation of\nTitle 18 U.S.C. 1001 (making a false statement within the jurisdiction of a federal\nagency). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts except for the debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, to which he claimed it was included in the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.f. He\ndenied the falsification allegations and the related criminal conduct allegation. Based on\nthe record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been\nemployed as a field service representative working in communications since January\n2007. His annual salary is about $49,000. He has been married since 1981. He and his\nwife have two children, ages 18 and 16. His wife has been unemployed for various\nreasons, including medical, since about 2003. She is now seeking employment. \nHis employment history includes about 23 years of military service in the U.S.\nArmy (Exhibit B\u2013DD Forms 214). He first served as an enlisted soldier from 1976 to\n1991 and he reached the grade of sergeant first class. He then served as a warrant\nofficer from 1991 to 1999 when he retired at the grade of chief warrant officer two. He\n\n Based on these findings, I conclude that Applicant did not give deliberately false answers. Accordingly, the\n2\npersonal conduct and criminal conduct allegations are decided in Applicant\u2019s favor and will not be discussed\nfurther. \n This summary is based on Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and D, and his hearing testimony. \n3\n3\nworked in communications and he held a security clearance, to include a top-secret\nclearance (Exhibit B\u2013DA Form 873).\nApplicant has worked for federal contractors since retiring from the Army in\nOctober 1999. He worked as field engineer at different locations, to include overseas,\nfrom January 2000 to January 2006. He was then unemployed until he started his\ncurrent employment in January 2007. \nHe completed a security-clearance application in February 2007 (Exhibit 1). He\nwas required to answer various questions about his background, to include his financial\nrecord. He denied having been over 180 days delinquent on any debts during the last\nseven years in response to Question 28a. Likewise, he denied that he was currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debts in response to Question 28b. Applicant did not\nreport any delinquencies because he was unaware of any, as his wife had primary\nresponsibility for bill paying and household financial matters. In a written statement, his\nwife admitted overspending and failing to inform him of their delinquent accounts\n(Exhibit A).  \n2\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The delinquent debts alleged in the\nSOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the admitted evidence (Exhibits 2,\n3, 4, and 5). To date, Applicant has not paid-in-full, settled, or otherwise resolved any of\nthe alleged debts. But he and his wife were successful in establishing repayment plans\nfor many of the debts. In addition, they paid-in-full one debt not alleged in the SOR, and\nthey successfully disputed another debt not alleged in the SOR (Exhibit C). \nThe status of the nine debts in the SOR is summarized in the following table.3\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$7,633 collection account.\nIn repayment plan since July 2008 with\nmonthly payments of $250 (Exhibit A,\nTab A).

The first delinquency is a past-due account owed to the federal\ngovernment (the Army & Air Force Exchange Service or AAFES) in the amount of\n$7,857 with a demand for a minimum monthly payment of $654 (Exhibit A, Tab L).\nApplicant was unable to meet that demand and responded with a monthly payment of\n$50 in November 2008, which is in addition to a monthly payment of $77 via deduction\nor offset from his retired pay. As of December 2008, the balance was $7,887 (Exhibit D,\nTab 3). \nThe second delinquency is a collection account with a balance of $11,638 as of\nOctober 2008 (Exhibit A, Tab K). The creditor offered Applicant a 40% discount to settle\nby making a lump-sum payment. Unable to do so, Applicant responded by agreeing to\n\n Department of Navy v.

His most recent payment was on November 28, 2008\n(Exhibit D, Tab 3). \nApplicant receives retired pay of $2,496 monthly (gross), which is nearly $30,000\nannually (Exhibit A\u2013retiree account statement). Review of the account statement shows,\nhowever, that Applicant takes home very little. The September 2008 account statement\nshows a taxable income of $1,903, multiple allotments for $1,665, and a net pay of\n$17.41. \nApplicant and his wife sold a home in about January 2008 (Tr. 67\u201368). They\nmade a profit of about $20,000. Applicant\u2019s wife gave some of the money to her\nparents, and Applicant and his wife used some of it to pay bills and debts. About $5,000\nor $6,000 remained after doing so. Now, Applicant estimates having about $8,000 in the\nbank, but no other financial assets other than personal property.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n6\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n7\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and two justify discussion. The first is\nMC 2, which concerns events or circumstances largely beyond a person\u2019s control. The\nsecond is MC 4, which concerns initiating a good-faith effort to repay. Each is discussed\nbelow. \nApplicant receives credit in mitigation under MC 2 because his financial problems\nresulted from events or circumstances largely beyond his control. The primary events or\ncircumstances were as follows: (1) his wife\u2019s unemployment since 2003; (2) his\nunemployment in 2006; and (3) his wife\u2019s overspending and withholding of information\nabout their finances. Taken together, these events or circumstances had a snowball or\ncumulative effect, the consequences of which Applicant is still experiencing. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132 (setting forth nine factors to consider). \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d).\n20\n8\nIn addition, Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He returned to\nfull-time employment in January 2007, and, once being fully aware of the situation, has\nworked with his wife to address his indebtedness. Given the particular facts of this case,\nApplicant has acted responsibly under difficult circumstances.  \nApplicant also receives credit under MC 4 due to his efforts to repay creditors as\ndetailed in the table above. His actions, although at the beginning stages, are sufficient\nto qualify as initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline.\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept,  this case presents both\n19\ndisqualifying and mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing.\nApplicant is in a difficult spot facing a mountain of debt. The six delinquent accounts in\nrepayment plans plus the two other delinquent accounts (not alleged in the SOR)\namount to approximately $81,836 in delinquent debt. He has a daunting task ahead of\nhim with limited financial means and a spouse with a history of overspending. Although\nhe presented documentary evidence of his efforts to resolve his indebtedness, he did\nnot present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns. His efforts to date\nare a good start, but he has made little progress in light of the size of his indebtedness.\nHis track record of repayment at this point is skimpy and not sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept (to include his many years of honorable military service) was\ngiven due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision.\nIndeed, looking forward to the next 12 to 24 months, it is highly unlikely that he will\nsuccessfully resolve his financial problems.  This case is decided against Applicant. \n20\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The\n1\nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline\nE (personal conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by\nDOHA on November 26, 2007. She was notified by DOHA that her response was\nconsidered incomplete, by letter dated December 5, 2007, and she was being provided an\nadditional ten days to submit a complete response. Applicant submitted a completed\nresponse that was received by DOHA on December 14, 2007. Applicant admitted the\nallegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.g. She denied the\nremaining allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without a\nhearing. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJuly 3, 2008\n\n Applicant\u2019s written request for a hearing was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I, and made\n2\npart of the record.\n2\nApplicant was provided a copy of a File of Relevant Material (FORM) that had been\nprepared by Department Counsel. After receiving the FORM, Applicant submitted a written\nrequest for a hearing, dated February 4, 2008, that was accepted by DOHA.  \n2\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 14, 2008, and\nreassigned to me on April 21, 2008, to be heard in conjunction with other cases I had\nscheduled in the same city. A notice of hearing was issued on May 7, 2008, scheduling the\nhearing for June 3, 2008. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government\nsubmitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4,\nand admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, called one witness to\ntestify on her behalf, and submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\nwas received on June 18, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 34 years old, She is employed by a staffing agency and assigned under\na contract to a defense contractor where she works as a claims associate. She first began\nworking full-time with the defense contractor in September 1998, but was laid off in\nSeptember 2004. She was recalled by the defense contractor to work part-time (32 hours\nper week) from October 2004 to March 2005. She was unemployed from March 2005 to\nDecember 2005. She worked as a receptionist outside the defense industry from January\n2006 to in or about September 2006, when she again began working full-time for the\ndefense contractor.\nApplicant is single and has three children, ages 13, 12, and 3. The same man is the\nfather of all three children. She has never sought court-ordered child support for the\nchildren from their father, but he works in the construction field and voluntarily provides her\nwith $180 every two weeks as support and buys the children clothing and other necessities.\nApplicant\u2019s net salary is $707 every two weeks. During periods of unemployment, she\nreceived unemployment compensation in the amount of $304 per week.  \nThe SOR alleges two judgments, totaling $1,437, a collection account, owing in the\namount of $55, and the deficits owing after the resale of two automobiles that were\nrepossessed from Applicant, totaling $21,423. In her response to the SOR, Applicant\nclaimed to have made some payments on these debts, but she did not submit any\ndocumentation in support of those claims. Applicant certainly has not made any recent\npayment on any of these debts nor has she taken any other action to attempt to resolve\nthem. All of these debts were incurred by Applicant while she was employed full-time by\nthe defense contractor and before she was laid off in September 2004.\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n3\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n4\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n5\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n6\n3\nThe SOR alleges another account, owing in the amount of $1,291, that was placed\nfor collection after Applicant was laid off in September 2004. She began making $161 per\nmonth payments to satisfy that account in February 2008, and had made three payments\nas of the date of the hearing. The remaining balance owing at that time was $807.50.\nApplicant owned a mobile home on which she had an adjustable rate mortgage. She\nwas unable to make the loan payments as the interest rate increased on the mortgage, and\nshe was unsuccessful in an effort to negotiate a fixed interest rate mortgage with the\ncompany holding the mortgage. As a result, the mobile home was repossessed in or about\nJuly 2001. She has not been contacted by the company since the repossession and is\nunaware if there was any deficit owing after the mobile home was resold.\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) in\nSeptember 2006. In response to questions inquiring about judgments having been\nrendered against her in the preceding seven years and whether she was then over 180\ndays delinquent on any financial obligation, she answered \u201cNo\u201d. Both answers were untrue.\nApplicant explained she did not report the judgments because she never received\nany notice from the courts or creditors that a judgment had been entered against her.\nThere is no record evidence to contradict those assertions. Applicant claimed she did not\nreport the other delinquent debts because all but one were many years old and she thought\nthe question was only asking about more current debts, and she didn\u2019t realize the more\nrecent account was a student loan on which she had to make monthly payments. \n  \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n3\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.4\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n5\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.6\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\n\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n4\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.7\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n8\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n9\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has a number of delinquent accounts, totalling over $21,000, that were\nsubmitted for collection and/or resulted in a judgment being entered against her.\nAdditionally, a mobile home she was purchasing was foreclosed on due to her inability to\nmake the required loan payments. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nAll but one of the accounts listed in the SOR have been delinquent for many years.\nApplicant was employed full-time before the accounts became delinquent and for at least\nseveral years afterwards. She has only recently begun to make payments on the account\nthat was placed for collection in 2006, and has not taken any action to resolve any of the\nother accounts. Accordingly, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a): the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 20(d): the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not apply in this\n\n5\ncase. The remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts in this case.\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the (sensitive position eligibility) process or any failure to cooperate with\nthe (sensitive position eligibility) process.\nApplicant submitted an SF 85P in September 2006, and in response to questions\ninquiring about judgments having been rendered against her in the preceding seven years\nand whether she was then over 180 days delinquent on any financial obligation she\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d. Both answers were untrue. There is no record evidence to contradict her\nassertion that she never received notice from the courts or creditors about the judgments\nand she therefore unaware of them when she submitted the SF 85P. SOR subparagraph\n2.a is decided for Applicant.\nHowever, her claims that she did not report most of the delinquent debts because\nthey were too old and she did not report the newer delinquent debt because she didn\u2019t\nrealize it was a student loan on which she had to make monthly payments are not credible.\nIn making that determination, I have considered the substance of her testimony, her\nappearance and demeanor while testifying, and the nature of the debts in question. She\nis clearly an intelligent woman with the capacity to read and understand the questions at\nissue and discern the information she was required to furnish. DC 16(a): deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, of similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies. I have\nconsidered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and find none apply. Guideline E is\ndecided against Applicant.   \n \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. She has not\novercome the case against her nor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to sensitive\ninformation. Guidelines F and E are decided against Applicant.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $2,619 to $18,000 for about $64,000 in total. In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations, provided a general explanation for her situation, and indicated that each of the seven debts had been included in a recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since 1989 as the office administrator/manger and as the facility security manager (FSO) (Exhibit D). She has held a top-secret security clearance for many years and received training to perform the FSO duties. Since about November 2006, she has worked as the contracts assistant supporting a team of contracting 3 officers and specialists. As such, she no longer performs FSO duties. Her current annual gross salary is about $58,000 (Exhibit P). Applicant\u2019s financial problems, which she does not dispute, stem from a difficult period of her nearly 20-year marriage, which ended in divorce in February 2008 (Exhibit Q). Before the difficulties, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was strong enough that in approximately 2004 she and her husband gave $40,000 to their daughter for a down payment on a house (Tr. 69\u201370).

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 30, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nMarch 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 20, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on January 31, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on February 7,\n2008.\nThe record was left open until February 15, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The post-\nhearing matters are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit I\u2013cover letter; (2) Exhibit J\u2013bank\nletter, dated January 17, 2008; (3) Exhibit K\u2013bank letter, dated January 17, 2008; (4)\nExhibit L\u2013bankruptcy court order; (5) Exhibit M\u2013bankruptcy court confirmation order; (6)\nExhibit N\u2013Chapter 13 plan; (7) Exhibit O\u2013Chapter 13 Schedules D and F; (8) Exhibit\nP\u2013recent earnings statement; and (9) Exhibit Q\u2013Applicant\u2019s final decree of divorce,\ndated February 4, 2008. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for\nApplicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nThe SOR was amended, without objections, to conform with the evidence by\nadding subparagraph 1.h in the following words and figures: \u201cYou filed a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy case in October 2007\u201d (Tr. 121\u2013123).\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $2,619\nto $18,000 for about $64,000 in total. In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nthe factual allegations, provided a general explanation for her situation, and indicated\nthat each of the seven debts had been included in a recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy\ncase. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for\nher current employer since 1989 as the office administrator/manger and as the facility\nsecurity manager (FSO) (Exhibit D). She has held a top-secret security clearance for\nmany years and received training to perform the FSO duties. Since about November\n2006, she has worked as the contracts assistant supporting a team of contracting\n\n3\nofficers and specialists. As such, she no longer performs FSO duties. Her current\nannual gross salary is about $58,000 (Exhibit P). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, which she does not dispute, stem from a difficult\nperiod of her nearly 20-year marriage, which ended in divorce in February 2008 (Exhibit\nQ). Before the difficulties, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was strong enough that in\napproximately 2004 she and her husband gave $40,000 to their daughter for a down\npayment on a house (Tr. 69\u201370). \nThings changed in about December 2005, when her husband suffered a work-\nrelated injury from a fall. Essentially self-employed and without disability insurance, he\nwas unable to return to work on a full-time basis, although he worked sporadically. He\nhad health insurance through Applicant\u2019s employment and he was a heavy user of\nmedical services (Exhibit F\u2013reflecting 164 claims against Applicant\u2019s health insurance\nfrom February 2006 to October 2007). His unemployment resulted in the family going\nfrom two incomes to one. Applicant attempted to manage the financial situation on her\nincome and by using  credit cards. \nNot working, Applicant\u2019s husband increased his consumption of alcohol and\nbecame a heavy drinker. His drinking grew worse to the point that Applicant sought\ntreatment for him in May 2007, but he was not amenable to treatment. Applicant\nseparated from her husband a few months later in July 2007.\nFacing a financial crisis, Applicant sought legal counsel who advised her to seek\nrelief via a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which provides individual debtors, with a\nregular income, an opportunity for rehabilitation with a court-approved plan for payment\nto creditors. This is sometimes called a wage-earner\u2019s plan. Applicant initiated the\nChapter 13 case in October 2007. In doing so, she completed credit counseling as\nrequired by bankruptcy law (Exhibit E). The bankruptcy court approved her plan in\nDecember 2007 (Exhibits A and M). The court-approved plan requires Applicant to pay\n$450 monthly for 60 months to the bankruptcy trustee who will then pay creditors. \nSix of the seven debts in the SOR are in Schedule F (unsecured debt) of\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy case (Exhibits B and O). The seventh debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f\nis in Schedule D because the creditor held a secured claim against a car. This matter\nwas resolved when the creditor withdrew its objection to confirmation of the plan,\nApplicant surrendered the car to the creditor, and the creditor was allowed to file an\namended proof of claim for the deficiency balance (Exhibits J, K, and L). Applicant is\nmaking the required monthly payment to the bankruptcy trustee by using payroll\ndeduction with $225 payments twice a month (Exhibit P). \nApplicant\u2019s two adult children, a 28-year-old daughter and a 26-year-old son,\ntestified at the hearing. Both children confirmed their stepfather\u2019s decline after his fall,\nhis apparent alcoholism, and his unwillingness to obtain treatment. Likewise, both\nconfirmed how difficult and trying the last few years were for their mother. Indeed, in\nJuly 2007, when his mother separated from his stepfather, the son felt compelled to\n\n Department of Navy v.

He is now living with her and\nworking in the local area. \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor appeared at the hearing and his testimony is\nnoteworthy (Tr. 36\u201353). The supervisor served in the Marine Corps during 1965\u20131995\nand retired as a colonel. He served in the infantry for about 12 years before working in\nlogistics, with specialities in ordnance, munitions, and classified programs. Also, he\ncommanded units at the company and battalion levels. During Operations Desert Shield\nand Storm in 1990\u20131991, he served as the ordnance officer for the Marine Corps. He\nbelieves he has held a top-secret security clearance since about 1973. He has worked\nfor defense contractors since 1995. He supervised Applicant as officer manager and\nFSO from about January 2002 to January 2006. In his opinion, Applicant was the best\nsecurity manager he has worked with; she did a superb job in her FSO duties, as\nevidenced by security inspections that always went well. He strongly believes Applicant\nis a dedicated and conscientious employee and a person of integrity. He has no doubts\nor concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions of Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n Revised Guidelines at p. 14. \n18\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.\nGuideline F contains six conditions that could mitigate the security concerns.18\nThe record evidence is sufficient to conclude that four of the six mitigating conditions\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor as follows:\n\u2022\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u2022\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n\u2022\nThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and \n\u2022\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts. \nEach MC is discussed below. \nThe first MC applies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems began shortly after\nher husband\u2019s fall in late 2005 and the corresponding loss of his income. Her situation\nbecame more difficult and complicated due to her husband\u2019s heavy drinking and\nunwillingness to obtain treatment. These  circumstances are unlikely to recur because\nApplicant separated from her husband in July 2007 and obtained a divorce in February\n2008. She is now financially responsible for her own circumstances and she earns\nsufficient income to do so. Because she resolved the source of her financial problems,\nand she has a plan to resolve her indebtedness via the Chapter 13 plan, her financial\nproblems do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe second MC applies because Applicant incurred the indebtedness under\ncircumstances largely beyond her control. Her financial house was in good order until\n2006\u20132007 when her husband lost his income and went into a downward spiral due to\n\n7\nhis health problems accompanied by heavy drinking. She tried to keep things afloat by\nusing available credit until it was clear to her that she needed to dissolve the marriage.\nShe separated from her husband, obtained the Chapter 13 plan, and her divorce\nrecently became final. Given the trying and difficult circumstances of this particular\ncase, she has acted responsibly within the meaning of the guideline. \nThe third MC applies because there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved or are under control, and Applicant had credit counseling\nas part of the bankruptcy case. The seven delinquent debts in the SOR are being\nresolved via the Chapter 13 plan, she is not incurring new delinquent debt, and she is\notherwise living within her means.  \nThe fourth MC is pertinent here, as it requires a person to initiate a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. She is addressing her\nindebtedness through the court-approved plan and she has made the required $450\nmonthly payments to date. With a 60-month plan, Applicant will pay $27,000 toward\nresolving her indebtedness. She is earning a good salary and has sufficient income to\npay her normal living expenses and her bankruptcy payments. Given the totality of facts\nand circumstances, her efforts are sufficient to constitute a good-faith effort within the\nmeaning of the guideline.\nThis case has also been considered under the whole-person concept. Applicant\nis 50 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about her finances.\nShe has demonstrated maturity and good judgment by taking concrete actions to\naddress the financial problems caused by circumstances largely beyond her control.\nIndeed, this is a case of bad things happening to an otherwise responsible person who\nhas held a security clearance, without an adverse incident, for many years. In addition,\nshe benefits from the unwavering endorsement of her former supervisor, a highly-\nexperienced professional who has worked about 42 years in Defense Department\nrelated affairs. He has no doubts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s security suitability, and\nhis opinion has received due consideration.  \nTo conclude, based on the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\nunfavorable, Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant met her ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\n \nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He submitted a second response to the SOR,\ndated October 15, 2007, that was accepted by DOHA as a complete response. The two\nresponses are being considered herein as a consolidated response without objection by\nDepartment Counsel or Applicant. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations contained in\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 29, 2008\n\n2\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b. 1.d and 2.a, denied the allegations contained in subparagraphs\n1.c, 3.a, 3.b and 3.c, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 20, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on November 29, 2007, scheduling the hearing for December 17, 2007. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. The government called one witness and submitted\nthree documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3, and\nadmitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted two\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-2, and admitted into\nthe record without objection. The transcript was received on January 4, 2008.     \nProcedural Matters\nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by striking the\ndate \u201cMarch 1, 2007\" in SOR subparagraphs 3.a, 3.b and 3.c and substituting therefore the\ndate \u201cJanuary 25, 2007.\u201d After hearing arguments and testimony on the motion (Tr. pp. 61-\n80) and without objection from Applicant, I granted the motion and made the requested\namendment on the face of the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old single man who has been employed as a scheduling\nspecialist by a defense contractor since December 2006. From August 2005 until\nDecember 2006, he worked as a program scheduler consulting with the defense\ncontractor.

He attended college from 1999\nuntil May 2003, when he was awarded a degree in environmental science. Applicant\nworked as a laborer while in college.      \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana on a fairly regular basis during his first two\nyears in college. In March 2001, while on spring break during his second year of college,\nApplicant used marijuana in a foreign country where the use of marijuana is legal.\nApplicant moved out of the dormitory where he lived during the first two years of college\nshortly after the trip to that foreign country and stopped using marijuana completely\nthereafter. He estimates he used the marijuana on about a weekly basis during the two\nyears he resided in the dormitory and acknowledged he occasionally shared the marijuana\nhe purchased with friends. \nApplicant was charged with tampering with a fire call box and possession of\nmarijuana by campus police after they searched the room he shared with another student.\nThe room search resulted from the improper activation of a fire alarm which was attributed\nto Applicant and his roommate. Applicant appeared in a civilian court, was ordered to\ncomplete 20 hours community service by a judge, and the charges were thereafter\ndismissed. \n\n3\nApplicant executed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(E-Quip) on or about January 25, 2007. In response to applicable questions, he failed to\ndisclose he had used marijuana and had been arrested within the preceding 7 years as\nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation in his SOR response and in his testimony for not disclosing\nthe marijuana use was because he believed more than seven years had passed since his\nlast use. His explanation for not disclosing the arrest in the SOR response and in his\ntestimony was because he did not believe the offenses had occurred within the preceding\n7 years or that he had been charged with an offense since the marijuana was not his and\nthe charges were dismissed. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) on May 4, 2007. At that time, when asked why he did not list the\narrest in the E-Quip, Applicant stated:\n. . . he felt that it was trivial and that it was - - because he was cited by\ncampus police and not the regular police department he didn\u2019t feel that it\nactually counted and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize his job or plans over\nsomething trivial. (Tr. pg. 36)\nHe went on further to tell the investigator:\n. . . he did not list these charges on his SF-86 because he did not want to run\nthe risk of being declined for a job or clearance based on charges that he did\nnot consider to be \u201creal\u201d charges, and therefore did not list them. (GE 3)\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H (drug involvement),\nJ (criminal conduct) and E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations. Likewise, criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness; and, by its very nature, calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \nApplicant purchased, used and shared marijuana with friends on a regular basis\nbetween 1999 and 2001. He was charged with possession of marijuana and tampering with\na fire call box in March 2001, and was required to perform community service after which\n\n5\nthe charges were dismissed. Under guideline H, disqualifying conditions (DC) 25(a): any\ndrug abuse; and 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution\napply. Under guideline J, DC 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.     \nApplicant\u2019s only use, purchase or sharing of marijuana occurred when he was a\nyoung college student. His testimony strongly suggests he made a conscious choice to\nstop using the substance when he moved out of his college dormitory in the spring of 2001,\nand he has abided by that decision ever since. The fire alarm offense occurred what is now\nalmost 7 years ago and appears to be an isolated incident that is unlikely to recur. Under\nGuideline H, mitigating conditions (MC) 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago . . . or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 26(b): a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs\nwere used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence apply. Under Guideline J, MC 32(a):\nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 32(d): there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence\nof criminal activity, remorse of restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement apply.\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse and relatively minor criminal conduct both occurred when\nhe was a young college student away from home for the first time. Shortly after being\narrested and required to perform community service he apparently matured and realized\nit was time to avoid those types of misconduct which could jeopardize his future. The\nmitigating conditions that exist under Guideline H and Guideline J are sufficient to\novercome the security concerns that existed under those guidelines and they are found for\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for not listing his marijuana use and arrest in the 2007 E-\nquip he submitted are not credible. He began college in 1999, used marijuana regularly\nuntil sometime in the spring of 2001, and was charged with the possession of marijuana\nand the fire alarm offense in March 2001. Seven years prior to the submission of the E-\nquip, Applicant was a freshman just starting his second college semester. It is\nunreasonable for him to assert he believed his two years of regular and somewhat\n\n6\nextensive marijuana abuse, his arrest, and his decision to move out of the dormitory and\nstop using marijuana all occurred during his first semester of college. \nTotally believable is the testimony and report of the OPM investigator that Applicant\ntold her he was concerned about the impact truthful reporting of his past conduct might\nhave on his ability to obtain a security clearance and maintain his employment. DC 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nI have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and find none apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern\ncaused by his personal conduct. He has failed to overcome the case against him in this\nregard or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline E is decided against\nApplicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nOn November 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 7, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 21, 2008, Applicant \nchanged his request to a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was \nassigned to me on May 6, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 20, 2008, \nJune 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 5, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. Applicant objected on the basis of hearsay. The \nobjection was overruled and the request was approved. The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as HE I \nthrough XII. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one witness, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through D, which were received without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel \nsubmitted a hearing brief and a copy of a DOHA Administrative Judge\u2019s decision for \nargument purposes. They were marked HE XIII and XIV.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in Iran. \nApplicant came to the United States in the late 1970s to attend college. He graduated \nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree and also obtained a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. from \nAmerican universities. He remained in the United States and became a U.S. citizen in \n2000. Applicant\u2019s wife was also born in Iran. She was introduced to Applicant through a \nrelative. They met in Iran in 2001, and married in Iran in 2002. She became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2006. As discussed below, U.S. citizens who were born in Iran are considered \nIranian citizens by Iranian authorities. She maintained an Iranian passport in order to \nvisit her relatives in Iran. They have a three-year-old child.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, five siblings, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law are all \ncitizens and residents of Iran. His sixth sibling lives in the U.S. as a permanent resident. \nHis father owns a farm and his mother does not work outside the home. His two \nbrothers are self-employed or own their own business in industries unrelated to the \nIranian government. They have both applied to become U.S. permanent residents. Their \napplications are pending. His three sisters work in education and medicine. Two of his \nsisters have applied to immigrate to a western hemisphere country. He speaks to his \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nparents on the telephone about once or twice a month. His father-in-law is self-\nemployed in a private business and his mother-in-law is not employed outside the \nhome. His parents-in-law have U.S. permanent residence status and divide their time \nbetween the U.S. and Iran. His brother-in-law works in the family business.2 \n \n \nApplicant visited Iran on five occasions between about 2000 and 2005. He \ntraveled to Iran using an Iranian passport. He renewed his Iranian passport after the last \ntrip. When he realized that possession of a foreign passport posed a security concern, \nhe \u201csurrendered\u201d it to his facility security officer (FSO). The FSO certified she accepted \nApplicant\u2019s passport and that her company would notify DOHA \u201cimmediately if the \nforeign passport is ever returned to [Applicant].\u201d Applicant has not formally renounced \nhis Iranian citizenship, as that would be ill-advised. He has verbally renounced his dual \ncitizenship. He does not intend to return to Iran. He would visit his family in a third \ncountry if necessary.3 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He is described as responsible, \nhonest, diligent, and trustworthy, with good character. He is considered a good citizen, \nwho is very loyal to the United States.4 \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 74-84, 87-92; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n3 Tr. at 66-71, 77, 93-104; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n4 Tr. at 50-51; AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n5 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents, five siblings, and in-laws are citizens and residents of Iran, a \ncountry that is clearly hostile to the United States.5 His wife, although a U.S. citizen, is \nalso considered an Iranian citizen. Iran is considered the world\u2019s leading state sponsor \nof terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights \nabuses against its people. His family members\u2019 presence in Iran creates a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, both \nthrough him and through his wife. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), (b), and (d) have been raised by the evidence. No security concerns are raised by \nApplicant\u2019s brother who is a U.S. permanent resident. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for about 30 years and has been a U.S. citizen \nsince 2000. His wife is an American citizen and his child was born in the United States. \nHowever, because of his close family ties to Iran and the nature of the government of \nIran, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully applicable.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) applied at one point. The renewal of his Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen could \nraise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his Iranian \ncitizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nIran continued to consider Applicant an Iranian citizen after he was naturalized as \na U.S. citizen. As such, he was required to use an Iranian passport to enter Iran. When \nhe became aware that the passport was a security concern, he surrendered it to his \ncompany\u2019s security officer. To the extent that Iran considers him an Iranian citizen, he is \nvery willing to renounce that citizenship. AG \u00b6 11(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) \nand (e) are applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. He came \nto the U.S. about 30 years ago to attend college. He obtained several advanced \ndegrees and remained, becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000. He is very highly regarded \npersonally and professionally.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \n\n \n9 \n \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is the \nworld\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a dismal human rights record. \nApplicant and his wife both have a significant amount of close family members who are \ncitizens and residents of Iran. Applicant is obviously an intelligent, honest, trustworthy, \nand loyal U.S. citizen. He just was unable to mitigate the considerable security concerns \nraised by his family in Iran. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant\nunder Guidelines H, E and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 1, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in an undated written response, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request in October 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on October 30, 2007. This case was initially assigned\nto another judge, but was reassigned to me on December 10, 2007. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 22, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Application, dated April 11, 2006) at 6, 12-13, 38.\n1\n2\nFebruary 13, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\n(AE) A through D, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non February 22, 2008. I held the record open until February 25, 2008, for the\nsubmission of additional matters.  On February 18, 2008, Applicant submitted AE E,\nwhich was admitted without objection. The record closed on February 25, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he was not sure when he received the hearing\nnotice. (Tr. at 8.) File correspondence indicates he received the hearing notice on\nJanuary 31, 2008, less than 15 days before the hearing. I advised Applicant of his right\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive notice of the hearing 15 days before the\nscheduled date. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. at 8-9) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDuring the hearing and in light of Applicant\u2019s testimony, Department Counsel\nmoved to amend sentence two of allegation 2.a of the SOR to correctly reflect\nApplicant\u2019s sentence by the court for his driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)\nconviction. Applicant agreed to the amendment, which I granted. (Tr. at 36-37)\nAt the close of the testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by\nadding either a new allegation under Guideline E regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption or a Guideline G allegation regarding alcohol consumption. Applicant\nopposed the motion. After discussion, the government withdrew its request to add a\nGuideline G allegation because of due process issues. I denied the government\u2019s\nrequest to amend Guideline E, indicating that Applicant\u2019s drinking patterns would be\nconsidered in the whole person analysis of my decision. (Tr. at 63-69)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations\nin the SOR, with explanations, except the factual allegation in \u00b6 3.a of the SOR.\nApplicant is 46 years old. He works as an aircraft helper for a Department of\nDefense contractor, a position he has held since January 2006.

The court awarded him physical custody\nof his young sons, whom he raised. His oldest son is 22 and lives independently. His\nyounger son is 20 and lives with him. His younger son works and provides financial\nsupport to the household. A friend of his younger son also lives in the household and\nprovides financial support.2\nIn 1989, during his divorce process, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter\n7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He did so because of credit card debt. The court discharged\nhis debts.3\nFollowing his divorce, he started drinking more than he thought he should drink\nwithout elaborating on the quantity or frequency of his drinking at this time. He decided\nhe needed to address his drinking and began attending alcoholics anonymous (AA). He\nattended AA for a year. Later in the 1990s, he again attended AA for several years.\nWhen participating in AA, he did not drink, as it is a requirement of AA. He attended AA\nagain in 2004 and 2005. He likes the program. He denies that he is an alcoholic. He has\nnever been in an alcohol treatment program and has never been diagnosed with alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence. He continues to drink at home on the weekends and\noccasionally to intoxication. He usually drinks 4 to 6 beers. He does not drink any hard\nliquor.4\nIn 1999 at age 37, Applicant began smoking marijuana to relax. He smoked\nmarijuana a couple of times a week, sometimes at home with friends and associates.\nHe never smoked marijuana in the presence of his sons. He purchased marijuana about\ntwice a month. He quit smoking marijuana in April 2003. He decided to stop smoking\nmarijuana after losing three jobs because of his marijuana use and because he was\ngoing nowhere. Following this decision, he started attending narcotics anonymous (NA).\nHe participated in this program for a year. He has not smoked marijuana since April\n2003. He did not drink during this time.5\nIn 1999, Applicant worked at a refinery, a job he had held since 1986. While\nworking with asphalt, he sustained an injury when a hose he was using to pump asphalt\ninto a truck split in his hand and sprayed asphalt on his face. When he sought medical\ntreatment for this injury, the physician performed a drug screen, in accordance with\ncompany policy. The test revealed his marijuana use. The refinery fired him.6\n\nId. at 28-31.\n7\nId. at 31.\n8\nThe court ordered program is not an alcohol treatment program, but an alcohol education program. GE 2,\n9\nsupra note 4, at 23.\nId. at 34-36, 55, 57; GE 3 (Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal records) at 2.\n10\nTr. at 38, 45.\n11\n4\nFrom 1999 until September 2001, he worked in a manufacturing plant. He\nsustained another on-the-job injury when he fell off of scaffolding and injured his arm.\nThe company sent him to a physician, who conducted a urinalysis test. This test\nindicated his marijuana use and the company fired him. He then worked for a furniture\ncompany in the warehouse and later as a driver. While delivering furniture in a home, he\nran into a glass door, cutting himself. Again, his employer\u2019s physician conducted routine\ntests, which showed his marijuana use. The company fired him from this job in March\n2003. At this point, he decided to change his life. These companies did not routinely test\nfor drugs.7\nApplicant enrolled in a truck driving school and obtained his trucker\u2019s license. He\ndrove a truck over the road for a year. He voluntarily left this job as he did not like being\naway from home 26 days out of 30 days each month.8\nIn November 2004, he and his cousin drove to a country western bar. During the\ncourse of the evening, they danced and drank. He acknowledges he drank to excess\nthat evening. He has little memory of what happened after he left the bar. From reading\nthe police report, he understands that when he was driving home, he lost control of his\ncar and hit a parked car, got out of his car, walked a very short distance, and collapsed\non the side of the road. He woke up in jail. The police charged him with DUI, his first, hit\nand run and property damage. He pled guilty to DUI. The court sentenced him to 10\ndays in jail and alcohol school,  directed he participate in a victim impact panel, and\n9\nfined him $1,690. He served his jail time over five weekends on work release. As a first\noffender, he attended the required alcohol program for the mandatory three months. He\nalso complied with the other requirements of his sentence. Since this incident, he has\nnot driven after drinking. He acknowledged drinking and driving on other occasions\nbefore the accident. He uses alcohol more responsibly now.10\nIn 2005, Applicant decided to relocate his home from State A to State B, many\nmiles away, to be nearer his brother. He worked for a temporary agency until he started\nhis present position. After work and on weekends, he spends time with his brother,\nworking on cars and helping his brother remodel his house, or at home.11\nAlthough he obtained jobs after being fired from his job at the refinery, these jobs\npaid significantly lower wages than his job at the refinery. Over time, he got behind in\nhis bills. In 2006, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. He\n\nId. at 39-40, GE 2, supra, at 7-9, 10-21; AE D (copies of bankruptcy payments).\n12\nAE E (Earnings statements since December 7, 2007).\n13\nAE A (Letter, dated January 31, 2008); AE B (Undated letter); AE C (Undated letter).\n14\n5\ndeveloped a monthly payment plan to pay his $10,000 of debt with the bankruptcy\ntrustee. He began making monthly payments of $300 in November 2006. He has made\neach monthly payment since this date. His payments will end in November 2009.12\nApplicant currently earns approximately $3,130 a month in gross pay and $2,254\na month in net pay. His monthly expenses total approximately $1,600, including his\npayment to the bankruptcy trustee. His son and son\u2019s friend contribute to the rent and\nutilities in the house.13\nApplicant no longer associates with the friends he had when he lived in State A.\nHis new friends are not interested in drugs or drinking nights. He lives quietly. His\nsupervisor and co-worker describe him as an ethical man, dependable, hardworking, a\nhigh contributor to the company\u2019s mission, and a valuable asset. His brother states that\nhe has turned his life around.14\nApplicant testified credibly at the hearing to the above facts. He revealed all his\nnegative information in his SF-86. He has made no attempt to hide the negative factors\nin his life.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand\nhallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n\n7\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nIn addition, under Guideline H, AG \u00b6 25 the following disqualifying conditions\nmay raise a security concern in this case:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nApplicant started smoking marijuana, an illegal substance, on a regular basis in\n1999. He purchased some of the marijuana he smoked. Following routine medical\ntesting, he lost three jobs because of his marijuana use. The above disqualifying\nconditions have been raised.\nUnder AG \u00b6 26, the following conditions may mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\nAfter he lost his third job in March 2003 because of his marijuana use, he took a\nhard look at his life and his conduct. He decided to cease smoking marijuana in April\n2003. He sought the assistance of NA to keep this decision. Although he stopped\nattending NA after one year, he continues to abide by his decision five years ago not to\nsmoke marijuana. Three years ago, he moved to a new location many miles from his\nformer friends. His new friends and his brother are not drug users. Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his drug use because it has been nearly five\nyears since he last smoked marijuana, and as a result of moving, he no longer has\ncontact with his former drug-using associates and now lives in an environment which he\nkeeps drug free. I conclude AG \u00b6 26 (a) applies. AG \u00b6 26 (b) partially applies as all\nconditions are met except for AG \u00b6 26 (b)(4).\n\nArguably, AG \u00b6 16 (d)(3) does not apply to the DUI offense in SOR \u00b6 2.a because the alcohol related driving\n15\noffense could have been alleged under Guideline G or Guideline J.\n8\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern under Guideline E, Personal Conduct as: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nIn addition, under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 16 the following disqualifying conditions\nmay raise a security concern in this case:\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . .(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations; . . .\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing.\nThe government alleges that a security concern has arisen because of\nApplicant\u2019s DUI charges in 2004, his first offense.  In November 2004, Applicant\n15\ndecided to drive home after an evening of heavy drinking with his cousin, a decision\nwhich reflects poor judgment and violates state driving laws. His decision resulted in an\naccident, but no injuries. He also admitted that he drove after drinking on other\noccasions prior to November 2004. This conduct constitutes a pattern of rule violations\nand credible adverse information which may result in a negative whole-person\nassessment. Thus, this disqualifying condition is applies.\nThe government also alleges that Applicant\u2019s past marijuana use constitutes a\npattern of rule violations under AG \u00b6 16 (d)(3). This disqualifying condition concerns\ncredible adverse information not explicitly covered under any other guideline. The\ngovernment specifically and properly raised Applicant\u2019s past marijuana use under\nGuideline H. Thus, to raise it again under Guideline E gives the appearance that should\n\n9\nthe Applicant establish the existence of mitigating conditions under Guideline H, the\ngovernment wants a second chance to deny an Applicant\u2019s security clearance for the\nsame conduct.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following\nmitigating conditions may apply:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\n Applicant\u2019s DUI is not a minor offense, particularly since he hit a parked car after\nlosing consciousness either because he fell asleep, passed out or blacked out while at\nthe wheel of his car. Thus, the first clause of AG \u00b6 17 (c) is not raised. Applicant readily\nadmitted to his DUI in his SF-86 and at his criminal trial, when he pled guilty to DUI.\nSubsequent to his arrest, he started attending AA meetings, which are not formal\ncounseling programs, but are a means to attain support for behavior changes and\nmodify alcohol usage. He attended AA for about one year. Since his accident, he\nobtained steady work and a good paying job in a new town. He has taken control of his\nfinances and abstained from driving a car after drinking. He has new friends who are not\ninterested in drinking at bars then driving. He limits his drinking to the weekends, and\nhis alcoholic consumption to four to six beers over a weekend.  His actions reflect the\npositive steps he has taken to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation or duress. His current alcohol consumption does not cast doubt on his\nreliability and trustworthiness now and in the future. Likewise, since he no longer uses\nmarijuana, any security concerns about his past drug use have been mitiagted by the\npassage of time. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c), 17 (d) and 17 (e) listed above\napply.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n10\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. During his marriage, Applicant accumulated unpaid credit card debt,\nwhich caused him to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He started accumulating new unpaid\ndebt after he lost his jobs in 1999, 2001, and 2003. The evidence of delinquent debt is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination of Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\n1989 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge occurred more than 18 years ago. By itself, this\nevent raises little concern about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability or trustworthiness\ntoday. Because the bankruptcy cannot be considered in isolation, and noting that since\nhis 1989 bankruptcy does not raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, this mitigating condition has some applicability, but\ndoes not fully apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose from his loss of a well-paying job at the refinery, which resulted in his\nobtaining lower paying positions. However, as he lost this job and two other jobs\nbecause of his marijuana use, these job losses are not a result of factors beyond his\ncontrol, but because of his own conduct. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nMitigating conditions AG & 20(c) Athe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control@, and AG & 20(d) Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debt\u201d apply. Although Applicant did not\nseek financial counseling, his financial problems are being resolved and his finances are\nunder control. About two years ago, Applicant recognized that he needed to gain control\nover his finances, particularly his unpaid debt. He decided to file for bankruptcy\nprotection under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. With the assistance of the\nbankruptcy trustee, he developed a workable repayment plan for his debts. He began\npaying $300 a month in November 2006. He has made his required monthly payments\nconsistently for the last 16 months. He pays his other monthly expenses and lives within\n\n11\nhis financial means. He is now financially sound. I conclude this potentially mitigating\ncondition applies. The remaining mitigating conditions are not relevant in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant decided to use marijuana\nto release his stress.  This decision caused him more stress, because he lost three jobs\nbecause of his marijuana use. Following the loss of his third job, he took a hard look at\nhis marijuana use and its impact on his life. He realized that his marijuana use was not\nhelping him, but taking his life in a direction he did not want to go. He made a decision\nto give up smoking marijuana five years ago. He continues to abide by this decision. His\n1989 bankruptcy is unrelated to his more recent financial problems. For at least 10\nyears, he managed his finances. After losing his job at the refinery, he obtained other\nwork at a significantly lower salary. His financial problems began to develop and\ncontinued because of job loss and his marijuana use. Once he found a better paying\njob, he took control of his finances by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. He is\npaying his old debts and his current bills. \nApplicant first sought AA assistance shortly after his divorce in 1990, a traumatic\nevent, because he recognized he was drinking too much. Through his one-year\nparticipation in AA, he received emotional support in managing his life and his use of\nalcohol. As the stresses of working and raising children as a single parent increased, he\nagain sought the emotional assistance AA offered to help him with his use of alcohol\nand his personal issues. By 1999, he had stopped drinking to relieve stress. He,\nhowever, started smoking marijuana as a stress reliever. He eventually realized that this\ndecision was a poor decision and stopped his marijuana use. \nIn 2003, Applicant understood he needed to make changes in his life style as he\nwas \u201cgoing no where\u201d. He stopped his drug use totally, initially with the help of NA and\nlater on his own. He, however, continued to drink alcohol at times. His DUI charges in\n2004, his first and only alcohol-related incident, acted as a wake up call about his\n\nIn a number of recent cases, the Appeal Board has reversed decisions of administrative judges granting\n16\nsecurity clearances to Applicant\u2019s who continue to use alcohol. In ISCR Case No. 06-17541 (App. Bd. Jan.\n14, 2008) the Applicant had three alcohol related incidents in a relatively short period of time and failed to keep\nhis promise to abstain from drinking. In ISCR Case No. 06-08708 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007), Applicant had\nthree alcohol-related incidents, had relapsed after completing an alcohol treatment program, and had been\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. In ISCR Case No.  06-12901 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007),  the Applicant had\nseveral significant alcohol related incidents, had been diagnosed as an alcohol abuser, had relapsed after his\ntreatment and diagnosis, had his driver\u2019s license suspended for driving after consuming alcohol, and had\nattended at least two substance abuse treatment programs. In ISCR Case No. 04-10799 (App. Bd. Nov. 9,\n2007), the Appeal Board found the evidence insufficient to establish a \u201ctangible track record\u201d of responsible\nuse of alcohol following three DUI convictions and participation in two alcohol-related treatment programs.\nThese cases are distinguishable from this case in that each case involves several alcohol-related incidents,\nnot one, diagnoses of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependent, and relapse after treatment.  \n12\ndrinking. Shortly after this incident, he moved to a new location and changed his\nbehavior. He limits his drinking to weekends and he restricts the amount of alcohol he\nconsumes. He took control of his finances and complies with his bankruptcy repayment\nplan. He no longer associates with drug users.\nIn his divorce, the court found him a fit parent and awarded him custody of his\ntwo sons. He raised his sons alone. Both are grown and working. There is no evidence\nthat either son has problems functioning in society. These factors are a positive\nreflection of how he raised his sons. His supervisor praises him as an employee, finding\nhim reliable, energetic and hardworking. While he has participated in AA off and on over\nthe years, no medical professional has ever diagnosed him as alcohol dependent or as\nan alcohol abuser. Although he continues to drink alcohol, he does so in a responsible\nmanner by limiting both the quantity of his consumption and the times he drinks. His\ndecision to not drink and drive reflects a responsible attitude. His current alcohol use is\nnot an automatic prohibition against him holding a security clearance. Because no\nprofessional has ever diagnosed him as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser, and\nsince I am not a licensed medical professional, I cannot make a finding that he is an\nalcoholic based on his voluntary participation in AA. I, however, find that his attendance\nat AA is evidence that he felt he needed help, at times, with his use of alcohol. \nFor many years, Applicant appears to have used either alcohol of marijuana as a\nstress reducer. Five years ago, he recognized that his marijuana use was creating more\nproblems and stress, not reducing his stress levels, so he quit. His only DUI triggered\nadditional recognition that he needed to change his alcohol consumption patterns and\nhe did. To assist himself in these decisions, he changed his social environment by\nmoving to another state, developing new friends who are not interested in drugs or\nconstant drinking, and being closer to family who can provide a support system. He\nlikes his job and does very well at work. His only alcohol-related offense occurred more\nthan three years ago. Since this incident, he consumes alcohol in a responsible manner\nby drinking only on the weekends, by limiting the quantity of his use and by not driving if\nhe has been drinking.16\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n13\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations, drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRichard Murray, Esq.\n\nDuring the hearing Department Counsel stated that the Government would not pursue the Guideline E\n1\nallegations.  Accordingly , the Judge\u2019s favorable findings under this guideline are not at issue.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 14, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 14, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application of\nthe Guideline B mitigating conditions.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant was born in India.  He was educated at Indian and U.S.\nuniversities, and he became a U.S. citizen in the mid-1990s.  His wife was born and raised in India.\nAt the close of the record she was a citizen of India and a legal resident of the U.S.  Applicant has\ntwo brothers, one a citizen of India and the other a recently naturalized citizen of Singapore.  The\nremainder of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s immediate families are citizens and residents of India.  \nFrom the early 1980s until the mid-1990s, Applicant traveled to India four times.  Since then,\nhowever, he has traveled there more frequently due to his mother\u2019s health.  For approximately six\nyears he and his family lived in India, caring for his mother.  Additionally, Applicant and his wife\nhave established several companies to take advantage of U.S. and Indian markets.  Applicant\nestablished the U.S. side of the businesses and his wife the Indian side.  From the late 1990s to the\nmid-2000s, Applicant was CEO and director of an Indian company founded by his wife.  \u201cA\nbrochure from Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s company . . . identified Applicant as a \u2018professional in India\u2019\nworking for his wife\u2019s company and listed Applicant\u2019s personal contact information in India,\nincluding a physical address, e-mail address, and telephone number.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He was also\n\u201cchairman and advisor of an Indian institute, a business established by his wife in India . . .\u201d  \nAlthough he is severing all ties with this organization, he acts as chairman in his wife\u2019s absence.  Id.\nat 4.  Additionally, Applicant is owner and CEO of a U.S. company that has registered an Indian\ncompany owned by Applicant\u2019s wife in the U.S.  His wife owns and directs an Indian software\ndeveloping company with a marketing office in the U.S.  Applicant and his wife own apartments in\nIndia.  Additionally, he owns the home of his parents following their deaths.  The total value of\nApplicant\u2019s Indian real estate holdings is $409,000.00.  \nDuring his trips to India, Applicant acted as a spokesperson for a U.S. national association\nof businessmen seeking to extend their outreach to India, though Applicant has taken steps to\ndistance himself from this association.\n\n3\nIndia is a democratic republic and a strategic partner of the U.S.  The U.S. is India\u2019s largest\ntrading and investment partner.  However, India is increasingly cooperating with Iran and is an active\ncollector of U.S. economic, industrial, and proprietary information.\nThe Board concludes that  the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found\nand his ultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the Guideline B mitigating\nconditions and the whole-person factors.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  Applicant points to a recent case in which the Board remanded a decision to the Judge in\norder to resolve apparent discrepancies between certain language in the decision and the ultimate\nadverse holding.  See ISCR Case No 07-04281 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2008).  Applicant argues that\nsimilar language in his decision constitutes error and requests that the Board remand the case to the\nJudge for further proceedings.  However, the decision as a whole, including the Judge\u2019s extensive\nunchallenged findings of fact, support his adverse security clearance determination.  Furthermore,\nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s weighing of certain pieces of evidence, for example\nconcerning the \u201cvalue or routine nature\u201d of Applicant\u2019s Indian business interests.  See Directive \u00b6\nE2.8(f).  However, \u201c[A]n applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\u201d  See  ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd.

The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted \nwithout objections (Tr. 27).2 Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented no \nwitnesses and no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August \n12, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nThe Government elected not to pursue the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a (1)-(5) (Tr. \n14).

After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old entrepreneur. One of his companies won a contract for \nservices with a Government agency and he requires access to classified information to \nmanage his company. He was born, raised, and educated in India. He completed a \n\u201cdiploma degree\u201d in India, which Applicant described as equivalent to a U.S. master\u2019s \ndegree (Tr. 38, 96).

He also has taken professional courses in real estate and \ninformation technology. After receiving his U.S. college degree, he established his own \ncompany and has been successful in his business. \n \nHe came to the United States with little or no assets and has become a \nrespected U.S. citizen. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994 and is proud to be \nan American and of his accomplishments. He surrendered his Indian passport when he \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant testified he is loyal only to the United \nStates and not to any other country or foreign interests (Tr. 22). The Government has \nnot alleged and there is no evidence to show Applicant has been involved in any \ncriminal or civil misconduct. He considers himself to be respected and trusted by friends \nand colleagues.  \n \n2  GE 7 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice purposes only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born and raised in India. She came to the United States in \n1983 under a student visa seeking a graduate degree (Tr. 22, 38). In 1984, she \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering from a U.S. university. Applicant \nmarried his wife in 1985, and they have two children, ages 16 and 15 (Tr. 95, 22, 41). \nBoth children were born in the United States and attend high school in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s wife worked 12 years for an international organization in the United \nStates. She is respected and trusted in that organization. She has been a legal resident \nalien in the United States since 2005. Applicant believes she will qualify for \nnaturalization in 2009, at which time she will become a naturalized U.S. citizen (Tr. 22).  \n \nApplicant has two brothers who were born and raised in India. His brother \u201cH\u201d is \na citizen and resident of India. According to Applicant, H spends 50% of his time in the \nUnited States and 50% in India (Tr. 41). Brother \u201cR\u201d recently became a citizen of \nSingapore, where he resides (Tr. 42). The remainder of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s \nimmediate and extended family members are residents and citizens of India.  \n \nBetween 1983 and 1997, Applicant travelled to India approximately four times to \nvisit his and his wife\u2019s family (Tr. 98). In 1997, he started to travel more frequently to \nIndia because of his mother\u2019s health condition. From January 1998 to April 2004, \nApplicant moved his wife and children back to India to take care of his mother who was \nill (Tr. 45). While in India, he and his family stayed in an apartment owned by his \nparents-in-law (Tr. 46). During this period, Applicant worked with his wife establishing \nher businesses in India (Tr. 46-47).  \n \nApplicant and his wife have established several closely-related companies to \ntake advantage of the United States and the Indian markets. Applicant established the \nU.S. side of the companies. His wife established the Indian side of the companies with \nApplicant\u2019s assistance. In 1996, Applicant and his wife registered a web domain (X.com) \nwith a view of creating an Internet portal in the United States where they could list items \nfor sale in India (Tr. 47).3 In 1999, Applicant established the Internet portal that is \nmaintained and serviced by him in the United States (Tr. 49). At the same time, his wife \nopened a business in India (Y) to list Indian items for sale in Applicant\u2019s web site (Tr. \n48). From 1998 to 2004, Applicant was the chief executive officer and director of his \nwife\u2019s business in India (Y) (Tr. 62). In 2004, his wife became the chairperson of Y.  \n \nApplicant claimed his current role in Y is that of advisor, assisting his wife to build \nbusiness for her company, helping her to find a professional management team, and to \nsell her business (Tr. 62). A brochure from Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s company identified her as \nthe chair of Y (GE 3). That same brochure identified Applicant as a \u201cprofessional in \nIndia\u201d working for his wife\u2019s company and listed Applicant\u2019s personal contact information \nin India, including a physical address, e-mail address, and telephone number. A print \nout of the web site for X.com shows that during an interview of Applicant in May 2008, \nhe was identified as the CEO of X.com (GE 4, Tr. 78-79). At his hearing, Applicant \n \n3  Specific information concerning Applicant\u2019s business enterprises has been withheld to protect \nhis right to privacy. Such information is available in the transcript of the hearing and evidence submitted.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclaimed that information was incorrect (Tr. 79). A \u201c2007 Backgrounder\u201d for X.com \nidentified Applicant as the CEO and spokesperson for X.com, and Applicant\u2019s wife was \nidentified as the Chief Technology Officer for X.com (GE 5, Tr. 79). Applicant and his \nwife advertized their investment properties in India in X.com. \n \nApplicant also was the chairman and advisor of an Indian institute, a business \nestablished by his wife in India with Applicant\u2019s assistance (Tr. 65-67). He testified his \nwife is now the chair of the institute, and that he only works with the institute in an \nadvisory capacity (Tr. 69). He is in the process of severing all ties with the institute, \nhowever, he steps in and acts as the chairman for the institute when his wife is absent \nor he is asked (Tr. 88).  \n \nApplicant is the owner, president, and chief executive officer (CEO) of \u201cA Inc.,\u201d a \nU.S. company he created around 1994 (Tr. 87). He worked for A Inc. from 1994 to 2007 \n(GE 1). A Inc. registered X.com (Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s Indian company) in the United States \n(Tr. 85). His wife owns and is the director of \u201cA Technologies Private Limited\u201d (ATPL) a \nsoftware developing company located in India with a marketing office in the United \nStates (Tr. 69, 84-85). ATPL shares a web site with Applicant\u2019s company A Inc (Tr. 89-\n90). Applicant manages and services the server for both his company and his wife\u2019s \nforeign company (Tr. 89-90). His wife conducts business for ATPL -- communicates with \nher Indian company and with clients of that company -- from Applicant\u2019s home in the \nUnited States. At his hearing, Applicant testified that in November 2007, he resigned his \nposition as president and CEO of A Inc., to distance himself from the day-to-day \noperations of that business company. He claimed he has not represented A Inc., since \nthen (Tr. 6, 21). \n \nMost of Applicant\u2019s trips to India since 2004 were for assisting his wife to \nestablish her businesses. He sought and received Indian government permits and \napprovals for her businesses. Since 2007, Applicant has been helping his wife to merge \nher business with another Indian company. His latest trip was five weeks before his \nhearing (Tr. 90). He will continue his business travels to India until his wife\u2019s company is \nsold or merged with another company (Tr. 90). He believes that after the merge is \ncompleted he will be able to shut down completely one of his wife\u2019s businesses (Tr. 70).  \n \nIn 2001-2002, Applicant and his wife purchased an apartment in India for \ninvestment purposes. His wife owns two apartments in India (Tr. 104-106). Applicant \npersonally manages all their real estate investments in India. As of his hearing day, \nApplicant and his wife still owned their apartments in India (Tr. 54). They rented one \napartment to an Indian software developing company from 2001-2002 to 2007. As of \n2007, the apartment has been vacant (Tr. 55). He estimated the value of the apartment \nto be around $35,000. When Applicant\u2019s parents passed in 2002, he and his brothers \ninherited their parent\u2019s home. Applicant purchased his brother\u2019s interest in the property \nfor $150,000. He estimated the value of this property at $250,000. As of the hearing \ndate, he still owned his parent\u2019s home and it was being rented to a U.S. company doing \nbusiness in India (Tr. 55-58). Applicant\u2019s rental properties in India generate \napproximately $49,500 a year. He estimated the total value of his properties in India at \n\n \n5 \n \n \n$409,000 (Tr. 61). Applicant has a bank account in India worth approximately $43,000 \n(Tr. 62). He keeps the bank account in India for emergencies and to conduct business \nin India. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife moved back to the United States because their \nchildren were growing too quickly and they wanted their children to receive an American \neducation (Tr. 44). After establishing his family back in the United States, Applicant \ntravelled to India twice in 2005 (Tr. 43, 51); once in 2006; four times in 2007 (he stayed \nin India approximately three weeks on each trip); and in 2008 he spent about 30% of \nthis time in India (Tr. 107). His visits to India had several purposes: to assist his wife to \nlocate professional management to run her business (Tr. 45, 51); to find a buyer for his \nwife\u2019s business in India and his Internet company in the United States (Tr. 53); and to \nestablish/continue his business relationships. Applicant and his wife own only one real \nestate property in the United States \u2013 their home. He estimated the value of their home \nto be around $1.5 million (Tr. 112). \n \nDuring his trips to India, Applicant was acted as spokesperson for a U.S. national \nassociation of businessmen seeking to extend their outreach into India and other \ncountries. Because of his heritage, language ability, and professional reputation, \nApplicant was chosen to assist the association in its outreach program promoting U.S. \ninterests in India. At his hearing, Applicant indicated he is beginning to distance himself \nfrom his duties with the association. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is a democratic republic \nwith a cooperative relationship with the United States. The United States recognizes \nIndia as a key to strategic U.S. interests, and has sought to strengthen its relationship \nwith India. The United States and India have been committed to a strategic partnership \nthat has seen expanded cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities, civilian \nspace programs, and technology trade. The United States is India's largest trading \npartner and investment partner. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, differences remain between the two countries, including \nconcerns about India\u2019s nuclear weapons program, abuses of human rights (although, \nthe Indian government is considered to generally respect the human rights of its \ncitizens), and its refusal to sign weapons non-proliferation treaties. Of grave concern is \nIndia\u2019s increasing cooperation and partnership with Iran and its military forces. Despite \nadvancements in the United States-Indian relations, India has been identified by the \nU.S. intelligence community as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. \neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information. The United States has sanctioned \nIndian scientists and chemical companies for transferring to Iran weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD)-related equipment and/or technology. Additionally, there are \nnumerous documented cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s security concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.6 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his in-laws, friends, and colleagues who \nare citizens and residents of India, and with his brother who is an Indian citizen and part \ntime U.S. resident. The closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent \ncontacts with his in-laws and his brother, and the fact he stayed with his in-laws during \nhis trips to India.  \n \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Indian agents may exploit the opportunity to \nobtain information about the United States. His connection to his in-laws, brother, and \nIndian friends and business colleagues also creates a potential conflict of interest \nbecause his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his \ndesire to help them or their businesses by providing sensitive or classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s frequent travel to India also creates a higher risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion by the Indian government, friends, and business \ncolleagues working for or with his wife in her businesses. \n \nApplicant has substantial business, financial, or proprietary interests in India. He \nhas a bank account in India with approximately $43,000. He and his wife own several \ninvestment properties in India that generate approximately $49,500 a year in rent \nrevenue with an approximate value of $409,000. He inherited his parents\u2019 home in India \nwith an approximate value of $300,000. His wife established three companies in India \nwith Applicant\u2019s direct support and assistance. He has held positions as chair, CEO, \nand advisor in his wife\u2019s businesses and still performs does duties when his wife is not \navailable or he is called to substitute for his wife. Her Indian companies are directed \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s business and company in the United States. His wife conducts \nbusiness for her Indian companies from their marital home in the United States. Both \nIndian and American companies share a web site serviced and managed by Applicant. \nApplicant has invested a significant amount of his time and effort traveling to India \nduring the last three years trying to establish, manage, and to sell his wife businesses. \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies. Applicant did not establish that \u201cit is unlikely \n[he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his Indian \nfamily \u2013 in-laws, wife, friends and colleagues] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent \ncontacts and close relationships with his Indian family members could potentially force \nhim to choose between the United States and India. He did not meet his burden of \nshowing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with his Indian family members] \ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nApplicant has traveled to India approximately four times between 1983 and 1997. \nSince 1997 he substantially increased his travels to India. Initially, he traveled to take \ncare of his ill mother. After 2004, he increased his travels to India to promote and \nestablish businesses for his wife in India, to take care of his investment properties, and \nto promote the business interests of a U.S. business organization seeking to expand its \ncharter into India. He has contacts and close relationships with his brother, in-laws, and \nwith his and his wife\u2019s business associates who are citizens and residents of India.  \n \nThe nature of India\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                     \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. I considered that \nthe Indian government is a democratic republic with a cooperative relationship with the \nUnited States. India generally respects the human rights of its citizens. India is not a \nhostile country nor are its interests inimical to the United States. The United States and \nIndia enjoy good relations and the United States is India's largest trading partner.  \n \nNotwithstanding, India\u2019s aggressive collection of proprietary and economic \ninformation, its industrial espionage against the United States and its partnership with \nIran raises the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his contact with \nfamily members in India, friends, colleagues, and his business ties in India do not pose \na security risk and that he will not be placed into a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and his Indian family members.7  \n \nApplicant keeps in contact with friends and colleagues concerning his \ninvestments in India, as well as his wife businesses and financial interests in India. He \nalso assisted a U.S. association to set up a charter association in India; and he worked \nwith Indian authorities to obtain permits and approval for some of his wife\u2019s businesses. \nThus, it is more likely the Indian government is monitoring Applicant\u2019s work, his trips to \nIndia, and his communications with family and friends.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United \nStates for approximately 26 years. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for about 14 \nyears. His children are U.S. citizens born in the United States and are have inculcated \nU.S. values. Applicant has established himself as a successful and respected American \ncitizen.  \n \nApplicant worked for his own company (A Inc.) from 1994 to 2007. A Inc., is \nclosely related to and conduct business with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s three businesses in \nIndia. Aside from his work for A Inc., rents received from his Indian investment \nproperties, and his work for his wife\u2019s Indian companies, Applicant disclosed no other \nwork or source of income. He is in the process of severing all ties with his wife\u2019s Indian \ncompanies to avoid security clearance issues. On balance, I find Applicant has \nsubstantial businesses, financial, or proprietary interest in India. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not \napply. \n \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant strongly averred he and his children are loyal Americans. His wife is in \nthe process of applying for U.S. citizenship. Applicant has lived in the United States for \n26 years and has been a naturalized citizen for 14 years. When he became a U.S. \ncitizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His two sons are also U.S. citizens \nand they are being raised and educated in the United States as Americans.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible. There is \nno reason to believe that he would take any action that could cause potential harm to \nhis sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States. There is no evidence he has ever taken \nany action that could cause potential harm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty \nand integrity. He has the respect and trust of his friends and colleagues in the United \nStates.   \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis: \nhe and his wife were born and educated in India; his wife is an Indian citizen; he and his \nwife have significant business connections, property, and financial interests in India; and \nhe maintains contact with Indian family, friends and colleagues. In sum, he had \nsignificant connections to India before he immigrated to the United States, and through \nhis wife\u2019s family and businesses connections Applicant continues to maintain significant \nfinancial and property interests in India. Applicant has frequent and non-casual contact \nwith his family members living in India. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure \nor attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Indian agents or \nothers hostile to U.S. interests may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in \nIndia or his significant financial/property interests to obtain information about the United \nStates.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns \narising from his foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.s: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government has alleged as one basis for its decision to deny his clearance renewal request that Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances indicate he may give preference to the interests of a foreign government over those of the United States. (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) Specifically, it is alleged that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with the United States and Iran through his possession of an Iranian passport, obtained in August 2007 and valid through August 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he exercised dual citizenship through his use of an Iranian passport in lieu of a U.S. passport he received in June 2001 to travel to Iran between 2001 and 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that Applicant exercised dual citizenship by obtaining an Iranian passport in August 2001 after he had become a U.S. citizen in 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he inherited a house in Iran worth about $100,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he served in the Iranian army between 1972 and 1974 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The government also has alleged that Applicant has interests and contacts in a foreign country that may impair or conflict with his obligation to protect the interests of the United States. (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) Specifically, it is alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of and resides in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that his brother is a citizen of and resides in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, above, he inherited a house in Iran worth about $100,000 (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and that he traveled to Iran ",

After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant three sets of\ninterrogatories to obtain clarification of and/or additional information about adverse\ninformation in his background.  After reviewing his responses to the interrogatories,\n1\nDOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n2\nFebruary 19, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n Department Counsel also asked that I take notice of additional documents included collectively in the record\n4\nas Judicial Exhibit (Jx.) 1.

However, those documents are included in the record\nfor possible appellate review.\n2\nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation. On August 15, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which raised security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline B (foreign influence), Guideline C\n3\n(foreign preference) and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on December 2, 2008, and I convened a hearing on December 17,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx.\n1 - 5).  Applicant testified, but did not submit any documents. DOHA received the\n4\ntranscript of hearing (Tr.) on December 29, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government has alleged as one basis for its decision to deny his clearance\nrenewal request that Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances indicate he may give\npreference to the interests of a foreign government over those of the United States.\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) Specifically, it is alleged that Applicant exercises\ndual citizenship with the United States and Iran through his possession of an Iranian\npassport, obtained in August 2007 and valid through August 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he\nexercised dual citizenship through his use of an Iranian passport in lieu of a U.S.\npassport he received in June 2001 to travel to Iran between 2001 and 2003 (SOR \u00b6\n1.b); that Applicant exercised dual citizenship by obtaining an Iranian passport in August\n2001 after he had become a U.S. citizen in 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he inherited a house\nin Iran worth about $100,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he served in the Iranian army\nbetween 1972 and 1974 (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\nThe government also has alleged that Applicant has interests and contacts in a\nforeign country that may impair or conflict with his obligation to protect the interests of\nthe United States. (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) Specifically, it is alleged that\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of and resides in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that his brother is a\ncitizen of and resides in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, above, he\ninherited a house in Iran worth about $100,000 (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and that he traveled to Iran\nin December 2005, February 2003 and August 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.d).\nFinally, the government alleged it could not grant Applicant\u2019s request because of\nconcerns he had not been candid or truthful about information material to the\ngovernment\u2019s assessment of his suitability for access to classified information.\n\n3\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct) Specifically, it is alleged that, by answering \u201cno\u201d to e-\nQIP question 17.a (Your Foreign Activities - Do you have any foreign property, business\nconnections, or financial interests?\u201d) he deliberately and knowingly failed to disclose his\ninterest in foreign property; that is, the house in Iran he allegedly inherited. (SOR \u00b6 3.a)\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c, 1.e and 3.a. He admitted without explanation the remaining\nallegations. In addition to the facts entered through his admissions, I make the following\nfindings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 59-year-old full professor of electrical and computer engineering at\na private U.S. university, where he has worked since September 1993. Among his\nresponsibilities is the supervision of post-graduate degree candidates doing research\nfunded, inter alia, by civilian and military Department of Defense agencies. He has also\ndone classified research and development work for other government agencies and\nprivate corporations. Applicant is highly regarded in his field of expertise and has been\npublished at least 20 times in the past 16 years. His efforts also have led to significant\nimprovements in his university\u2019s physical assets as well as its academic reputation. (Tr.\n25 - 36)\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran before coming to the United States in 1976\nto pursue multiple post-graduate degrees. He received all of his undergraduate\neducation in Iran, and he served in the Iranian army from 1972 until 1974, fulfilling the\nmandatory military service required of all Iranian males at the time. He also worked as\nan engineer for at least four different state-run agencies in Iran before emigrating to the\nU.S. (Gx. 1; Gx. 4; Answer to SOR) He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991 and\nreceived a U.S. passport in June 2001. (Gx. 1) His mother, brother, and one of his four\nsisters are citizens of and live in Iran. His mother also has her green card after spending\nlong periods of time in the U.S. visiting Applicant. (Tr. 54) She last visited in 2004, but\ndue to her age (82 years old) she can no longer travel overseas. (Tr. 67) \nApplicant\u2019s father, who died in 1973, was a teacher. Applicant\u2019s mother lives on\nthe remainder of his retirement pension. Applicant\u2019s brother used to be a teacher, but\nsince about 1981 has been barred by the government from doing so in Iran\u2019s state-\nsupported schools. He lives with their mother and supports himself through private\ntutoring and by on-line stock trading. Applicant occasionally sends his mother money\ntotaling about $500 each year. (Tr. 49 - 51) He speaks with his mother and brother by\nphone about once each month. (Tr. 57) Applicant also has four sisters. All have Iranian\ncitizenship, but only one still lives in Iran. Two sisters live in Germany and one lives in\nCanada. (Tr. 58) None of Applicant\u2019s relatives are employed by or have any official\nconnection to the Iranian government. \nIn 2001, Applicant was invited to attend an international conference of electrical\nengineers to be held in Tehran, Iran. He had not been back to Iran since before the\n1979 Islamic Revolution there. To travel back to Iran, he obtained an Iranian passport\nas required by Iranian law. Iran considers U.S. citizens who were born in Iran as Iranian\ncitizens and requires the use of an Iranian passport for entering and leaving the country.\n(Tr. 38 - 41; Jx. 1, Attachment II) Since obtaining an Iranian passport, Applicant has\n\n4\nreturned to Iran to visit his family in 2003, 2005, and 2007. (Tr. 64) He renewed his\nIranian passport in August 2007 and does not want to relinquish it, because without it he\ncannot see his mother or his other familymembers. Aside from his mother, Applicant\nhas other family and cultural ties to Iran that constitute other reasons for him to return to\nIran even were his mother not there. (Tr. 41 - 42)\nWhen his father died in 1973, Applicant inherited an interest in his father\u2019s house,\nwhere his brother and mother still live. Applicant estimates the house (more properly\ncharacterized as a condominium) is worth about $100,000. Applicant\u2019s understanding is\nthat, under Islamic law, the house passed to Applicant and his siblings in shares\nweighted in favor of the male children. Of course, Applicant and his siblings never\ncontemplated that his mother would leave the house. To the best of his understanding,\nif his mother pre-deceases Applicant, the house will be disposed of through a process\nsimilar to the United States\u2019 probate system. It is also his understanding that he is not\non any deed for the property and that he is not registered as having any partial interest\nin the property. (Tr. 42 - 44, 60 - 62) Applicant does not receive any income from the\nproperty and there is no indication his interest in the property is contingent on his\nexercise of Iranian citizenship.\nApplicant first applied for a security clearance in 1991. In the security clearance\napplication (SF 86) he submitted at the time, he disclosed he had previously held an\nIranian passport before he was naturalized. He also answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 17.a\n(Do you have any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests?). (Gx.\n5) When he submitted his e-QIP in January 2007 to renew his clearance, he answered\n\u201cno\u201d to the same question, but disclosed again that he held a foreign passport. (Gx 1)\nApplicant explained that when he considered the question on his 2007 e-QIP, he\ndecided to answer \u201cno\u201d because he was not listed on a deed or otherwise registered as\nhaving an interest in his father\u2019s house. (Tr. 45 - 46)\nApplicant owns property in the United States worth about $220,000. He also has\nretirement savings through his current employer and at another university where he\nworked from 1985 through 1993. He insists that if he was approached by Iran or any\nother foreign country that wished to pressure him into compromising U.S. national\ninterests, he would seek out the proper authorities and report the matter. (Tr. 49)\nApplicant had not given any consideration to whether he would be willing to renounce\nhis Iranian citizenship because he does not consider himself to be a dual citizen.\nHowever, he is not willing to relinquish his Iranian passport because without it he cannot\nvisit his relatives there. Further, he has used his Iranian passport only when entering or\nleaving Iran. At all other times, he has used his U.S. passport. (Tr. 41 - 42)\nIn 1979, the Shah of Iran was overthrown in favor of a theocratic government\nbased on Islamic law. Despite occasional gains by more moderate Muslim clerics in the\ngovernment, the Islamic Republic of Iran remains under the control of fundamentalists\ndedicated to a repressive form of government in furtherance of strict adherence to the\nKoran. Iran\u2019s regime has amassed a dismal human rights record. Government entities\nhave been involved in an increased number of abductions, summary executions,\ndisappearance, torture, and other unacceptable practices designed to preserve the\ngovernment\u2019s hold over its citizens. The U.S. State Department has also advised U.S.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n5\ncitizens not to travel to Iran, and has noted instances whereby dual U.S.-Iranian citizens\nhave been singled out for special monitoring and detention. (Jx. 1, Attachments I - IV)\nIran\u2019s global interests are directly antithetical to those of the U.S.. To further their\nregional and global goals, Iran has become an active collector of economic information\nand has an active espionage service which targets U.S. interests and information. Iran\nis also an active sponsor of terrorism, which targets the interests of the U.S. and its\nallies. Finally, the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons\nof mass destruction by Iran is seen by the U.S. as a major threat to regional and\npossibly global stability. (Jx. 1, Attachments V - XI, XIII)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 6 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence), AG \u00b6 9 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nand AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n6\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as addressed in AG\u00b6\n15, is that \n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nApplicant does not contest that he did not disclose his interest in a foreign\nproperty when he completed his most recent security clearance application. However,\nto be disqualifying, his omission must have been made with intent to falsify or mislead.\n(See AG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). Unintentional error or a misunderstanding of the question is not\ndisqualifying. The totality of information bearing on this allegation shows that Applicant\ndid not try to mislead the government here. He had previously disclosed ownership of\nforeign property and was forthcoming about his potential inheritance when he\nresponded to DOHA interrogatories. His thought at the time he submitted his 2007 e-\nQIP was that he did not, in fact, own any foreign property. Further, it is less than clear\nwhat, if any future interest he has in the house where his mother lives and there is no\napparent reason for him to have deliberately withheld that information. Because\nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying his e-QIP answer, the burden was on the\n\n Directive, E3.1.14.\n9\n7\ngovernment to show he acted with the requisite intent.  While the government\n9\npresented sufficient information to show he omitted the information about his father\u2019s\nhouse, available information is not sufficient to show he deliberately lied about it as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. I resolve this security concern in favor of the Applicant.\nForeign Preference. \nThe government denied Applicant\u2019s request for clearance, in part because, after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 1991 and obtaining a U.S. passport in 2001, he exercised\nhis Iranian citizenship by obtaining, using, and continuing to possess a valid Iranian\npassport. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c). Also, the government alleged as a basis for\ndisqualification his alleged inheritance of a house in Iran worth about $100,000 (SOR \u00b6\n1.d) and his two years of service in the Iranian army (SOR \u00b6 1.e). As to SOR \u00b6 1.e, I\nconclude that his service in Iran\u2019s military is not disqualifying because it occurred 17\nyears before he became a U.S. citizen. As to the inheritance of his father\u2019s house, it is\nunclear what his interest in that property might be. Further, the inheritance appears to\nbe a future interest that would pass to Applicant and/or his siblings only as long as\nhe/they survive his mother. Thus, the SOR \u00b6 1.d allegation is not disqualifying. \nHowever, available information is sufficient to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Those established facts, in turn, raise a security concern addressed\nby Guideline C of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Specifically, the government is\nconcerned that, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d(AG \u00b6 9) More specifically, the record requires consideration of Guideline C\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) (possession of a current foreign passport).\nAfter living in the United States for more than 30 years, and more than 10 years after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant obtained and still holds a valid Iranian passport. It\nallows him to travel as an Iranian citizen despite his U.S. citizenship, and his reluctance\nto surrender it reflects Applicant\u2019s divided preference between the U.S. and Iran. \nThe resulting security concerns in this case might be mitigated if the use of his\npassport were sanctioned by the U.S. government or if he had relinquished or\ndestroyed the passport. (See AG \u00b6 11(d): use of a foreign passport is approved by the\ncognizant security authority; and AG \u00b6 11(e): the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) However,\nneither is the case here. In fact, Applicant wishes to retain his Iranian passport so he\ncan continue to travel to Iran and visit relatives. Further, absent any post-naturalization\nexercise of his rights as an Iranian citizen, Applicant\u2019s foreign citizenship, based solely\non his parents\u2019 citizenship (see AG \u00b6 11(a)) would not be disqualifying. But an act in\nfurtherance of a right or privilege of foreign citizenship after naturalization, such as\nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of his Iranian passport since 2001, makes such\nmitigation unavailable. Mitigation might also be available if Applicant expressed a\nwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship. (see AG \u00b6 11(b)) However, Applicant\nhas not made such an expression and affirmatively stated his desire to continue\n\n8\npossession of his passport for ease of travel to Iran. Accordingly, none of the Guideline\nC mitigating conditions apply, and I resolve this guideline against Applicant.\nForeign Influence. The government also stated as reasons for denying\nApplicant\u2019s request for a clearance the fact his mother (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and his brother\n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) are citizens of and reside in Iran. Available information is sufficient to\nsupport these allegations. The established facts, in turn, raise a security concern\naddressed by Guideline B (AG \u00b6 6) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.\nSpecifically, the government\u2019s position is that\n[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has held a security clearance since about 1991. For ten years\nthereafter, the circumstances of his foreign citizenship and foreign ties, which were\nknown to the government at the time his clearance was granted, did not change.\nHowever, beginning in 2001, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d, he began to travel to Iran to see\nhis mother and siblings, in addition to regular telephonic contact. He has stated that he\nhas ties to Iran independent of his mother\u2019s presence there, and all of the information\nhere suggests he is likely to travel there in the future. Contact with his mother and\nbrother, and to a lesser extent, his extended family who are citizens of and reside in\nIran, may be disqualifying \u201cif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d (see \u00b6 AG 7(a)) In\nassessing whether these facts present a heightened risk, I have considered the fact that\nApplicant has regular contact with his mother and brother. I have also considered the\nrepressive nature of the Iranian government towards its own people, particularly where\ndual U.S.-Iranian citizens are concerned. I have also considered Iran\u2019s sponsorship of\ninternational terrorism, aggressive economic espionage and foreign intelligence\nactivities, all of which are conducted in furtherance of its strategic, political, and\neconomic interests hostile and opposed to those of the U.S. and its allies. \nAs to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c regarding the possible inheritance of property in\nIran, for the same reasons stated above regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d, I find for the Applicant.\nAlso, as to the SOR \u00b6 2.d allegation that Applicant traveled to Iran in 2001, 2003 and\n2005, that information is uncontroverted but not, by itself, disqualifying. Rather, it is\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s ties to his family in Iran. Accordingly, I find for the Applicant as\nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. Nonetheless, available information does not support any of the\nmitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 8. Applicant has not shown that his relationship with\nhis family is anything but close or that their presence in Iran, which is governed by a\nrepressive regime with interests hostile to the U.S., may not potentially be used to\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n10\n See footnote 6, supra. \n11\n9\npressure or coerce Applicant to act in a manner contrary to U.S. interests. On balance, I\nconclude Applicant has failed to overcome the adverse information presented by the\ngovernment.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines B, C and E. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a\nmature, responsible, and accomplished professor whose work at a U.S. university\nrequires he be allowed access to classified information. Until he obtained and used a\nforeign passport, he had held a security clearance without incident for nearly 20 years.\nHis work at the university and with various military and civilian organizations has been\nhighly-regarded. Applicant has family and financial contacts over the past 30 years in\nthe United States that suggest he is fully engaged as a U.S. citizen and will remain here\nafter retirement. However, his recent acquisition of a foreign passport and increased\ncontacts with family members in Iran now indicates he has divided preferences between\nIran and the United States. His conduct has been recent, undertaken voluntarily and is\nlikely to continue. As such, it casts doubt on his willingness or ability to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests free of foreign interests or influence. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information shows Applicant has not overcome the doubts,\n10\nraised by the government\u2019s information, about his continued suitability for access to\nclassified information. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c - 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. During the hearing, Applicant amended his answer to \u00b6 1.c. from \u201cdenial\u201d to \u201cadmit.\u201d Tr. 38-39. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 48-year-old senior computer scientist, who has worked for his defense contractor employer since August 2006. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. He graduated from high school in June 1979, and did not pursue higher education after receiving his high school diploma. Tr. 67-68. Applicant was previously married to his first wife from July 1988 to January 1998, and to his second wife from April 1998 to April 2001. Both those marriages ended by divorce. He married his current and third wife in December 2002. Applicant has a 14- year-old daughter and a 15-year-old stepson. GE 1, Tr. 25-26.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to Financial \nConsiderations and Personal Conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 9, \n2006. On September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 27, 2007, which was \nreceived at DOHA on October 2, 2007. He answered the SOR in writing on November \n19, 2007, which he supplemented on November 27, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the responses/requests on November \nMarch 7, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n21, 2007, and November 28, 2007, respectively. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on January 10, 2008, and I received the case assignment on January 17, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 23, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nFebruary 20, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nExcept for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.g., 2.a., and 2.b., Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant amended his answer to \u00b6 1.c. from \u201cdenial\u201d to \u201cadmit.\u201d Tr. \n38-39. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior computer scientist, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since August 2006. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. He graduated from high school in June 1979, and did not pursue \nhigher education after receiving his high school diploma. Tr. 67-68. \n \nApplicant was previously married to his first wife from July 1988 to January 1998, \nand to his second wife from April 1998 to April 2001. Both those marriages ended by \ndivorce. He married his current and third wife in December 2002. Applicant has a 14-\nyear-old daughter and a 15-year-old stepson. GE 1, Tr. 25-26.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his October 2006 and August 2007 credit bureau reports. GE 2, \nGE 4. During a background investigation interview in December 2006, an Office of \nPersonnel (OPM) Investigator confronted Applicant about his delinquencies. He stated \nto the Investigator that he does not intend to pay any of these debts. He explained he \nwas told by his equity loan officer when applying for a loan that if he took any action on \nthe delinquent accounts, the accounts would become current, as opposed to their \ncurrent status as unpaid and dormant accounts. He further explained if the accounts \nbecame current, his credit score would become very low and he would be ineligible for \nloans and other financial considerations. For this reason, he chose to ignore the \naccounts unless the creditors actively pursued him. GE 3 (Results of Interview \nDecember 2006).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started around 2001 to 2002. Although his divorce \nfrom his second wife became final in 2002, he denied having difficulty paying his bills. \nTr. 50-51. When queried by Department Counsel whether he was having difficulty \npaying his bills, Applicant responded, \u201cNo. I was just not diligent in paying my bills.\u201d Tr. \n51. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified seven debts ranging from $109 to $9,252 for a total of \nabout $18,911. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g. His position at his hearing did not change from \nthe time he was interviewed by OPM. He provided various explanations regarding each \ndebt, but provided no documentation corroborating his position or documentation that \nsuggested he attempted or had attempted to resolve any of the debts. In short, all debts \nalleged have not been addressed and are still outstanding. Tr. 70-73. \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. GE 1.  \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28(a) and 28(b) [asking whether in the last seven \nyears he had been 180 days delinquent on any debt, and whether he was currently 90 \ndays delinquent on any debts (respectively)]. He failed to disclose the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. Applicant denied that he deliberately provided false responses \nto these questions. Applicant claims that he \u201cwas unaware of any debts that were 180 \ndays past due,\u201d and \u201c[n]one of the debts in question showed up on my request for a \nFHA mortgage, which would not have been possible had any account been even 30 \ndays past due. The [bank] debts were bought by [bank] from the original creditor, and \nare not current. According to my mortgage consultant, paying those debts would have \nbrought them current, and resulted in my mortgage being denied. By not responding to \n[bank\u2019s] requests, I kept them off of my current report, and out of my current FICO \nscore.\u201d Response to SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at his hearing provided a similar explanation. He adds in \nhis Response to SOR and in his testimony that he brought up the bank mortgage debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.) during his OPM interview. Response to SOR, Tr. 63-67. In assessing \nApplicant\u2019s credibility on this point, I do not find his explanation credible. He was aware \nof past due account concerns when discussing his credit history with his mortgage \nconsultant, aware enough to consciously not pay them to prevent their being \nreactivated. The SOR debts clearly fell within the period covered by questions 28(a) and \n28(b). \n \nApplicant submitted four reference letters that provided favourable comments \nabout his character and supported his being granted a clearance. AE A through D. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to \n2001. Since then, he has accumulated at least seven delinquent/charged off debts \ntotaling approximately $18,911. In December 2006, Applicant was confronted about his \nfinancial problems and indicated he does not intend to pay any of the unpaid accounts. \nHe presented no evidence to show he has taken any action to resolve his debts. As of \nthe hearing date, he still had the same seven outstanding delinquent/charged off debts. \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented no evidence documenting efforts taken \nto contact creditors, or to resolve any of the debts since he acquired them. Nor is there \nany evidence that he has participated in any financial counseling. I specifically \nconsidered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) Guidelines \u00b6 20(b): \nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and conclude it does not apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony fails to establish mitigating factors that may \nbe considered as circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his \ndebts. By his own admission, his divorce did not interrupt his income stream to preclude \nhim from remaining current on his debts. His failure to responsibly deal with his debts \nappears to be a conscious choice. When confronted with the Government\u2019s concerns \nthat his financial past was a security concern, he failed to pursue any corrective action \nthat would have included disputing or otherwise resolving past debts.   \n \nHe presented no evidence to show he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling). \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he \nhas established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control of \nhis financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are likely \nto be a concern in the future. Moreover, his financial problems are recent, not isolated, \nand ongoing.  \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. Guideline & 15. \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to disclose truthful responses to \nquestions 28(a), and 28(b) is not credible. Considering the record as a whole, I am \nconvinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous factors \nweighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of \neducation, his employment history, his demeanor and testimony, the number and value \nof the debts, his long term disregard of the debts, and the lack of credibility of his \nexcuses. He knew the importance of accurate completion of his security clearance \napplication, and nevertheless failed to provide information that was material to making \nan informed security decision. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 16(a): deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire \n. . ., and DC 16(e): personal conduct or concealment of information about one=s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress . . ., apply. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude \nthat none apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and his favorable information is not \nsufficient to apply any of the MCs. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined under the \ndiscussions of Guidelines F, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows \nquestionable judgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole person concept was given due \nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 7, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on November 13, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on December 16, 2007,\nand I received the case assignment on the same day. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a\ndelay until late January 2008, in order for his counsel to be available. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on December 26, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 28, 2008\n\nGE 3 (Applicant\u2019s Security Application Form, dated June 12, 2006).\n1\nAE A (Attachments 1-28).\n2\nTr. 85; 88.\n3\nAE B (Letters of Reference).\n4\n2\nJanuary 31, 2008.

Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 7, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.e, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1979, he started working at a marina. Shortly after that, he joined\nthe U.S. Navy. While in the military, his career progressed from his position as a diesel\nmechanic to Chief Engineer. However, after ten years, he was discharged with an-\nother than honorable (OTH) in May 1989. Applicant used marijuana and tested positive\nfor marijuana in 1983 and in March 1989. The discharge was based on Applicant\u2019s use\nof marijuana and the positive urinalysis tests while in the U.S. Navy.1\nWhile in the Navy, he received numerous awards, recognition and certificates.\nHe was an outstanding operator and mechanic.

His\nofficer-in-charge noted in 1989 that Applicant has diverse skills and a disciplined work\nethic. He was reliable and professional.2\nApplicant married in 1985. He and his wife have one son. His wife has problems\nwith alcohol and depression. His son has been arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana. He is currently attending a drug rehabilitative program. His son is now 21\nyears old.  \n3\nIn 1994, Applicant started his employment with a contractor. He has maintained a\nsecurity clearance since 1996. His employment record is outstanding. In 1995, he\nreceived the employee of the year award. Applicant has received cash awards. Again in\n2007, Applicant received the employee of the year award. His record is replete with\npraise and comments on his extraordinary performance. He is in charge of a mobile\nlaunch platform. He also has his Coast Guard Masters\u2019 License.4\n\nGE 1 (Security Application dated 1996).\n5\nTr. 106.\n6\nTr. 136.\n7\n3\nOn February 14, 1996, Applicant completed a security clearance application\nform. In response to Question 24, Applicant listed his marijuana use as April 1989. He\nreported his OTH discharge for the marijuana use on the form under Question 23\n(Police Record).  He did not disclose marijuana use subsequent to 1989.\n5\nIn May 2004, Applicant and his son drove to Florida for a vacation. Applicant was\nspeeding and was stopped by the police. When his son saw the police vehicle, he\nimmediately told Applicant that he had some marijuana in his possession. Applicant told\nhis son to give him the baggie of marijuana. He wanted to protect his son and did not\nwant to get his son in any trouble. The police smelled the marijuana in the car. Applicant\ntold the police officer that he had the marijuana. As a result, Applicant received a\ncitation and was charged with a misdemeanor, and possession of marijuana. After the\nincident, Applicant called an attorney because of potential difficulties with his security\nclearance. Applicant was told to make a $500 contribution to charity and after that the\ncharge was dismissed. The attorney advised Applicant it was taken care of and that he\nhad nothing to worry about.  Applicant understood that everything was dismissed and\n6\nthat there was nothing on his record, showing a conviction. \nOn June 12, 2006, Applicant completed his security clearance application form\nfor a top secret clearance. In response to Section 23 - Your Police Record, he answered\n\u201cno\u201d, that he had never been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to\nalcohol or drugs. He did not disclose the charge for the misdemeanor (marijuana\npossession) incident of May 2004.  He believed there was no obligation to disclose it\nbecause his attorney told him the charge was dismissed. His attorney did not advise\nhim about disclosure on his security clearance application. In fact, Applicant never\nappeared in court. On that same application form, Applicant made other errors\nunrelated to drug use. These errors were identified and corrected during the interview in\n2006.7\nDuring November and December 2006, Applicant spoke to investigators as part\nof his security investigation. He told the investigators that he did not have any\nalcohol/drug charges. He also expanded upon his admitted drug use, and told\ninvestigators in April 2007 that he smoked marijuana and last used it approximately\n1992.\nIn April 2007, Applicant again spoke with investigators about his admitted use of\nmarijuana in the past. Applicant disclosed that he recalls smoking randomly from 1979\nto 1992 but the exact date was not recalled as discussed above. On August 22, 2007,\nApplicant completed interrogatories concerning his previous drug use. He reported his\nlast use of marijuana was weekly in 1992. He stopped using marijuana due to his job\n\nGE 4 (Applicant\u2019s Response to Interrogatory, dated August 22, 2007).\n8\nTestimony of W itnesses at Tr. 24; 40; 56; 65; 78; and 86.\n9\n4\nresponsibility. He does not associate with anyone who uses drugs. He has no intention\nof using marijuana . Applicant marked a \u201c?\u201d Mark on the interrogatory, question 6,\nconcerning an arrest or charge and then explained the 2004 incident in Florida with his\nson. 8\nApplicant\u2019s current position is a challenging and demanding one. His colleagues\nand supervisors applaud him for his leadership and his integrity. He is open, honest,\nand loves his job. Applicant is subject to random drug tests from his employer and the\nCoast Guard.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n6\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana\nfrom 1979 to 1992. He admitted using marijuana  from 1979 to 1989, while in the U.S.\nNavy. He tested positive for marijuana in 1983 and again in 1989. He received an OTH\ncharacterization of his service in 1989 due to his marijuana use. In 1996, he falsely\nfailed to disclose his marijuana use on his SF 86, which was as recent as four years\nearlier. On November 1, 2004, he possessed marijuana that he received from his son,\nand provided to the police. There is substantial evidence that he failed to disclose the\n2004 marijuana possession on his 2006 SF 86. Such conduct, if known, adversely\naffects one\u2019s personal, professional and community standing. There is substantial\nevidence, establishing all the SOR allegations.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n\nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n10\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of\nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider\nthe record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.\n[Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had\nestablished a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted\nto the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n7\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to rebut the allegation that he deliberately\nfalsified his 2006 security clearance application.   When he responded to question 23\n10\nof his SF 86, concerning his police record, he believed that he was not required to\nreport the 2004 marijuana possession. His attorney advised him that the case was\ndismissed, and he was told that everything was resolved. He concluded erroneously\nthat he did not have to disclose the marijuana possession charge. I found him credible\nin his testimony about his honest, but mistaken belief. He was open and candid during\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an unfavorable\n11\nsecurity clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use was not\nmitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. In ISCR Case No. 04-\n09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board explained:\n[W ]here an applicant had extensive marijuana use and renewed marijuana use after periods\nof abstinence, a Judge may articulate a rational basis for doubts about whether the most\nrecent period of abstinence was sufficient to conclude the applicant had put marijuana use\nbehind them. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).\n8\nhis 2006 interview. In response to questions about drugs, Applicant was forthright and\nmentioned the 2004 incident with his son. He also was candid that he does not\nremember the specific date he last smoked marijuana, but believed it was in the 1990 to\n1992 time frame. His 2007 interrogatories report using marijuana weekly in 1992.\nApplicant has not used marijuana after 1992. I do not believe that he deliberately\nfalsified his 2006 SF 86.  Thus, the 2006 allegation of falsification of his SF 86 in SOR\nparagraph 1.g. is unsubstantiated under AG \u00b6 17(f).\nHe answered the 1996 SF 86 question about drug use in the last seven years by\nlisting the 1989 incident that caused his discharge from the Navy. He falsely failed to\ndisclose more recent marijuana use (up to around 1992). When he spoke to\ninvestigators in 2006, he was honest that he may have used after that time once or\ntwice. I found his testimony at the hearing credible.\nAG \u00b6 17(a) partially applies to mitigation the allegations of falsification of his SF\n86 concerning marijuana use.  He disclosed marijuana use that was much more\nextensive than could be proven.  He showed his good-faith in his disclosures of\nmarijuana use.  \n        AG \u00b6 17(b) partially applies to the omission of his 2004 marijuana possession\ncharge from his 2006 SF 86. The omission or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by advice of his legal counsel, who advised or instructed Applicant about\nhis offense. His lawyer did not advise him  specifically concerning the security clearance\nprocess, but he did tell him the charge was dismissed, and Applicant incorrectly\nassumed thereafter that he did not have to disclose it on his SF 86. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, Applicant cooperated\nfully and truthfully and disclosed the 2004 marijuana possession charge.\nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies to his marijuana use because his use of marijuana is a\nmisdemeanor, but more importantly the 1996 falsification of his SF 86, and his\nmarijuana use in 1992 and previously, is not recent.  So much time has passed that it\nhas little relevance to his current suitability for a security clearance.  Moreover, his\n11\ncircumstances have changed since his last marijuana use in 1992. I conclude marijuana\nuse and falsification of his SF 86 is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\n\n9\nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies because he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress through disclosure of his marijuana\nuse to security officials and to the Government.  Accordingly, he is no longer vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation or manipulation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for\nten years. During that time he received a commendation for outstanding service. He\nwas commended for his leadership, technical expertise and \u201ccan do\u201d spirit. His officer-\nin-charge in April 1989 recommended him for any position in operation, maintenance or\nmanagement of an engineering system. He received commendations for his leadership\nand outstanding efforts as an exceptional performer. However he used marijuana and\ntested positive in 1983 and 1989. He was separated from the Navy for using marijuana\nwith an OTH characterization of his service.\nApplicant stopped using marijuana around 1992. He does not have any\nassociation with persons who use drugs. He is a hardworking individual who is married\nwith one son. His wife has problems with depression and alcohol. His son uses\nmarijuana and is now receiving court-ordered treatment in a rehabilitative unit.\nApplicant is very protective of his wife and son. He is often away for work, but he takes\nhis family responsibilities very seriously.\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana ended in 1992. He falsified his 1996 security\nclearance application. He briefly possessed marijuana in 2004, when he accepted\nmarijuana from his son and passed it to the police, who has pulled them over for\nspeeding. He acknowledges and recognizes the security and employment impact of\n\n10\nsuch conduct. They do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment because his marijuana use and possession, and the falsification of his 1996\nSF 86 are unlikely to recur. Applicant has \u201cacknowledged\u201d his misbehavior and\nrecognizes the negative consequences of such conduct. Based primarily on the lack of\nmisconduct after 1996 (the 2004 marijuana possession was not to use the marijuana or\ndistribute it to others), he has reduced \u201cvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress\u201d through disclosure of his misconduct to security officials.\nIn 2004, Applicant took his son on a driving vacation to Florida. Applicant was\nstopped for speeding. His son, 18 years old, suddenly informed him that he had \u201cweed\u201d\non him. The Applicant did not want his son to get into any other trouble. So he told his\nson to give him the marijuana to protect his son. He provided the marijuana to the\npolice. Applicant was charged with marijuana possession. The charge was never\nprosecuted, and was dismissed without a court appearance. Based on the advice of an\nattorney, he believed the charge was non-existent and erroneously failed to disclose it\non his 2006 SF 86. \nApplicant\u2019s current employment has provided him with many opportunities for\nadvancement. He is well regarded by his supervisor and his colleagues. He has\nreceived numerous awards for his achievements. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 28, \n2006. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 5, 2007; answered it on \nOctober 16, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived his request on October 17, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on November 30, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 10, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 7, 2008, setting the case for \nApril 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFebruary 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the \nrecord open until March 10, 2008, to enable him to submit additional evidence.  \nApplicant timely submitted AX B and C, and they were admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s responses to AX B and C are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibits I and II.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 7, 2008. \nThe record closed on March 10, 2008. I received an email dated March 13, 2008, and \nmarked it as AX D, but I did not admit it because it was untimely.  Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 6, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \nwaived it (Tr. 23-25).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations. His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since May 2006.  He attended college for two years but \ndid not receive a degree (Tr. 7-8). He served in the U.S. Navy from March 1986 to \nMarch 2006, retiring as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7). He served as an alcohol \ncounselor in the Navy for a total of about six years (Tr. 43, 71). He has held a clearance \nsince March 1995. \n \n \nApplicant has been married since February 1987. He has two daughters, ages 19 \nand 17, and a 14-year-old son. His children live with him at home (Tr. 53). \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol while in college. While in the Navy, he \nusually consumed wine or beer on weekends with dinner (GX 4 at 2).  His normal \nconsumption was three or four drinks at a sitting (Tr. 76). He believed that it took about \nfive or six drinks to make him intoxicated (GX 6 at 2).   \n \n \nIn October 2001, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of \nalcohol (GX 5 at 3), after he drove across the center of the road into incoming traffic and \nhit two cars (Tr. 55). He testified he had consumed \u201cat least four\u201d mixed drinks (Tr. 55). \nHis breathalyzer test showed a blood-alcohol level above 2.0 (Tr. 56). He admitted he \nwas doing \u201ca lot of drinking\u201d during that period (Tr. 58). He testified the incident occurred \nbecause he was using alcohol to relieve severe back pain and depression (Answer to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR; Tr. 42-43). He was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $150, his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for 90 days, and he was required to attend a driver retraining course.  \nHe did not seek counseling or report the incident to his military unit, for fear of \njeopardizing his career (Tr. 57). \n \nSome time in 2004, Applicant had an argument with his wife and oldest daughter, \nafter the children returned late from a movie and came home with friends without \nnotifying their parents. His wife called the military police, and his commander imposed a \nmilitary protection order (Tr. 54, 69-70). The family argument was not alcohol-related. \n \nApplicant was upset by his family situation, and, in March 2005, after living \nseparately from his family for 5-6 months, he consumed alcohol to the point of \nintoxication while flying home from a duty assignment (Answer to SOR; Tr. 45). He \ntestified he began drinking at the departure airport, consumed \u201ca little alcohol\u201d on the \naircraft, and went to a bar after his flight landed (Tr. 58-59). He admitted he was \nimpaired \u201cto a certain point\u201d by his alcohol consumption (Tr. 60). He was stopped by \npolice after he crossed over the center line of the road. He failed a field sobriety test and \nrefused a breathalyzer test (Tr. 59-60). He was charged with refusal to take the \nbreathalyzer test. At his trial, he pleaded no contest and voluntarily disclosed his \nprevious alcohol-related conviction to the judge (Tr. 46). He was sentenced to a fine of \n$1,175, 20 hours of community service, and suspension of his driver\u2019s license for four \nmonths. He also was ordered to complete an alcohol treatment program (GX 4 at 5). He \nreceived nonjudicial punishment from his military commander for drunk driving, but the \npunishments were suspended (Tr. 66, 79). He went to sea about a week later, believing \nthat a court official would contact him about his community service (Tr. 46). He made no \ninquiries about scheduling his community service. \n \n \nApplicant was screened for substance abuse by the Navy in October 2001 and \nMay 2005 and diagnosed as not dependant on both occasions (GX 1 at 27). After his \narrest in March 2005, he decided to continue drinking moderately, limiting himself to two \nor three glasses of wine at dinner (GX 6 at 1-2). \n \nAfter Applicant retired in March 2006, he was unable to obtain a driver\u2019s license \nbecause he had not completed his community service. He finally completed it in \nJanuary-February 2007 (AX A; Answer to SOR). He decided to stop drinking, and had \nhis last drink on July 3, 2007, when he consumed three beers (GX 4 at 3). He began \nalcohol abuse treatment with a licensed clinical social worker on July 19, 2007, to \ncomply with the court order requiring him to complete an alcohol treatment program (GX \n4 at 4-5).   \n \nBy the time of the hearing, Applicant had met with the social worker about ten \ntimes (Tr. 68), but his treatment had not been completed because of his frequent, work-\nrelated travel. He was continuing to abstain from alcohol and had attended to Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings within two weeks of the hearing (Tr. 64). He did not have an \nAA sponsor, but he relied on his pastor for counseling and support (Tr. 51, 72; AX B at \n2). His social worker recommended that his initial participation in AA become \u201csustained \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand committed\u201d and that he establish a relationship with a sponsor to improve the \nlikelihood that he will maintain sobriety after the treatment is completed (AX B at 3).  \nApplicant testified his social worker believed he should stop drinking entirely because \notherwise it would only be a matter of time before there was another incident (Tr. 83). \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor for the past two years testified that Applicant works \nwithout direct supervision, travels frequently, and is on the road 20-30 percent of the \ntime. He described Applicant as dependable, trustworthy, and demonstrating a lot of \ninitiative (Tr. 30). Clients have frequently sent unsolicited feedback about Applicant\u2019s \nperformance, and it has been uniformly very positive (Tr. 37-38). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe SOR alleges an arrest and conviction for driving under the influence in \nOctober 2001 (\u00b6 1.a), an arrest and conviction for refusing a breathalyzer test in March \n2005 (\u00b6 1.b), and commencement of alcohol counseling in July 2007 (\u00b6 1.c). The \nsecurity concern relating to Guideline G is set out in AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201calcohol-related incidents away from \nwork, such as driving while under the influence . . , regardless of whether the individual \nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s two \nalcohol-related convictions raise this potentially disqualifying condition. \n \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. AG \u00b6 22(c). \u201cBinge drinking\u201d is \n\u201cthe consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.\u201d  U.S. Dept. \nof Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, The  National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Binge Drinking Among \nUnderage Persons, Apr. 11, 2002, available at http://www.oas.samhsa.gov.  Applicant\u2019s \nadmission that he consumed \u201cat least four\u201d mixed drinks before the October 2001 \nincident and was drinking \u201ca lot\u201d during this period strongly suggests habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol. Although the evidence is not conclusive on this point, it is more \nthan a scintilla and enough to be \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 22(c) is raised.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by an \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse \nor alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(f). The evaluation of alcohol abuse by \nthe licensed clinical social worker who is treating Applicant raises this disqualifying \ncondition. \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cfailure to follow any court order \nregarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(g).  \nAlthough Applicant was ordered in early 2005 to obtain treatment for alcohol abuse, he \ndid not begin his treatment until July 2007, more than two years later. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n22(g) is raised. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (f), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from alcohol consumption may be mitigated if \u201cso much \ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). Even though \nApplicant\u2019s last incident was more than three years ago, the first prong (\u201cso much time \nhas passed\u201d) is not established, because the record reflects habitual alcohol abuse \nbefore the October 2001 incident, an unsuccessful effort to moderate his drinking after \nthat incident, and failure to seek court-ordered treatment for more than two years after \nhis conviction in March 2005. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established, \nbecause his first alcohol-related conviction was preceded by frequent alcohol abuse, \nand he failed to moderate his drinking after his first conviction. The third prong (\u201cunusual \ncircumstances\u201d) is not established, because the circumstances of his alcohol abuse \nwere not unusual. The fourth prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is not established, because he \nhas not completed his alcohol abuse treatment and his social worker believes he needs \nto do more with AA to improve the likelihood of continued sobriety.  Finally, his alcohol \nconsumption casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \nbecause he continued to abuse alcohol after his first life-threatening incident, engaged \nin similar behavior in March 2005, and did not begin the court-ordered alcohol-abuse \ntreatment for more than two years. I conclude that AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG\u00b6 23(b).  Applicant has \nacknowledged his alcohol abuse and is undergoing treatment. However, he has \nconcluded that his efforts at responsible use are risky, and his social worker has \nconcurred.  His abstinence for seven months (as of the date of the hearing) is not long \n\n \n7 \n \n \nenough to establish a new \u201cpattern,\u201d when considered in the context of his record of \nalcohol abuse.  I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. \nSecurity concerns based on alcohol consumption may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment \nprogram, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(c). Although Applicant was required to attend driver retraining \nclasses after his first alcohol-related conviction, the classes were not an alcohol \ncounseling or treatment program, and his second conviction was not a relapse in the \nsense of this mitigating condition. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(c) is established. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if, \nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \nAG \u00b6 23(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not \ncompleted his treatment program, has not yet complied with his social worker\u2019s \naftercare recommendations, and has not yet received a favorable diagnosis. \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant \u201cbegan alcohol counseling\u201d with a licensed \nclinical social worker. It does not allege a diagnosis. Standing alone, entering into \nalcohol counseling is not a disqualifying condition. To the contrary, the mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), (c), and (d) are premised on obtaining counseling or \ntreatment.  I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the same conduct alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The \nconcern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30. Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime \nor multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a). Applicant\u2019s multiple convictions of alcohol-\nrelated crimes raise this disqualifying condition, shifting the burden to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). For the reasons \nset out above regarding AG \u00b6 23(a) under Guideline G, I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct also may be mitigated by \n\u201cevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). Applicant had abstained from alcohol for seven months and appeared to be \ngenuinely remorseful at the time of the hearing. He is well regarded by his supervisor. \nOn the other hand, he has been reluctant to acknowledge his alcohol abuse. He was \ndilatory in carrying out his court-ordered community service, and he has not yet \ncompleted his alcohol abuse treatment. I conclude insufficient time has passed to \ndetermine whether he is rehabilitated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult who held responsible positions in the Navy \nand has gained a good reputation in civilian life. He is the father of three children.  He \nhas held a clearance for many years. However, even though he spent six years as an \nalcohol counselor in the Navy, he engaged in life-threatening behavior in October 2001 \nand repeated it in March 2005, apparently not learning from his first experience. His \ndilatory approach to alcohol abuse treatment detracts from his expressions of remorse \nand statements of good intentions. Although he is a valuable employee with much to \noffer and has finally taken positive steps to avoid further alcohol abuse, he needs a \nlonger track record of responsible behavior to carry his burden of showing his current \n\n \n9 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37-E3.1.39 \n(reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 28, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was originally assigned to another \nadministrative judge and reassigned to me on November 16, 2007. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on November 20, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 13, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \non December 19, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Colombia. There was no objection to the request. The request \nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings \nof Fact below.  \n \n \nThe correct spelling of Applicant\u2019s middle name was changed on the original \nSOR due to a typographical error. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old master scheduler for a federal contractor. He was born \nin the U.S. to Colombian parents and moved to Colombia with his parents when he was \nvery young. He remained in Colombia where he grew up. He is a dual citizen of \nColombia and the U.S. Colombian law requires American citizens born in Colombia or \nwho otherwise have Colombian citizenship to have both a Colombian and U.S. \npassport. He possesses a Colombian passport and uses both his American passport \nand Colombian passport when traveling to Colombia.1 At the hearing, Applicant \ntranslated a document that was in Spanish that pertained to Colombian law that \nrequires dual citizens to comply with Colombian law.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are divorced. Both are citizens and residents of Colombia, as \nis his stepmother, sister and grandmother. His mother had worked for a government \nagency, but has since left its employment. His father owns a family business. Applicant \nowns shares in the business worth approximately $7,500.3 From 2001-2004, he \nreceived dividends from the shares. Applicant has a savings account in Colombia. He \nstated \u201cI do have a savings account of about $50. I don\u2019t use it. I just have it just, you \n \n1 Tr. 23-26; HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 25-26 \n \n3 Tr. 33-35. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nknow, for whatever. If someday I need to retire over there, I wanted a history of credit, \nso I just keep it.\u201d4 \n \n \nApplicant completed his primary, secondary and university education in \nColombia. After he graduated from college he was employed from 1997-1999 in \nColombia. He returned to the U.S. in 2000 to earn a master\u2019s degree in business from \nan American university, which he did. He likes where he lives in the U.S. and decided to \nstay. He does not know if he will return to Colombia in the future to reside.  \n \n \nApplicant returns to Colombia at least annually to visit his family and friends and \nfor special occasions. He has a close familial relationship with his immediate family and \nis in contact with them weekly. He has contact with his grandmother usually once a \nmonth. He also is in regular contact with his uncles. One uncle is the regional manager \nfor a Colombia bank and another is studying to be a professional officer in the \nColombian Air Force. He has two godchildren with whom he is close. Applicant contacts \nhis family by phone or email on a regular basis. In answers to interrogatories Applicant \nlisted 20 relatives (including those listed above) and 88 friends with foreign citizenship, \nmostly Colombian, with whom he maintains contact. The contact ranges from a couple \ntimes a year to daily.5 \n \n \nIn a statement made in July 2007, Applicant was unwilling to destroy, surrender \nor return his Colombian passport. He stated at his hearing \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to destroy \nit, but I was willing to surrender it\u2026. I haven\u2019t surrendered it yet, I asked the director of \nsecurity at [work] how that worked to see if I was supposed to surrender it to them ....\u201d6 \nApplicant still possesses his Colombian passport. When asked what his intention was \nhe stated, \u201cMy intention is, since I still need it whenever I go to Colombia, I asked the \nsecurity office if they had a place where, if I give it to them to hold it until I have to travel \nto Colombia, in which case, every time that there\u2019s an international trouble, I need to go \nand speak to them\u2026.\u201d7 He has not destroyed it or returned it to Colombian authorities, \nor otherwise invalidated it. He has not renounced his citizenship in Colombia and \nalthough he stated he was willing to do so, his demeanor was that it was with \nreluctance. \n \n \nApplicant voted in the Colombian elections in May 2006. When asked why he \nstated because it was his right to as a Colombian national.8 He further explained \u201cit was \na critical election because of all the problems with the guerrillas and the terrorism that \n \n4 Tr. 33. \n \n5 Tr. 35-36, 42; GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. 27. \n \n7 Tr. 27-28. \n \n8 Tr. 29-30. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwas affecting the country, the need for a strong president was vivid. So it\u2019s\u2014I figure, if I \ncould vote for the guy that was strongest, I would be helping, and so I did.\u201d9 \n \n \nApplicant provided three character letters that attested to his character and \nintegrity as a responsible and skillful employee. He is considered trustworthy, has the \nhighest degree of professionalism, and conducts himself in a courteous manner.10 \n \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy and the second most \npopulous country in South America. Any person born in Colombia is considered a \nColombian citizen. There are travel warnings for U.S. citizen by the Department of State \nhighlighting the dangers of violence by narcoterrorist groups and other criminal \nelements in Colombia. Foreigners continue to be victims of threats, kidnappings, and \nother criminal acts and there are severe restrictions on travel to and within Colombia for \nAmerican residing there for official duties. Victims of violence have included journalists, \nmissionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and tourists including children. The \nSecretary of State has designated three Colombian groups as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations that have carried out bombings and other attacks. They have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure, public recreation and modes of transportation. They have \nalso targeted civilians, government workers, politicians and soldiers. One terrorist \norganization has held three U.S. citizen government contractors as hostages since \n2003. The government of Colombia\u2019s record on human rights has improved, but there \nare still serious problems, including unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced \ndisappearances, insubordinate military collaboration with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, and other serious human rights abuses.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n9 Tr. 30. \n \n10 AE A, B and C.  \n \n11 HE I. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concerns involving foreign preference: When an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nI have considered all of the foreign preference disqualifying conditions and \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport \n. . . and (7) voting in a foreign election). Applicant continues to possess a valid \nColombian passport and voted in the 2006 Colombian election acknowledging it was his \nright to do so as a Colombian national. I find AG \u00b6 10(a) applies. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI have considered all of the foreign preference mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n11 and especially considered (a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship \nor birth in a foreign country), (b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce \ndual citizenship), (c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual \nwas a minor), (d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority), (e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated), and (f) (the vote in a foreign election was \nencouraged by the United States Government). \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship status is not based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship, \nbut is based on his exercising the rights of a Colombian citizen. He maintains his \nColombian passport and uses it to enter Colombia, which is required by law. It is a valid \npassport. He has not surrendered it. There is no evidence the use of his Colombian \npassport was approved by the cognizant security authority. His exercise of foreign \ncitizenship occurred while he was a U.S. citizen. Applicant also voted in a Colombia \nelection, as he believed was his right as a Colombian citizen. There was no evidence \nthat the U.S. government encouraged him to vote in the election. He reluctantly stated \nhe would renounce his Colombian citizenship. I find (b) applies. However, this mitigating \ncondition alone is not enough to overcome all the evidence which supports Applicant\u2019s \nforeign preference to Colombia. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nI have considered all of the foreign influence disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n7. I have especially considered (a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion), (b) (connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information), (e) (a \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has consistent and regular contact with his immediate family and \nnumerous family and many friends in Colombia. He has two family members who are \nquasi-connected to the government; one is a military student and the other an uncle \nwho works for a national bank. Applicant also has a nominal financial interest in a family \nowned and operated company and maintains a financial footprint in Colombia so he can \nestablish credit in the event he chooses to retire there. Although Applicant has many \nfamily and social connections in Colombia I do not have any evidence to conclude those \nconnections create a heightened risk or conflict of interest. I also find that the nominal \nfinancial interest Applicant has in Colombia does not create a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. Colombia is an ally in the war on terrorism and although they \nhave narcoterrorist organizations in their country, there is no evidence that they have \nattempted to obtain protected information. I find none of the foreign influence \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth, \nbut lived most of his life in Colombia. He maintains a Colombian passport and has voted \nin the Colombian presidential election in 2006. As he stated, it was his right as a \nColombian national to do so. Even though he stated he is willing to renounce his \nColombian citizenship, the other evidence clearly leads me to conclude he has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised under the foreign preference guideline. \n \n \nApplicant has strong family and social ties to Colombia, but there was not \nevidence to support that those ties created a heightened risk or a potential conflict of \ninterest. None of his family has close ties to the Colombian government. I find he has \nmitigated the security concerns raised under foreign influence.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-n: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2002. Applicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which are ongoing. The SOR alleges, and Applicant does not dispute, that he has 12 delinquent debts ranging from $34 to $6,621 for a total of about $12,274. The 12 debts include 7 unpaid medical accounts placed for collection for a total of $685 (SOR \u00b6 1.a).

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which are ongoing. He has done\nlittle to demonstrate that he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance\nis denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on July 27, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nApplicant replied to the SOR on August 22, 2007. He elected to have his case decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn September 27, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant\nand material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by him on October 15, 2007. He replied to the\nFORM with a one-page memorandum, dated October 17, 2007. The case was assigned to me\nNovember 2, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current\nemployer since October 2002. \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which are ongoing. The SOR\nalleges, and Applicant does not dispute, that he has 12 delinquent debts ranging from $34 to $6,621\nfor a total of about $12,274. The 12 debts include 7 unpaid medical accounts placed for collection\nfor a total of $685 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nApplicant\u2019s adverse financial history is established by a September 2006 credit report and\na July 2007 credit report (Exhibits 5 and 6). For example, the first credit report reveals one unpaid\njudgment for $1,597 and 17 collection accounts. The second credit report confirms Applicant\u2019s\nadverse financial history as of July 2007. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n3\nApplicant has been unable to repay any of the debts in the SOR or otherwise resolve his\nindebtedness. The debts were incurred during Applicant\u2019s marriage and he has since divorced. He\nhad hoped that his spouse would share in the responsibility to repay these debts, but it appears he is\nnow assuming responsibility for the debts.  His plan is to start repaying these debts with his\nanticipated tax returns next year. Other than his one-page memorandum in response to the FORM,\nApplicant did not provide any documentary information about the debts in the SOR.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n4\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems,\nwhich are ongoing. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates\ninability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n16\n17\nGuideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions. Also, the record evidence supports a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nhis favor. The most pertinent mitigating condition is MC 2\u2014conditions (to include a divorce) that\nresulted in the financial problems were largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014but it does not apply.\nAlthough he attributes his financial problems to his marriage, separation, and divorce, he did not\npresent sufficient evidence to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. On this\nskimpy record, this MC cannot be applied.  \nApplicant presented little in the way of favorable information, and his good intentions and\nfuture plans are not sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern raised by the government\u2019s\n\n5\nevidence. Indeed, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic approach for resolving his delinquent debts;\n(2) documented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a measurable improvement\nto his situation. At this point, it is likely that his history of financial problems will continue. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant had 21 past due accounts totaling approximately $109,000. He paid \nfive of the debts totaling approximately $55,000, but failed to document payment of the \nremaining 14 debts totaling $40,000. Applicant has failed to successfully mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 28, 2007, detailing security \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial \nproblems as shown by delinquent debts and Guideline E, personal conduct, for falsified \nmaterial on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \n  \n \nOn December 19, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated February 20, 2008. Applicant was \nsent a copy of the FORM, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions. \nOn May 29, 2008, Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel did not \nobject to the material. Applicant's response was admitted into the record. On June 9, \n2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.t. of the SOR. He denied the factual \nallegations in the remaining paragraphs of the SOR stating a number of the debts were \nduplicates of other listed debts. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. The admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old software engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since November 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother died of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2001 and his father died of \nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2002. Applicant was the primary care giver for his parents \nand moved in with them. During the same time period, Applicant was diagnosed with \ndiabetes, which caused him to incur medical expenses. For most of 2002, Applicant left \nwork and lived on his retirement savings, which resulted in tax penalties for early \nwithdrawal of his retirement funds. Applicant was unemployed in 2003 before moving to \nanother state to obtain a job. During the move, most of his financial records were lost \nand Applicant had difficulty in reconstructing his financial record. \n \nApplicant hired a financial specialist to help him resolve his financial liabilities, \njudgments, and incorrect credit report entries. He also hired a tax specialist. Applicant\u2019s \nFederal and state tax liens were paid when he sold his rental property. Applicant \nbelieves that a number of the entries on his credit report are not his, but belong to \nanother individual with a similar name. Other entries were inaccurate. (Item 5)  \n \nIn response to the financial interrogatories, Applicant submitted copies of a \nresidential loan application signed in August 2007. (Item 5) On page 3 of the form under \n\u201cLiabilities\u201d Applicant lists some of the same debts listed in the SOR. Specifically 11 \nSOR debts are listed: SOR \u00b6 1. b, $8,794 ($8,700 listed on the form); SOR \u00b6 1. d, \n$18,211 ($24,862 listed on form); SOR \u00b6 1. e, $1,836 ($2,377 listed on the form); SOR \n\u00b6 1. f, $3,144 (listed twice on the form); SOR \u00b6 1. g, $538 ($538 and $3,287 listed on \n\n \n \n \n3\nthe form); SOR \u00b6 1. h, $139; SOR \u00b6 1. k, $124; SOR \u00b6 1. p, $148; SOR \u00b6 1. q, $279; \nSOR \u00b6 1. r, $8,525; and, SOR \u00b6 1. s, $122. The documents indicate an application was \ncompleted. There is no documentation the application was accepted or that payment of \nthe listed obligations was made.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he asserts a financial service company was \neither disputing or negotiating with a number of the creditors. Applicant failed to \ndocument any outcome from disputes or negotiations on his behalf. He also asserts a \nnumber of the debts were removed from his credit report, but provided no credit report \ndocumenting the removal.  \n \nIn the sale of the rental property, the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. ($8,794), SOR \u00b6 \n1.n. ($2,838), and the state tax lien listed in both SOR \u00b6 1.o. ($12,606) and SOR \u00b6 1.t. \n($21,946) were paid. (See answer to SOR, Answer to FORM) The creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. ($18,211) is considering Applicant offer to settle for $9,105. The creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. ($14,816) has offered to settle the debt for $3,012. (Answer to FORM) There is no \nindication Applicant has accepted the offer or made payment in compliance with the \noffer.  \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a monthly personal financial statement \nshowing net monthly income of $9,952 and a net monthly remainder of $6,387. His \nannual yearly income was in excess of $120,000. (Item  5) Applicant owns a home \nworth $275,000 on which is owes $174,000. (Item  5) \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent accounts totaling $109,000. Applicant has paid \nfive debt totaling approximately $55,000. He indicates a number of the other debts have \nbeen paid, are duplicate debts, or have been removed from his credit report. However, \nno documentation supporting his assertions was provided. There is no evidence that 14 \ndebts totaling $40,000 have been paid.

(Items 7 and 8) \n \n \n \n \n \n$109621 \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n \nOn November 17, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), a Standard Form (SF) 86. (Item 4) In response to \nquestion 27 concerning his financial record he listed a $2,838 judgment entered in \n2005, a $12,606 state tax lien in 2005, and a $8,201 federal tax lien in 2002. He states: \n \nI have incurred multiple negative entries on my credit rating during the \ntime frame I was caring for both my Mother and Fathers (sic) cancer \ntreatments and subsequent deaths. . . During the time frame of about \n1998 through 2002 I did not pay particular attention to my finances like I \nshould have as I was just to (sic) pre-occupied with caring for my Mom \nand Dad. I am now working with my creditors to finalize balances due and \npayoff thee balances.  \n \nApplicant failed to state he had ever been more than 180 delinquent on any debt \nor was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt, but did state, \u201c[b]ack in \n1998-1999 I had a credit card account with [bank] that fell behind more than 180 days    \n\n \n \n \n6\n. . . I am currently disputing the amount owed. . . \u201c \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He owed 21 delinquent debts \ntotaling $109,000. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86 \n(Item 4), his credit reports (Items 7 and 8), the record of his judgments and recorded \nliens (Item 6), and in his residential loan application (Item 5) Throughout this process, \nhe admitted responsibility for a number of the delinquent debs. He provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show payment of other delinquent debts. The government established \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d \nand AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \n\n \n \n \n8\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant disputes owing a $75 utility bill (SOR & 1.u). The record fails to show \nthis debt is owed. I find for Applicant as to SOR & 1.u. \n \nApplicant=s financial problems were contributed to by his parent\u2019s death, he being \nthe primary care giver for his parents before their deaths, and his diabetes. This \noccurred between 1998 and 2002. His parent\u2019s deaths are events that will not recur, \nhowever, the debts do not appear to be related to the deaths other than he was \npreoccupied with more important matters. Only seven of the debts, totaling $1,000, \nwere medically related. AG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability.  \n \nThe death of Applicant\u2019s parents is something beyond one\u2019s control, however, it \nhas been over five years since their death. It is understandable Applicant\u2019s finances \nwere placed behind the more important task of primary care giver for his parents.  \nApplicant has acted responsibly in paying $55,000 on the five debts paid. However, \nthere is no documentation that 14 debts totaling $40,000 have been paid, which fails to \nshow responsible action. The applicability of AG & 20(b) is only partial.  \n \nApplicant has obtained the assistance of two tax specialists and was able to pay \nall past due tax obligations and the tax liens were satisfied. He also obtained the \nservices of a financial specialist for his other debts. There is no showing of financial \ncounseling. More important with no evidence of payment of the $40,000 of debt, \nApplicant fails to show the problem is under control or being resolved. AG & 20(c) does \nnot apply.  \n \nApplicant has paid five of the debts. AG & 20(d) clearly applies to these debts. \nAnother creditor (SOR & 1.m) has offered to settle a $14,816 debt for $3,000. However, \nthere is no evidence the offer was accepted or payment made in compliance with the \noffer. AG & 20(d) does not apply to the 14 unpaid debts.  \n \nThe two debts Applicant disputed, as evidenced by his credit report (Item 8), he \n\n \n \n \n9\neither paid or made an offer to pay. AG & 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, the concern is conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nThe allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct are unfounded. The \nGovernment has shown Applicant's answer to questions 27 and 29 were incomplete, \nbut this does not prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about his \nfinances. \nApplicant \nhas \ndenied \nintentional \nfalsification. \nDeliberate \nomission, \nconcealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement \nto the Government when applying for a security clearance is a security concern. But \nevery inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  \n \nThe purpose of the questionnaire is to inform the government of any adverse \nareas in Applicant\u2019s background. Applicant\u2019s responses on his SF 86 gave adequate \nnotice that he had multiple negative entries on his credit report and had not giving his \nfinances the proper care necessary when he acted as his parent\u2019s primary care giver \nwhen they were diagnoses and deaths. In response to question 27 concerning his \nfinances, he listed a judgment and two tax liens.  \n \nThese entries would have put any investigator on notice that Applicant had \nfinancial problems and Applicant\u2019s financial background needed to be closely reviewed. \nApplicant was not attempting to hide his financial problems. I am satisfied he did not \nintentionally falsify his SF 86. Accordingly, I find for Applicant as to the personal conduct \nsecurity concern.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n \n10\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. From the record it is not possible to \ndetermine the debts incurred were not the type indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, or that money was not \nspent frivolously. The record does show the two of the largest debt set forth in the SOR \nwere not incurred on luxuries, but were state tax liens.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s biggest problem is the record. He indicates a number of the debts \nhave been paid, are duplicate debts, or have been removed from his credit report. \nHowever, he provided no documentation supporting his asserts. There is no evidence \nthat the14 debts totaling $40,000 have been paid or were duplicates of any other debts.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise suitably addressed the obligations, he \nmay well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F, Financial: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n11\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nOn April 27, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP). \nOn February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about March 10, 2008, and waived his right to \na hearing. The Department subsequently exercised its right to request a hearing. DOHA \nFebruary 18, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nassigned the case to me on December 4, 2008, and issued a Notice of Hearing on \nDecember 16, 2008. The case was heard on January 14, 2009, as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one character witness, and offered exhibits (AE) A through M \ninto evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil January 28, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. \nOn January 27, 2009, Applicant submitted exhibits AE N through Z, which were \nadmitted into the record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his written Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations contained in \nParagraph 1, except those in Paragraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. He admitted the allegations \ncontained in Paragraph 2, but denied intentionally falsifying his security application. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and married. He and his wife have three children, ages \n16, 11 and 9. After completing high school, he started working in the aerospace \nindustry. In April 1996, he left to take over his uncle\u2019s automotive business. He owned \nand managed the business until April 2001, when he sold it because of a diminished \nincome and financial difficulties. He was earning about $30,000 per year. He then \nobtained another position in the aerospace industry, which required him to travel \nextensively. In October 2004, he started working for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor. He is a measurement technician and works on aircraft.  \n \n \n In April 2006, Applicant completed an e-QIP and was later granted an interim \nSecret clearance. In response to \u201cSection 27: Your Financial Delinquencies (c) In the \nlast 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or \nother debts,\u201d he failed to list the tax lien alleged in the SOR. In response to Section 27: \nYour Financial Delinquencies (d) In the last 7 years, have you had any judgment against \nyou that have not been paid, he answered \u201cno,\u201d and failed to list the judgment alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \n \nIn response to \u201cSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies (a). In the last 7 years, \nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d he answered \u201cno,\u201d and failed \nto list any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He did not disclose any debts in \nresponse to subparagraph b of this section, inquiring if, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you \nbeen over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \n \n  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his first security clearance application in 2006, he \nwas unaware of his delinquent debts and had never reviewed his credit bureau report \n(CBR). His company did not provide him any assistance when he completed the form. \n(Tr. 79) He did not intentionally fail to disclose his financial delinquencies to the \ngovernment. (Answer)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nSometime in late 2007, Applicant reviewed his CBR for the first time. He was \nvery surprised at the scope of his delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2000.  \n(GE 2) He attributes the delinquent debts to a failed business and extensive traveling for \nhis previous job. During the time that he was away from home, his wife handled the \nfinances along with all of the other household duties, resulting in unpaid bills and marital \ndifficulties. (Tr. 38-39) After learning of the financial situation, he immediately began \naddressing the delinquencies. (Tr. 42-43)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified and confirmed the underlying reasons leading to the \ndelinquent debts. She was responsible for taking care of their three children, handling \nthe household budget, and paying the bills while Applicant was gone. At times, she fell \nbehind in managing the finances and failed to tell Applicant about it. (Tr. 39; 72) Since \nworking for his current employer, Applicant no longer travels and has assumed \nresponsibility for paying the bills and managing the finances. Their marriage has also \nimproved. (Tr. 85-95)  \n \nBased on CBRs, dated October 2006, December 2007, March 2008, and \nJanuary 2009, the SOR alleged eleven debts, totaling about $15, 280. The status of the \ndebts is as follows:  \n \n1. The $181 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was owed to a cell phone company. It is \npaid. (GE 6) \n \n2. The $2,603 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is owed to a credit card company. \nApplicant paid $100 on January 23, 2009, leaving a balance of $2,499. He \nspoke to the company, which offered him a settlement for 50% of the balance. \nHe intends to pay the debt with his 2008 tax refund. (AE O; Tr. 44)     \n \n3. The $60 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was owed to a telephone company. It is \npaid. (GE 6) \n \n4. Applicant has formally disputed the $160 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (AE T) \n \n5. The $3,124 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was a tax lien. It has been paid and the \nlien is released. (AE I)  \n \n6. Applicant formally disputed the $170 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f because he \ndoes not recognize it. (AE R; Tr. 50)   \n \n7. The $160 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is paid. He called the company to obtain \na zero balance verification, but has not yet received it. (Tr. 51; AE P) \n \n8. Applicant was unfamiliar with the $33 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h and disputed \nit. (GE 3)    \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n9. Applicant disputed the $7,393 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He filed a complaint \nwith the appropriate attorney general\u2019s office, alleging that his payment of \n$350 previous resolved the car lease matter.1 (AE K; Tr. 52) It does not \nappear on the January 2009 CBR. (GE 6) \n \n10.  The April 2001 $600 default judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is owed to a \nprevious automotive customer and is unpaid. Applicant attempted to locate \nher to resolve the matter, but has been unable to find her. (Tr. 55) He \ndisputed it and it no longer appears on his January 2009 CBR. \n \n11. The $733 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is paid. (AE N)  \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has paid or taken steps to resolve the eleven debts. He is \nwilling and financially able to pay any of the debts he has disputed, should it be \ndetermined that he owes the debts. (Tr. 70-72) \n \n \nApplicant has assumed responsibility for paying the household bills. According to \nhis budget, he has a net monthly income of approximately $4,400 and expenses of \n$3,400, leaving approximately $1,000 for additional expense. (AE Y) Since assuming \nmanaging the finances, he routinely pays the bills on-line when they arrive. He has not \nincurred additional delinquent debt for a long time and uses only one credit card. (Tr. \n74) He believes his financial problems were limited to that period of time when he \nowned a business and later when he was traveling. He does not envision similar \nproblems occurring in the future. (Tr. 73)  \n  \n \nApplicant submitted a copy of his Performance Management Process for 2008. \nOverall, he has received good ratings and in some areas is \u201cexceeding expectations.\u201d \n(AE E) A colleague, for over seven years, considers him to be a loyal, dependable, and \nan asset to the unit. (AE D). A co-worker for five years commented on Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cupstanding work ethic and an extraordinary detail for quality.\u201d (AE W) Applicant\u2019s direct \nmanager for five years finds Applicant \u201cto be loyal, honorable, hardworking, dependable \nand highly skilled in his areas of expertise.\u201d (AE C) The plant manager is highly \nimpressed with Applicant\u2019s work relationships, skill and dedication. He wrote, \u201cI feel \nconfident in saying that he is capable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness, \nmaturity and level-headiness. He has consistently responded in many situations with \nethical and \u201ccommon sense\u201d solutions that were based on \u201cDoing the Right Thing\u201d for \nCustomer and Company.\u201d (AE B) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n                                            \n1The June 2006 and December 2007 CBRs provided by the Government list two separate lease \ndebts, one owed to LFG and one to Cit/Lease.  The Cit/Lease is paid or closed on each CBR. AE K \naddresses the LFG account listed in the SOR. Both are now resolved.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt between \n2000 and 2001 after his business failed and he then worked at a position, requiring him \nto travel and be away from home. Some of the debts were not addressed or resolved \nuntil 2008. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence supporting the two \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial indebtedness arose around 2000 when his business failed \nand later when he relied on his wife to manage the finances while traveling for work. \nAfter learning of the problems in late 2007, he began to address them. Both of those \ncircumstances are unlikely to occur in the future and do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) is applicable. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are attributable to a failed business, which was a situation beyond his control. \nHowever, there is no evidence that while accumulating the debts he took steps to \nmanage his obligations. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application. Although he has not \nobtained credit counseling, he has addressed the eleven debts listed in the SOR, and \nhis current budget is sufficient to cover any of the outstanding disputed debts. Thus, \nthere are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d \nwarranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant paid six of the eleven debts and is \nattempting to resolve the others. His actions demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve \nthe debts, triggering the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant disputed five debts and provided supporting documentation thereby \nestablishing the application of AG \u00b6 20(e). The record evidence does not support the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(f). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d that Applicant falsified \nanswers to four questions on his e-QIP, in that he failed to disclose debts over 90 and \n180 days old, a tax lien and a judgment. The Government contended that those \nomissions may raise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to include the information in the e-QIP, but denied \nthat he intentionally omitted the information.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant was unaware of the delinquencies until he reviewed his credit report for \nthe first time in December 2007, which was after he completed his e-QIP. Up to that \ntime, his wife had been managing the finances, and unbeknownst to him many of the \nbills had not been paid. Given his wife\u2019s candid testimony, confirming that she had not \ntold him about the debts, his explanation for not disclosing the financial information is \ncredible. The omission of the information was not intentional. Hence, the evidence does \nnot establish deliberate falsification. This Guideline is found in favor of Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 37-year-old man, who \nbegan experiencing financial difficulties between 2000 and 2001. Upon learning of the \ndelinquent debts, he promptly began addressing them, demonstrating his commitment \nto responsible financial management. According to both his supervisor and plant \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nmanager, he exhibits similar characteristics at work. His supervisor is aware of the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns, diminishing a potential for coercion or manipulation. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006), noted that \n\u201can applicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, \nonly that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has \u2018taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d Applicant\u2019s current income and budget are \nsolid, indicating that he appears to be living within his means and resolving his \nobligations. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations and \npersonal conduct guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:  For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nDepartment Counsel does not appeal the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline E.\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 4, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 10, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline F Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) found in \u00b6 20 of Enclosure\n2 of the Directive (\u00b6 E2.20) is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record evidence; and\nwhether her whole-person analysis is unsupported by the record evidence.   Finding error, we reverse\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s decision.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant married in 1997.\nHe and his wife separated and maintained two households for about a year in 2006 and then\nreconciled about four months before the hearing.  \nApplicant and his sister established an office cleaning business which was incorporated under\nstate law.  For incorporation purposes, the business had only two officers: Applicant\u2019s sister as\npresident and Applicant as operations manager.  The business operated out of Applicant\u2019s rental\nhome and ceased after three years.  Applicant\u2019s sister handled all the paperwork for the business, and\nshe did not inform Applicant of the outstanding tax issues of the business or her failure to properly\ndissolve the corporation.  Applicant was unaware of multiple state tax liens and one federal tax lien,\npossibly because he moved several times after closing the business.  When Applicant learned of one\nof the state tax liens, he resolved it in 2002; but he was still unaware of the other tax liens until he\nlearned of them, as well as other delinquencies, as part of the security clearance process.  In October\n2007, Applicant hired a tax representation firm to help him resolve his tax problems.\nAfter Applicant moved to another state in 2003, two events affected his financial situation\nin a negative way.  When Applicant\u2019s son caused a fire in the family\u2019s apartment, the management\n\n3\ncompany charged Applicant for the damages, and Applicant had no insurance to cover the cost.  In\n2006, Applicant was laid off as a truck driver when his employer ceased operations in his area.  In\naddition to Applicant\u2019s tax liens, the SOR includes three other debts.  In the past, Applicant\u2019s wife\nhas handled the family finances.  Applicant attributes his former lack of knowledge of his past-due\ndebts in part to that fact, and he is now playing a more active role in the family finances.  When he\nhas learned of the debts, he made some payments on them.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\n\n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n2\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d\n\u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n3\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under circumstances[.]\u201d\n4\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s financial situation raised security concerns.  Decision at\n7.  However, she found those concerns to be mitigated.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of mitigation are arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record evidence.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s arguments have merit.\nThe Judge applied FCMC 20(a).   The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s tax liens arose between\n2\nnine and 14 years ago and were the result of his former business, rather than failure to pay personal\nincome tax.  She found that liens were unlikely to recur, since Applicant no longer owns or operates\nhis own business.  Applicant provided no information about his former business.  Moreover, the\nfederal tax lien makes no mention of Applicant\u2019s former business, and Applicant testified that he did\nnot know whether the federal lien was personal or business-related.  Transcript at 31.  Applicant\nhired a tax representation company to help him settle his tax liens, but not until after he received the\nSOR; and he has presented no evidence that he or the company has yet taken any tangible steps to\nsettle them.  While Applicant indicates that he intends to pay off his debts, the Board has held that\nsuch statements of future intent to pay debts, without corroborating evidence such as consistent steps\nalready taken, are entitled to little weight.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-08410 at 3 (App. Bd. May\n8, 2002).  Applicant has very little in savings.  Moreover, he has submitted little concrete evidence\nof responsible conduct regarding his finances, and the evidence he submitted indicates that he has\ndifficulty in paying his monthly expenses on a regular basis.  \nThe Judge also found mitigation under FCMC 20(b).   In applying this mitigating condition,\n3\nthe Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment and the apartment fire which was caused\nby his son.  Board decisions indicate that not only the involuntary circumstances, but also an\napplicant\u2019s responses to the circumstances, must be considered.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-32606\n\n\u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\n4\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d \n \n\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d\n5\n5\nat 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2004).  As Department Counsel correctly notes, the fire occurred four years\nago, and Applicant was laid off over two years ago.  Moreover, he collected unemployment for the\n90 days he was unemployed.  He moved from the apartment building without leaving a forwarding\naddress.  Applicant took no action to settle the resulting debts until after he received the SOR.\nThe Judge applied FCMC 20(c),  in part because Applicant hired a tax representation firm\n4\nto help him settle his tax-related debts.  However, neither Applicant nor the firm presented any\nevidence of any action that has yet been taken to settle the debts.  The Judge also accepted\nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he had been making payments on his other debts without convincing\ndocumentation to prove his payments.  The Judge instructed Applicant to provide such\ndocumentation after the hearing.  The evidence Applicant submitted was entitled to little weight.\nAs evidence of payment, Applicant submitted a single month\u2019s bank statement which consisted of\na list of check numbers and amounts with little or no identification of the payees.  Applicant put a\nmark by eight of the check numbers.  Applicant has not demonstrated a history of payment of his\noutstanding debts; and the record demonstrates that his payment of standard monthly expenses is\nirregular, calling into question whether his financial problems are under control.\nThe Judge found mitigation under FCMC 20(d).   Applicant\u2019s limited efforts to pay or\n5\notherwise settle his debts have been discussed above.  The Judge found mitigation in the fact that\nApplicant has already resolved two state tax liens many years ago, although he has other state liens\nstill outstanding.  She also noted Applicant\u2019s promise to repay or settle with his creditors.  The\nlimited weight to be accorded such promises is discussed above.  \nThe Judge also discussed the age of the tax liens against Applicant, stating her view that the\nfederal government can only collect its lien for another year.  A security clearance adjudication is\nnot a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts.  Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Accordingly, even if a debt is\nlegally unenforceable, the government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to satisfy it in a timely manner.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 07-09966 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008).  The Judge\u2019s findings of mitigation are\narbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record evidence.\nThe Judge used the same conclusions in her whole-person analysis as she did in applying\nmitigating conditions.  As set forth above, those conclusions are not supported by the record\nevidence.  The Judge\u2019s analysis is therefore unsustainable. \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Y.

On October 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 16, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 25, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\n April 10, 2008\n\n2\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request in November 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 22, 2007. The case was originally\nassigned to another administrative judge on November 27, 2007 and reassigned to me\non December 10, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 22, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on February 12, 2008. The government offered ten\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted one exhibit (AE) A, which\nwas received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 21, 2008. I held the record open until March\n12, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On March 10, 2008, Applicant\nsubmitted 11 documents, which have been marked as AE B through L, and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. The record closed on March 12, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, I discussed the receipt of the hearing notice with Applicant. File\ninformation indicated he received the hearing notice on January 31, 2008, less than 15\ndays before the hearing. (Tr. 9.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the\nDirective to receive notice 15 days before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his\nright to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9-10.)\nThe government objects to the admission of AE A, a letter from a tax\nrepresentation firm, and a second letter from the same firm, dated February 18, 2008\nand marked as AE D, on the grounds of that both letters fail to provide proof of\nresolution of Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts. The government\u2019s objection is denied.\nThis evidence is relevant to the efforts taken by Applicant to resolve his delinquent tax\ndebt. \nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted an oral request at the hearing that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to the consequences of not dissolving a\ncorporation and submitted one document in support of her request. (Tr. 16-17.) The\nattached document was not admitted into evidence, but was included in the record as\nAdministrative Exhibit (Admin Ex) 1. The facts administratively noticed must be limited\nto matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The\nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g of the SOR, some with explanations.

His supervisors at both jobs praise his work skills and believe him to be an asset\nto the company. Applicant completed his security application (SF-86) on January 31,\n2007.1\nApplicant married in 1997. He and his wife separated for about a year sometime\nin 2006. This resulted in two households. They reconciled about four months prior to the\nhearing. They have a daughter, who is 9 years old. He has a 16-year-old stepson.\nApplicant attended college for two years, but did not graduate.2\nApplicant and his sister established an office cleaning business in an eastern\nstate. They incorporated the business under state law. The company named only two\nofficers in its incorporation documents: Applicant\u2019s sister as president and Applicant as\nthe operations manager. The company operated out of his rental home. The company\nacquired cleaning contracts, but in his position as operations manger, Applicant\nencountered significant difficulties in hiring and retaining sufficient numbers of\nemployees to meet the company\u2019s contractual obligations. After three years of\noperation, he and his sister closed the business.3\nAs president of the company, his sister\u2019s responsibilities included keeping the\nbusiness and financial records of the company, selling the business equipment after the\ncompany closed, and filing the appropriate papers to dissolve the company. Applicant\u2019s\nsister did not advise him about any tax issues with the company or her failure to file the\nappropriate dissolutionment papers. He knew about one tax issue, which he resolved\nwith the state in 2002. He did not know about any other state tax issues or a federal tax\nissue related to the business until recently. He files his personal income taxes every\nyear and has no outstanding federal or state tax issues concerning his personal taxes.\nHe never received notice of the tax deficiencies.  He hired a tax representation firm in\n4\nOctober 2007 to work with him on resolving his tax problems.5\nApplicant moved across the country in July 2003. Since moving, two factors\nimpacted his finances. A fire occurred in the apartment Applicant and his family rented.\nBecause his son caused the fire, the apartment complex charged him for the damage.\n\nTr. 45-46, 49.\n6\nGE 10 (Financial interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s response with attachments) at 8-11, 12-16; AE H (Pay stubs\n7\nfor current job); AE I (Pay stubs for part-time job).\nGE 2 (Credit Report, dated July 23, 2007) at 1; GE 3 (Credit report, dated March 8, 2007) at 3-4; GE 4\n8\n(LexisNexis listing of state tax lien for 1995); GE 5 (LexisNexis listing of state tax lien for 1996); GE 6\n(LexisNexis listing of state tax lien for September 1997); GE 8 (LexisNexis listing of state tax lien for 1994);\nGE 9 (LexisNexis listing of state tax lien for March 1997); GE 10, supra note 7, at 4.\nGE 2, supra note 8, at 1; GE 3, supra note 8, at 3-4; GE 7 (LexisNexis listing of federal tax lien for 1999); GE\n9\n10, supra note 7, at 4.\n4\nHe did not have rental insurance. In 2006, Applicant lost his job as a truck driver when\nthe company closed its stores in his metropolitan work area.  \n6\nApplicant currently earns approximately $3,350 a month in gross salary and\n$2,750 a month in net income. His wife\u2019s net monthly income is $2,300 for a total net\nhousehold monthly income of approximately $5,050. Their monthly expenses total\napproximately $3,600, leaving $1,400 for debt payment or other expenses.7\nThe State in which Applicant operated his business obtained judgments and filed\na tax lien for $2,800 in 1994, a tax lien for $53,253 in 1995, a tax lien for $3,256 in 1996,\na tax lien for $24,000 in March 1997 and three tax liens for $13,200 in 1997.  Applicant\u2019s\ncredit report dated March 8, 2007 shows a state tax lien for $13,600, with court case\nnumbers 12326199, 990000123261, and 123621. Two of listings are marked released\nbut the third listing is not marked released. The July 2007 credit report contains one\nlisting of a state tax lien for $13,600 with case number 123621, which has been\nreleased. I find that there is one tax lien, not four, for $13,200, which has been released\nby the State because it is paid. The record also contains evidence of a judgment for\n$24,000 obtained by the State against Applicant in March 1997. He  paid this judgment\nin 2002 and keeps the payment notice at hand. These debts arise out of the business\nhe and his sister operated.8\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also filed a tax lien in 1999 for $12,753. The\ncomputer documents of record (GE4-GE9) indicate that tax liens have been filed, but do\nnot reflect that two tax liens have been paid. This inaccuracy as to the paid status of two\nliens leads me to question the accuracy and completeness of the remaining computer\ndocuments, concerning the payment status of the liens. The credit reports show some\ntax liens, but do not list all tax liens or tax judgments. The credit reports indicate one lien\nhas been released, but do not contain any reference to the existence or payment of the\n$24,000 lien. The credit reports are incomplete based on the liens filed by the State.  \n9\nBased on the documentation provided to him in 2002 by the State, Applicant\nbelieved that he had resolved all the tax issues related to the business he operated in\nthe mid-1990s. Until he received a copy of his credit reports as part of his security\nclearance investigation, he did not know he still had outstanding tax liens. He does not\n\n AE J (Checking account statement from December 21, 2007 through February 27, 2008 showing monthly\n10\npayments to the tax firm); Tr. 31-32, 60, 62.\nGE 10, supra note 7, at 5-13; AE E (Statement from credit card company, dated January 15, 2008); AE F\n11\n(Payment on bill); AE G (Bill showing payment); AE J, supra note 10; Tr. 34-38, 42, 52.\nId.\n12\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra note 2, at 1, 10-11.\n13\n5\ndeny the existence of the liens and his or his defunct corporations\u2019s indebtedness based\non the liens or that several are not paid.

Citing to its privacy policy, this firm\nhas declined to provide any details about the steps it has taken or will take on behalf of\nthe Applicant regarding his outstanding tax issues. He will make an offer of compromise\nto the IRS equal to the money in his 401K account. If this is not accepted, he will make\nmonthly payments until this debt is paid. His sister is also working on the lien issue and\nhe believes she may resolve the State liens, but no evidence currently exists to indicate\nthat she has resolved the State liens.10\nThe SOR lists three other debts. Because his wife managed the family finances,\nApplicant did not know a $2,815 judgment had been entered against him in November\n2004. He  negotiated a repayment plan and pays $80 a month towards this debt. His\npayments began in September 2007. He has made at least three payments on this\ndebt.  \n11\nApplicant incurred $2,000 in credit card debt. He negotiated a repayment plan on\nthis debt. He pays $60 a month. The January statement from the creditor indicates that\nhis unpaid balance as of January 15, 2008 was $905. He made a $60 payment in\nFebruary 2008. The remaining collection account in the SOR relates to the fire damages\nat his former residence. He also negotiated a repayment plan of $200 a month. He has\nmade at least three payments for a total of $600. He pays his other bills. He does not\nnecessarily pay an entire bill in a month and sometimes he may not pay a bill, but he\nhas not allowed his bills to accumulate over a long period of time. He is taking a more\nactive role in managing and paying the household bills.12\nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SF 86) on January 31,\n2007. He answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the following questions:13\nQuestion 28a. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 days\nIn the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\nQuestion 28b. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt?\n\nGE 1 supra note 1, at 8-9; Tr. 45, 52, 69, 71-72.\n14\nAdmin Ex 1.\n15\n6\nQuestion 27d. Your Financial Record\nIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you\nthat have not been paid?\nApplicant did not list the tax judgments arising from his business, nor did he list the one\ncivil judgement against him. He did not identify any old debts as he did not realize that\nhis bills had not been paid. His wife managed the household finances and he did not\nactively participate in managing household accounts. He did not acknowledge the tax\nliens because he believed he had resolved all his old tax issues years earlier based on\nthe letter he received from the state. He now actively manages the household\nfinances.14\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Under State law, a corporation\nwhich ceases doing business must be dissolved through the Division of Revenue to\navoid future business taxes, penalties and interest.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n7\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant and his sister developed and incorporated a business in\nthe 1990s. After three years of operation, they closed the business. As a result of their\nbusiness venture, Applicant, and his sister, have unpaid state tax liens and judgment\nfrom 1994 through 1996, and one unpaid IRS debt. More recently, he accumulated\n$4,300 in delinquent debt and $2,800 in an unpaid judgment. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n8\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s tax\nliabilities arise from a business he and his sister operated in the 1990s. All of his tax\nissues stem from this business, not from his failure to pay his personal income taxes.\nHis state tax liabilities are 12 to 14 years old. His federal tax debt is nine years old. His\ntax issues are not likely to reoccur as he no longer operates a business, but works for\nothers. His other unpaid debts are more recent. Because he resolved at least two of his\nstate tax liens many years ago and he files and pays his personal income taxes, the\nunpaid taxes from years ago do not raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition has some\napplicability. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s tax liability is\na result of business management issues and decisions, which are matters not beyond\nhis control. His more recent debt issues arose, in part, because he lost his job in 2006\nand as a result of the negligent actions of his son in causing the fire in his apartment.\nThis mitigating condition may have some applicability.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant hired a tax representation firm to\nhelp him resolve his old, unpaid tax debts. Although the firm refused to provide\ninformation regarding the counseling and actions it is taking on his behalf, clearly he is\nrelying on its expertise to help resolve his tax issues. He is not avoiding this problem.\nConcerning the 2004 judgment, Applicant is paying $80 a month on this debt. Likewise,\nhe pays $200 to the collection company for the fire damage and $60 a month on the\ncredit card debt. His credit debt has been reduced by $1,200, which is more than one-\nhalf of the original debt. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies.\n Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\ntax issues are significant, particularly his state tax liens. He has not ignored this problem\nnor has he failed to file his personal income taxes. Rather, his tax liabilities arose\nbecause he and his sister did not properly manage the cleaning business and its related\ntax liabilities. Many years ago, he resolved two state tax liens/ judgments, totaling\n$37,000. When he paid a lien in 2002, he believed that he had paid all his back taxes to\nthe State. At this time, the State had an opportunity to notify him of more liens and\ndevelop payment plans with him. It did not for reasons unknown. Thus, his belief that he\nhad resolved all his state tax liens and judgments is reasonable. When he learned last\nsummer that state tax judgments still existed, he retained the services of a firm\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this decision to render an opinion as to whether the IRS tax debt is Applicant\u2019s\n16\nbecause the incorporated business no longer exists (piercing the corporate veil) or is a debt of the corporation\nonly. Applicant is willing to make an offer of compromise or pay this debt should he personally owe it.\n9\nspecializing in tax representation to help him resolve these outstanding tax issues. At\nthis time, he is paying the firm to develop a resolution of his tax problems. A final\nresolution has not yet taken place. \nAs a general rule, the IRS must prepare and file an assessment of income tax it\nbelieves due within three years after the return is filed. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a). Once\nan assessment is complete, it has 60 days to give notice and a demand for payment of\nthe tax due to the person liable. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a). Once the notice and demand\nare made, a lien in favor of the United States automatically arises. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\n6321. The IRS must file a levy or institute court proceedings within 10 years after the tax\nassessment to collect the tax lien. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602(a)(1); United States v. Galletti,\n541 U.S. 114, 119 (2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a\nbankruptcy proceeding, see United States v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d (S.D. Ohio 2006), by\nagreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see United States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101,\n1106(11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or after Dec. 31, 1999)\nis pending. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(a) provides for abatement of an assessment when it is\nuncollectible. The state law also generally follows the 3-year and 10-year statute of\nlimitations used by the IRS. See Code \u00a7 12-54-85. Whether the IRS followed all of its\nrequired procedures before filing the lien in 1999 is not known. At this point, the IRS has\nnot filed a levy or instituted court proceedings to enforce its lien nor does the record\ncontain any evidence that the IRS is taking any refund from his individual taxes to repay\nthis debt. It has another year to seek recovery of this debt owed by the now defunct\ncleaning corporation.16\nHe pays his household expenses, although not always in full every month. Some\nof his household accounts were behind and he is successfully working to bring these\naccounts current. He is not required to pay his monthly bills in full every month. He is\nrequired to manage his finances, and he is doing so. He now takes a more active role in\nmanaging the household finances to make sure that financial problems do not arise in\nthe future. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) is raised.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b)-16(g) are not raised in this case.\n17\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n18\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\nAlthough the following conduct will normally result in an unfavorable clearance\naction or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility, this\nconduct is not at issue in this case:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing condition may be disqualifying in this case:17\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 27d, 28a and 28b about his past tax liabilities and\njudgments, as well as information about his unpaid debts in more recent years. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be\ndeliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the\ntime the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish\n18\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified about his lack of knowledge about his past tax\nliabilities and his failure to keep himself apprised of his family finances. He also candidly\nacknowledged that he did not seek assistance when completing his SF-86. In response\nto the government\u2019s interrogatories, he provided information regarding his personal\nfinances and his tax liens. He is not attempting to hide his debts. He simply did not\n\n11\nknow the extent of his problems. The government has not established that he\ndeliberately falsified his SF-86.\nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s unpaid tax debts are\nsignificant. He did not decide that he would not pay the debts nor has he deliberately\nignored these debts which arose out his now defunct business enterprise. He and his\nsister divided up the various functions of their cleaning business. He ran the business\noperations, which included obtaining work contracts, hiring staff, and cleaning office\nbuildings. His sister\u2019s duties focused on managing the financial and administrative\naspects of the business. He failed to keep himself informed about his sister\u2019s\nmanagement of her responsibilities. He does not know if she filed the proper documents\nto close the business; however, as a result of the business shutdown, tax debts for the\nyears 1994-1996 exist with the state and a 1999 federal tax debt exists. He paid two\nstate tax liens many years ago. When he paid the second tax lien in 2002, he believed\nthat he had resolved all his debts with the State. He has not received any further\nnotification from the State the he owed more money. He wants to resolve this matter\nand has hired a tax consulting firm to help resolve this issue. Likewise, he did not know\nabout the federal tax lien, which the federal government has not sought to enforce. As\nwith the State liens, he wants to resolve it with the assistance of the tax consulting firm. \nHe assumed responsibility for his other three debts by negotiating a repayment\nplan with each creditor in September 2007. Since then, he has reduced one debt by\n60%, and a second debt by 25%. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to\npay or resolve these delinquent debts and to organize his household finances. His\nhousehold bills cannot be a source of improper pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\n\n12\nduress because he is managing these bills. He acknowledges the old tax liens and is\nworking to resolve them. Thus, these debts cannot be a potential source for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. Since he and his sister closed their business many\nyears ago, and he has chosen to work for companies since then, there is little likelihood\nthat he will incur this type of tax debt in the future. Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all his debts are paid; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. While his significant tax debts are\nunresolved, he is not ignoring the problem nor has he ignored his more recent unpaid\ndebts. He is taking responsibility for all. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 22,\n2006. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 19, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-9), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in her own\nbehalf, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Exhibit (AE A), without\nJuly 8, 2008\n\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript on June 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the\nrecord, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, of the SOR. She provided additional information to\nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1999, she attended college for a brief period. In December 2000,\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where she remained on active duty until June\n2004.  She has worked for her current employer since late 2006 (Tr. 17).\nApplicant married her husband in 2003 while both were in the military. Their first\nchild was born in March 2003. Applicant and her husband left the Air Force in 2004. At\nthat time Applicant was six months pregnant with their second child. They resided with\nApplicant\u2019s parents until they could find employment. Applicant could not find a job\ninitially because she was six months pregnant (Tr. 8). She remained unemployed until\n2006. Initially, her husband worked sporadically at odd jobs. However, approximately\nthree weeks after they returned home, Applicant\u2019s husband left her.\nApplicant did not hear from her husband and had no idea where he was living.\nHer second child was born January 3, 2005. Applicant did not have any employment\nand was forced to go on welfare. She cared for herself and her two children with some\nhelp from her family. At that time she began to fall behind in her payment of bills.\nApplicant and her husband had purchased a vehicle for the family use during the\nmarriage. Applicant co-signed the automobile loan. When her husband left, he took the\nautomobile with him (Tr. 15). Applicant bought furniture for the children and had various\nmedical and daily expenses. Her husband did not send any money to support them.\nApplicant\u2019s husband returned at some point and they attempted to reconcile the\nmarriage for the good of the children. Applicant again became pregnant. Her husband\nleft the home again. Applicant learned that he was unfaithful to her. She decided to\ndivorce him. While they were separated, their third child was born in March 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s divorce will occur next month (Tr. 18). \nApplicant was paying on the car payment until she could no longer afford the\npayments. Her husband still had possession of the car. Applicant moved to a small\napartment and left her parents when her husband returned. However, she could not\nafford the rent when he left again. Applicant and her children moved back to her\nparents\u2019 home. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s third child was born with complications. She could not return to work\nimmediately and fell behind in payments. She also incurred medical and hospital\nexpenses. \nShe returned to work in late 2006. She paid several bills. Her husband did not\nhelp with the bills. She has not heard from him since January 2008. Applicant is\nconcerned about her credit and financial status. She wants to go back to school to\nimprove her job opportunities. \nHer father testified at the hearing that Applicant has been working at her current\njob and has not received any support from her soon-to-be-exhusband. He and his wife\nare helping Applicant with expenses and child care so that Applicant can work (Tr. 26).\nApplicant\u2019s father confirmed that Applicant\u2019s husband disappeared. He also confirmed\nthat Applicant left her parents\u2019 home to rent an apartment when her husband returned\nthe first time. She had to move back with her parents when the lease was up so that she\ncould stay employed and care for her children (Tr. 27).\n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts, including an involuntary repossession\nof a vehicle. The total amount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $11, 242\n(GE 2). SOR debt \u00b6 1.a is in the amount of $63 for a medical account in collection. SOR\ndebt \u00b6 1.b is in the amount of $909 for a charged off credit account; and SOR debt \u00b6 1.c\nis in the amount of $10,270 for an involuntary repossession of an automobile.\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: two debts are\npaid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a. and 1.b) (attachments to answer in file). When Applicant first learned\nabout the car repossession, she called the creditor and agreed to settle the account for\n$2,984.67 (Tr. 21) She arranged three payments of $994.89. The final payment is due\nAugust 31, 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $2,800. After monthly expenses and\ncurrent debt payments, she has a net remainder of $800 (Tr. 25). She does not use\ncredit cards.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\n4\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt in 2004 and could not meet\nher financial obligations. The family car was repossessed after her husband took the\nautomobile. The credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2004 when she and her husband left the military. Her husband\nleft her when she was pregnant and unemployed with one child. Applicant paid her daily\nexpenses but could not manage all the bills. While those circumstances may have\nprecipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. She acted responsibly. Her\nconduct over the last six months with her creditors removes security concerns and\ndoubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She has one\noutstanding delinquent debt which is in repayment status. This potentially mitigating\ncondition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, her\nfinancial problems  arose when her husband disappeared and took the car. He left her\nand their child. Applicant was unemployed as she had just left the military and was\npregnant. After she became re-employed, she acted responsibly in identifying and\nresolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid two debts and has a plan for the repossession.\nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions partially apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\n6\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a young woman. She served in the\nmilitary for a number of years. She graduated from high school and attended college for\na brief period. She had no financial difficulties until her marriage.\nApplicant married while in the military. Applicant was pregnant with her second\nchild when she left the military in 2004. She could not immediately gain employment\ndue to her condition. \nApplicant\u2019s husband left her and the children several times. He did not work at\nsteady employment and did not support the family. Applicant had to live with her parents\nso that she could maintain herself and her children. Applicant\u2019s husband took the family\ncar and left Applicant to make the payments. \nApplicant has been gainfully employed for the past year and a half. She is\ncurrently living with her parents. They are helping her to care for her children. She will\nsoon be divorced. She has acted responsibly in her situation. She paid two debts that\nwere alleged in the SOR. She is currently paying on the last debt. She is living a frugal\nlife. She is not living beyond her means. She hopes to continue her education to better\nher future job opportunities. She met her burden of proof with respect to security\nconcerns under the financial guideline.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without question or doubt as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

WHITE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCandace Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He still owes a significant\nnumber and amount of delinquent debts that he accrued since closing his business and accepting his\ncurrent job in late 2003. He has a $600 monthly deficit of income to recurring expenses, and no plan\nto bring the situation under control. He did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application,\nbut security concerns raised by financial considerations were not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (August 2006) as\n1\nimplemented by Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum of Aug. 30, 2006 for use in adjudication of all cases in which\nan SOR had not been issued by Sept 1, 2006. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant with the SOR.\n2\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on November 15, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as a safety coordinator. On September 24, 2007, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The\nSOR detailed reasons, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary\n1\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\na security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter, dated October 15, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of some of the allegations and denying others, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was then assigned to me on November 1, 2007. A Notice\nof Hearing was issued on November 7, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on December\n3, 2007. During the hearing, the Government offered nine exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered one\nexhibit that was admitted without objection and marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The record was\nkept open until December 10 to permit submission of additional evidence. Applicant submitted one\nadditional exhibit, to which Department Counsel had no objection, that was admitted as AE B.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant formally admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\nthrough 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.s, pertaining to financial considerations under AG F. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegations under\nAG F, and the allegation under AG E in \u00b6 2, in his response to the SOR. After a complete and\nthorough review of all the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security\nclearance. He previously held a clearance while serving in the Navy from 1979 to 1994. He is\nmarried, with three children, ages four, two and three months. His wife does not work outside the\nhome. He took a voluntary early retirement from the Navy, and, after deductions including a $188\nallotment toward one of his debts, he receives $535 per month in combined retirement pay and VA\ncompensation each month. He has worked in his present job since December 2003, and earns\napproximately $1,000 every two weeks. He owns his home, with monthly mortgage payments of\n$1,000. \nFrom 2000 until November 2003, Applicant and his wife operated a business delivering\nappliances for a major retail store. During that period, Applicant earned $3,500 to $4,000 every two\n\n3\nweeks. Their current financial troubles began when they closed the business and he started working\nat his current job with substantially reduced income. He closed the business because of increased fuel\ncosts and having to fire his assistant over drug use. Since that time, Applicant has incurred increasing\namounts of delinquent debt. His monthly expenses exceed income by more than $600, without any\nallowance for repayment of delinquent debts. He is two months behind on his mortgage payments,\nand plans to apply for an assistance grant from the local housing authority to help with the arrearage.\nHe has consulted an attorney about filing for bankruptcy, but cannot afford to do that until he\nreceives his federal income tax refund next year. (Tr. at 27-37). \nApplicant and his wife previously filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 1991, involving\nabout $19,000 in debts. This bankruptcy proceeding was discharged in 1995. These circumstances\narose while he was still on active duty in the Navy, were fully resolved at the time, and bear little\nrelevance to Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. Applicant did have a civil judgment entered\nagainst him, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q, but that was paid back in 2004 and no longer appears on his\ncredit reports.\nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.i, because he contacted both\ncreditors and neither had a record of his account. He submitted a formal dispute to the credit bureaus\nwith respect to each. He also claimed that he repaid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which his credit\nreport shows as a charge-off with a zero balance due. He is making monthly payments of $188 by\nallotment from his retirement check toward the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which is not\ndelinquent.(AE B.) He admitted the remaining delinquent debt alleged in the SOR and reflected on\nhis credit bureau reports (GEs 5, 6, 7 and 8). These debts total $19,714. He is current on his property\ntaxes, after making a late payment in April 2007 from his federal income tax refund. (GE 2 at 5, 8;\nTr. at 43, 56-59.) \nWhen Applicant filled out his security clearance application, he left the yes and no blocks\nblank in response to question 28a, concerning 180-day delinquent debt. Instead, he wrote\n\u201cUNCERTAIN\u201d next to the blocks. (See AE A at 9.) He turned the application in to his company\u2019s\nsecurity manager, who input the data into an electronic questionnaire. Applicant was asked to sign\nthe signature page of the electronic version without checking the contents. The security manager\nentered a \u201cNo\u201d answer on the electronic form without Applicant\u2019s knowledge. (See GE 1 at 31.)\nPOLICIES            \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be\nconsidered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the AG are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, under\nGuideline F and E, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\n\nA G \u00b6 2.\n2\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n3\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n4\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n5\n4\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n2\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n3\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n4\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d  \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n5\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n6\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n7\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nAG \u00b6 18.\n8\n5\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n6\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n7\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and\nimpartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\nunfavorable. The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFinancial considerations raise security concerns when a person has significant\ndelinquent debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d8\nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC), and\nfind that FC DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply to Applicant\u2019s situation and raise security concerns. He\nadmittedly owes almost $20,000 in SOR-alleged delinquent debts, which he has neither the means\n\n6\nnor intention to repay. His monthly income is $600 less than his recurring expenses, making his\nfinancial situation continually worse. No other FC DC applies. \nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) that\nmight apply to Applicant\u2019s inability to meet, and history of not meeting, his financial obligations.\nFC MC 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply since his delinquent indebtedness\ncontinues to date.\nFC MC 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d)\napplies to some degree. Applicant chose to close a business that was generating three to four times\nmore income than his current job. His stated reason was that fuel costs rose, which would only make\nsense if those fuel costs substantially reduced his ability to continue generating that income. He did\nobtain his present employment shortly thereafter, but has continued incurring additional delinquent\ndebt with no plan to turn the situation around. Accordingly, the pressures resulting from the\ndelinquent indebtedness and a bad credit rating remain. \nFC MC 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) was not established\nby Applicant. He said that a VA counselor worked out a budget for him several years ago showing\nthe $600 monthly deficit. He did not obtain or follow financial counseling to resolve the situation,\nhowever. \nFC MC 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d) also does not apply to mitigate security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation. He showed that he is making regular payments toward one SOR-alleged debt, and is\ndisputing two others. His only potential plan to address the rest is a possible bankruptcy filing\nsometime next year.\nApplicant disputes the legitimacy of some of his reported past-due debts, but presented no\ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the disputes, or actions to resolve them. Accordingly, FC\nMC 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) does not mitigate security concerns, even with\nrespect to the portion of the indebtedness he disputes. No unexplained affluence concerns were\nraised, so FC MC 20(f) has no bearing in this case.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n9\n7\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d9\nThe Regulation\u2019s personal conduct guideline requires deliberate omission, concealment or\nfalsification of relevant facts to establish Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a)\n(\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Appellant provided an accurate answer of\n\u201cUNCERTAIN\u201d when he completed his security clearance application, but his security manager\nchange it to \u201cNo\u201d on the electronic application form that was submitted to the government. Applicant\nwas not aware of this incorrect answer, so no security concerns arise from this allegation.\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. The nature, extent, and seriousness of his delinquent\nindebtedness is not under control, and is getting worse as time passes. Applicant is a mature,\neducated adult who chose to close a business and accept his current employment, and offered no\nreason he should not be considered accountable for his voluntary actions. He produced no evidence\nof rehabilitation or other permanent behavioral changes. The evidence shows that continuation and\nworsening of these problems is highly probable into the foreseeable future. Accordingly, I find that\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the financial considerations set forth in\nthe SOR. It is not clearly in the interest of national security to grant him access to classified material.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, GUIDELINE F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, GUIDELINE E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On \nJune 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 11, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about August 4, 2008, and waived his right to \na hearing. In accordance with Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural Guidance \nat Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6, Department Counsel requested a hearing. \n(Hearing Exhibit 1)  DOHA assigned the case to me on December 5, 2008, and issued a \nNotice of Hearing on January 7, 2009. The case was heard on January 28, 2009 as \nscheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, called one character witness and offered exhibits \n(AE) A through D into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left \nthe record open until February 13, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional information. On February 12, 2009, Applicant submitted an exhibit that I \nmarked as AE E and admitted into the record without objection from the Government. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 6, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the SOR.1  \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and married. He has four adult children. He earned a \nBachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1974 and has worked for a federal \ncontractor for the past 35 years.

From \nSeptember 1997 to May 2000, he lived in Georgia. He returned to California in June \n2000 and lived there until September 2001.

As of May 11, 2008, \n$9,975 remains to be paid and you have yet to file a return for 2001.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant did not reside in California in 1993. He filed his 1994 return on April 17, \n1995, the 1995 return on April 15, 1996, the 1996 return on April 15, 1997, and the 1997 \nreturn on April 15, 1998. He did not reside in California in 1998 or 1999. He filed a part-\ntime resident 2000 return on August 15, 2001. He filed his 2001 return on August 16, \n2007, six years late. He failed to file it timely for several reasons. Due to geographic \ntransfers in his employment in 2000 and 2001, he bought and sold two homes and used \nmonies from his 401(k), along with a large transfer bonus for one of the purchases. His \nemployer changed the payroll deduction system around this time, generating multiple \n                                            \n1The SOR incorrectly numbered the second paragraph as Paragraph 3, and not as Paragraph 2.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nW-2 forms, some of which contained errors that had to be corrected.2 In addition to the \ncomplications with the W-2 forms and additional taxes owed because of a bonus and \n401(k) withdrawal, he had difficulty calculating his taxes and gathering the information. \nAfter filing the 2001 return in 2007, he received a tax bill for $4,500 that he paid in July \n2008. He subsequently received another notification from California that he owed an \nadditional $1,500 that he paid in January 2009. The 2008 tax lien was released on \nJanuary 8, 2009. All matters are resolved. He admitted that he should have sought help \nwith the 2001 complicated return and filed it much sooner. (Tr. 39-49; AE C) \n \n \n \nParagraph 1(b) of the SOR alleged: \u201cYou failed to file your federal tax returns for \nyears 1993 through 1999. As a result the IRS filed a lien against you in the approximate \namount of $5,706, which was satisfied and released in 2004, only after the IRS applied \nyour tax refunds from years 2000 to 2003 as an offset.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant filed his 1993 federal return on February 14, 2994, his 1994 return on \nApril 17, 1995, the 1995 return on April 15, 1996, the 1996 return on April 15, 1997, the \n1997 return on April 15, 1998, and the 1998 return on April 15, 1999. (AE A) All of these \nwere timely filed. (Tr. 50-54; AE D; Response: Attachment 3) Department Counsel \nacknowledged that the allegations filed under Paragraph 1(b) were incorrectly alleged \nas the returns were filed well before the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 54; 95) \n \n \nParagraph 1(c) of the SOR alleged: \u201cYou failed to file your personal income tax \nreturn with the State of Georgia for tax years 1987 through 1992.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant filed his 1987 Georgia return on November 15, 1991, and his 1988 and \n1989 returns on June 20, 1999. All three of these were late. He was entitled to receive \nrefunds for each of those years, but did not because of the late filings. He admitted the \nlate filings, and attributed the delay to moving during that period, his daughter\u2019s illness, \nfinancial over-extension, potential foreclosure problems, all of which resulted in tax \nliabilities that he could not pay.3 In addition, he had not timely filed his federal taxes for \nthe years 1987, 1988 and 1989, further exacerbating the situation.4 Because he \nanticipated receiving a refund from the state for those years, he procrastinated. He \nacknowledges his error. He timely filed his 1990, 1991 and 1992 state returns. (AE D; \nResponse: Attachment 4)  All matters relating to the tax returns for these six years are \nresolved.  (Tr. 54-62) \n \n \nParagraph 1(d) of the SOR alleged: \u201cYou failed to file your federal tax returns \nwith the I.R.S. for tax years 2005 and 2006, owing approximately $6,577 including \ninterest and penalties. As of March 8, 2008 this debt has not bene [sic] paid.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2005 federal return on April 16, 2006. He paid $7,575 on July \n15, 2006, and made an additional payment of $274 in May 2007. This year is resolved. \n                                            \n2Applicant noted these problems in his January 2000 Statement of Subject. (GE 6)  \n3Applicant noted these problems in his January 1997 Statement of Subject. (GE 3)  \n4He filed his federal 1987, 1988 and 1989 tax returns in November 1991.   \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nHe filed his 2006 federal return on August 14, 2007, after receiving an extension. He \nmade the $6,566 final payment on the taxes on August 1, 2008. This year is resolved. \n(Response: Attachment 5; Tr. 63-66)  \n \n \nApplicant timely filed his 2007 state and federal returns. He later received a \n$2,000 refund from the state. On January 14, 2009, the IRS notified him that he had an \noutstanding tax liability of $2,113 on his 2007 taxes. He admitted that he should have \nsought help with the complicated return. In accordance with an installment payment \nplan he negotiated with the IRS, he mailed a $500 check to the government on January \n28, 2009, reducing that tax balance to about $1,650.5 \n \n \nFrom 1987 until 2007, Applicant was required to file yearly state and federal tax \nreturns for a total of 40 returns.  All of those returns were timely filed, except eight \nreturns: his 1987, 1988 and 1989 federal tax returns were filed in November 1991; his \n2001 federal return was filed in November 2003; his 1987 Georgia return was filed in \nNovember 1991; his 1988 and 1989 Georgia returns were filed in June 1999; and his \n2001 California return was filed in August 2007. All state and federal taxes owed for \nthose twenty years are resolved. (AE E) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he previously had problems filing his returns on time and \nowing sizeable amounts of money to the Government at tax time. In order to correct that \nproblem and prevent its recurrence, he has increased the amount of money withheld \nfrom his paycheck by an additional $7,200 annually. (Tr. 70-72; 86; AE E) That \nadditional withholding should cover any tax shortage at the end of future tax years. (Tr. \n87-88)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $8,170. (AE E). His expenses are about \n$8,040, including payments on two mortgages, a car loan, and six credit cards, leaving \nabout $130 per month, according to his August 2007 budget. (Response: Attachment 3) \nThe budget does not contain the $500 monthly installment payment for his 2008 tax \nliability, which will be paid in three months. However, it appears that he is able to pay \nthat based on the payments he made in December 2008 and January 2009. He and his \nwife have a budget established for the next three years that will track their expenses, \nspending, and promote savings. (Tr. 91-92)                                                                                             \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s immediate supervisor testified. He currently supervises about 150 \npeople and a $400 billion program. He has held a Secret clearance for 24 years.  He \nhas known Applicant for seven years and is aware of his tax issues. He has \u201cfound \n[Applicant] to be a dependable, reliable, trustworthy, a morally and ethically sound who \npossess impeccable character and integrity.\u201d (Tr. 27) He has no reservation in \nrecommending him for a security clearance. (Tr. 27)  \n \n \nApplicant presented his case in a very organized and detailed manner. He spent \na great deal of time gathering documents since the SOR was issued, and he appears to \n                                            \n5 The SOR does not contain any allegations pertaining to 2007. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nhave a comprehensive understanding of the situation, as well as his finances. He \nrealizes the importance of complying with tax filing requirements and monitoring his \nwithholding monies. Throughout his testimony, he was candid, remorseful and \nembarrassed by this situation. (Tr. 93-94)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and maybe be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or \nthe fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for the years 1987, 1988, \n1989, and 2001. He also failed to timely file state returns for 1987, 1988, 1989, and \n2001. The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant filed a state 2001 tax return in \nAugust 2007, which is too recent to trigger the application of this condition, given his \nprevious history of late filings.  Although there were certain circumstances that arose in \nthe late 1980\u2019s and again in 2000 to 2001, which complicated his tax situation, none of \nthem justified the late filings. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. He presented evidence \nindicating that he is addressing the situation and that there are \u201cclear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). \nHe has also paid all previously owed taxes, such that AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable. The \nrecord evidence does not support the application of  AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 20(f). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and maybe \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government of other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \nBased on the evidence, Applicant\u2019s failure to file state and federal tax returns in \n1987, 1988, 1989, and 2001 demonstrate a pattern of poor judgment and rule violations, \nsufficient to raise the above disqualification.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes a condition that could mitigate the disqualification raised in \nthis case: \n \n (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant acknowledged his behavior and is remorseful. He has increased \nthe amount of his monthly withholding taxes, in order to prevent a similar problem \nfrom arising in the future. He and his wife have also established a long-range \nbudget that will help them maintain financial responsibility and avoid additional \nlate tax filing problems. The above mitigating condition is applicable to his \nprevious pattern of failure to timely file tax returns.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 56-year-old man, who \nhas a 35-year successful work history with his employer. He began experiencing \npersonal and financial difficulties from 1987 through 1989, and again in 2000 and 2001, \nattributable to family issues, financial over-extension, and geographical transfers. From \n1987 to 2007, he filed eight tax returns significantly late. He filed the other 32 tax \nreturns, required during that period, within the legal time limits.  He understands the \nunderlying reasons for the late filings and takes full responsibility for his actions. He \nadmitted that he should have sought help with the complicated returns, and I suspect he \nwill in the future, if necessary. With his new budget, he should be able to avoid similar \npayment problems, given the amount of money he earns. He was a candid and credible \nwitness. His supervisor is aware of the issues and continues to strongly support him. \nThere is minimal potential for exploitation or likelihood of a recurrence.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations and \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:6  \n \n  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM, Administrative Judge \n                                            \n6 This Paragraph should have been numbered \u201c2\u201d and not \u201c3.\u201d \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated October 23, 2007, Applicant denied being indebted to the four creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, with explanations. During the hearing, however, he admitted that he was jointly liable for each of the debts, and had not paid any of them. (Tr. at 66 to 74.) In the Answer, he admitted owing his mother $1,000 from an informal loan in the original amount of $2,000, and that his retirement pay is being garnished for child support payments to his ex-wife, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are incorporated in the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 42-year-old ordnance mechanic who performed similar work on active duty in the Navy for 22 years. He and his wife have a 3-year-old child. He has three older children who live with his former wife. He is a high school graduate. He successfully held a Secret security clearance throughout most of his naval service, most recently based on an investigation completed on March 3, 1989. Applicant and his former wife underwent a bitter separation from August 2001 until their divorce was final in May 2003. During that period of time, Applicant incurred the expense of living separately, while also providing his wife and children $1,500 per month in support while they occupied Government housing. Also during that period, his wife incurred over $17,000 in credit card debt on two accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) for which she was the primary card holde",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s former wife incurred substantial delinquent joint debt during their\nseparation preceding their 2003 divorce. Applicant has been unable to repay all of these\ndebts. He has not incurred any additional delinquent debt. He and his current wife paid\noff as much as they could, and have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief to discharge\nthe balance. Based upon thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on\nOctober 30, 2006, while he was on active duty in the Navy. He transferred to the Fleet\nReserve and began drawing retirement pay on May 1, 2007. While on terminal leave, he\nbegan working for his current employer on a defense contract. On September 28, 2007,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD)\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 23, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 25, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 18, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 25, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 21, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A (a bound volume with multiple tabs and\nexhibits), which was admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until March 10, 2008, to submit additional matters. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 29, 2008. While the record remained open,\nApplicant submitted seven documents via Department Counsel, who forwarded them to\nme without objection on March 10, 2008. These documents were collectively marked\nAE B, and the record was closed. On April 15, 2008, I requested Department Counsel to\naccess the JPAS database to determine the accuracy of Applicant\u2019s understanding that\nthe Navy had granted him a final Secret clearance in early 2007. Department Counsel\nprovided Applicant and me a copy of Applicant\u2019s Navy and contractor \u201cPerson\nSummary\u201d pages on April 16, 2007. I reopened the record and included these\ndocuments as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.\nProcedural Issue\nAs noted above, Applicant believed that the Navy had approved a final Secret\nclearance for him sometime in early 2007, based on the investigation resulting from his\nOctober 2006 SF 86. (See AE A, Security Clearance History section at 2; Tr. at 34-37.)\nIf this were true, that determination could be binding on DOHA under Sections 2.4 and\n3.3(d) of Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 2, 1995),\nespecially since all the potentially negative information alleged in the present SOR was\nderived from that SF 86 and investigation. These sections require reciprocal acceptance\nof access eligibility determinations, and reapproval of eligible recently retired or\notherwise separated U.S. Government employees under most circumstances. \nApplicant did not produce documentary evidence that he was granted a final\nsecurity clearance in 2007, but testified that the security manager at his last command\ninformed him that his final clearance had been approved. He also had no access to\nGovernment records on the matter. Department Counsel provided HE I to clarify the\nsituation. These documents show that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigation resulting from Applicant\u2019s October 2006 SF 86 was opened on November\n27, 2006, and closed, pending adjudication, on May 16, 2007. They also show,\nconsistent with his DD 214 discharge certificate (GE 3 at 11.), that he was separated\n\n3\nfrom active duty on April 30, 2007. His most recent clearance eligibility determination\nwas made on June 15, 1992, based on an investigation completed on March 3, 1989.\n(HE I at 2.) Accordingly, Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information\nbased on the aforementioned reciprocity provisions of the Executive Order.  \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 23, 2007, Applicant denied being\nindebted to the four creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, with explanations. During\nthe hearing, however, he admitted that he was jointly liable for each of the debts, and\nhad not paid any of them. (Tr. at 66 to 74.) In the Answer, he admitted owing his mother\n$1,000 from an informal loan in the original amount of $2,000, and that his retirement\npay is being garnished for child support payments to his ex-wife, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.e and 1.f. Applicant\u2019s admissions and explanations are incorporated in the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old ordnance mechanic who performed similar work on\nactive duty in the Navy for 22 years. He and his wife have a 3-year-old child. He has\nthree older children who live with his former wife. He is a high school graduate. He\nsuccessfully held a Secret security clearance throughout most of his naval service, most\nrecently based on an investigation completed on March 3, 1989.  \nApplicant and his former wife underwent a bitter separation from August 2001\nuntil their divorce was final in May 2003. During that period of time, Applicant incurred\nthe expense of living separately, while also providing his wife and children $1,500 per\nmonth in support while they occupied Government housing. Also during that period, his\nwife incurred over $17,000 in credit card debt on two accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) for\nwhich she was the primary card holder and Applicant was jointly liable as an authorized\nuser. Applicant\u2019s 21 monthly support payments during that time were $300 more that\notherwise required with the understanding that his wife would keep their bill payments\ncurrent using those funds. Despite his contributions, and her substantial income as a\nnurse, she did not do so. These accounts became delinquent in November 2001 and\nFebruary 2002, respectively, with the total amount due having grown to the SOR-\nalleged $21,154, by the time they were charged-off. (GE 2 at 10, 8.) \nThe delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a resulted from his wife\u2019s purchase of a\ncomputer on credit in March 2001. She kept the computer, but stopped making\npayments on the loan in March 2002, with an outstanding balance of $1,053. All record\ncredit bureau reports (CBRs) reflect a zero balance due on this as a charged off\naccount. Under their divorce decree, she retained possession of the computer and\nagreed to pay the remaining loan balance, together with half of their other joint debt, but\nshe never did. Instead, she declared bankruptcy and was discharged under Chapter 7,\nleaving Applicant solely responsible for all their joint debt. The $844 debt alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b was for medical laboratory work that she requested be done in December\n2002 on one of their children\u2019s blood, without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, despite the fact\nthat the procedure was not covered by his military medical insurance. This debt was\n\n4\ndisputed by Applicant, and does not appear on his recent CBRs (GE 4 at 33; GE 5; GE\n6.)  Applicant did resolve one other joint $7,985 credit card debt in October 2004. (AE A\nat Exhibit D.) No other delinquent accounts are reflected on Applicant\u2019s CBRs.\nApplicant and his wife incurred significant expenses in connection with moving\noverseas on military orders in April 2005, and moving back to the United States as a\nresult of medical problems in August 2006. They incurred further expenses moving from\ntheir last Navy duty station to their present location, and to attend several family\nfunerals. Despite these expenses, they have remained current on all their bills.\nHowever, they have not been able to pay down the old delinquent debt. Due to the\nmoving and medical expenses for which they were not reimbursed, they borrowed\n$2,000 from Applicant\u2019s mother and $1,500 from his wife\u2019s step-mother. They repaid the\nlatter loan in full on June 1, 2007. They also repaid half of the loan from his mother on\nthat date. They are repaying the balance, in spite of  her willingness to extend the loan,\nat a rate of $50 per month. (GE 4 at 6, 45; AE A at Exhibit G; Tr. at 46-47, 74.)\nApplicant\u2019s former wife filed a petition with DFAS for child support garnishment of\nhis retired pay despite the fact that he was making regular payments to her by direct\ndeposit. Because this resulted in substantial overpayment, the court reduced his\nmonthly obligation to restore the balance. Applicant was advised to, and did, keep the\ngarnishment in effect to provide documentation of the payments. Limitations on\ngarnishment actions result in monthly garnishments in the $800 range, and he sends a\nmonthly check to her for the difference between the garnished amount and the $1,000\ntotal that he provides. He was never delinquent in his child support payments.\nApplicant and his wife have attended several financial counseling and budget\nplanning sessions, through the Navy Fleet and Family Service Center, the Navy-Marine\nCorps Relief Society, and in connection with their bankruptcy filing. They have retained\nan attorney, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief on March 3, 2008. (AE A at \u201cDebt\nRelief Plan of Action\u201d tab; AE B.) They are closely monitoring their expenses to avoid\nincurring further debt. Applicant\u2019s wife has also applied for two cashier positions, and is\nlikely to be hired soon to further supplement their income.\nApplicant was advised by Navy officials during his final years in the service that\ndeclaring bankruptcy to resolve the delinquent debts arising from his divorce would\ncause him to lose his security clearance. Accordingly, he did not do so. When he\nreceived his SOR, putting his clearance at risk, and could not repay the major debts in\nquestion, he again sought legal advice. A Navy legal assistance attorney, after\nconsulting with base security officials, advised Applicant that a bankruptcy would not\nnecessarily preclude eligibility for a clearance. Accordingly, they chose to file the\npresent bankruptcy action to finally resolve those debts in a legal manner.  \nApplicant provided a substantial number of character references from former\nmilitary supervisors and colleagues, and family members, all attesting to his\nresponsibility, trustworthiness, and dedication to a lifetime in service of the national\ndefense. He also presented an extensive character reference from a Ph.D. Psychologist\n\n5\nand ethicist, for whom he did substantial work after hours between 2001 and 2007. She\nconcluded her three-page letter explaining her very high opinion of him as follows: \nIn summary, [Applicant] has shown himself to be one of the most\nhonorable, trustworthy, dedicated men I have had the privilege of knowing.\nHe has consistently demonstrated a strong sense of personal duty and\nresponsibility, of doing what is right and being fair. He shows maturity in\nhow seriously he takes his obligations to himself, those he loves and to his\ncountry.\n(AE A, \u201cCharacter References\u201d tab, at 13.) His Navy performance evaluations also\nreflect steady and strong performance with no disciplinary problems.       \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n6\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 123.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d I\nconcur that the evidence does not establish any of the other disqualifying conditions. \nThe evidence shows that Applicant has paid all of his financial obligations in a\ntimely manner except the four debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, and the other\nformerly delinquent credit card account he resolved in 2004. He and his wife have been\nand are unable to pay the roughly $23,000 outstanding on those debts. Security\nconcerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), but the concerns are not as\nsignificant as would be the case if these debts arose from irresponsible behavior or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Neither the garnishment of his pay nor\nthe loan from  his mother create any security concerns, since the former merely\nreplaced part of his otherwise up-to-date support payments, and the latter is being\nrepaid ahead of schedule. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is not indicative of poor self-\ncontrol or lack of judgment on his part under the circumstances, in that it was both\ngenerated and defaulted on by his former wife, then attributed to him by the creditors. \n\n7\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Four pertinent\nconditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts all arose as a result of his joint liability for debts\nincurred and not paid by his former wife during their marital problems and separation\nleading to their 2003 divorce. She subsequently filed for bankruptcy, discharging her\njoint liability for them. He and his current wife were able to resolve one delinquency in\n2004, but due to frequent moves and medical problems, have been unable to pay the\nothers.\nApplicant\u2019s current marriage is strong, and his wife will soon be returning to work\nafter a period of staying home to raise their three-year-old. They have managed to avoid\nany further delinquent debt, and have carefully budgeted their income with the\nassistance of several financial counselors to maintain solvency. After being advised,\ncontrary to earlier guidance, that bankruptcy is a lawful method of resolving debt and\nnot per se disqualifying for ongoing security clearance purposes, they have filed for\nChapter 7 relief of unsecured debt, including the four SOR-listed delinquencies. \nThis evidence establishes substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c) and\n(d) for the relatively minor security concerns raised by the continuing existence of these\ndebts at the time of the hearing. Combined with his demonstrated integrity and good\ncharacter, discharging this debt in bankruptcy will eliminate any risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds to meet them. The absence of any such conduct during\nthe six-year existence of the delinquencies is further evidence that Applicant would not\nsuccumb to such temptation in any event. Family members and others who know him\nwell uniformly described his good character, responsible conduct, and dedication to\nhonorably serving in the defense and security of the United States, even while doing\nwhat he could to address the financial issues listed  in the SOR.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves delinquent debts that were incurred largely due to circumstances\nbeyond his control as his former marriage broke apart. He has incurred no new\ndelinquent debt, and lives frugally. The amount of delinquent debt is more than he can\nrepay, but ongoing bankruptcy proceedings will discharge those debts. Applicant is a\nmature, experienced technician in a good paying job, and his wife is returning to work\nas well. There is no ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\nsince his financial situation is known to his family, his employer, and the Government,\nand is on track for full resolution. His substantial and responsible steps to resolve the\ndebts and maintain present solvency make continuation or recurrence quite unlikely.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts and history\nof not meeting financial obligations. He established his integrity, good character, and\nability to protect classified information. \u201cAn applicant is not required to show that [he]\nhas completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a reasonable\nplan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d\nISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-\n09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). Overall, the record evidence leaves neither\nquestions nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Phillip D. Cave, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on December 6,\n2005. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on November 13, 2007, and\nrequested a decision in his case be made administratively (on the record of documents\npresented). On February 28, 2008, he changed his position by deciding that he wanted\na hearing. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 22, 2008 for a hearing on May 30,\n2008. The hearing was postponed, and the case file was transferred to the undersigned\non July 10, 2008 because of caseload considerations. \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n2\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 28, 2008 and the hearing was held on\nAugust 12, 2008. At the hearing, eight exhibits (GE I through 8) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government's case. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted seventeen exhibits. (AE A-AE Q) In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish\nadditional documentation, he submitted AE R1 through R98. The additional\ndocumentation relates to pending litigation he has with another company, official\ndocuments related to formation of his company (Company C) in 1995, and dissolution\ndocuments of that company. There is a dispute letter addressed to the creditor in SOR\n1.d. dated August 11, 2008, and a request for a title check dated August 15, 2008 in\nconnection with the past due account set forth in SOR 1.e. DOHA received a copy of\nthe transcript of the proceedings on August 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR has 10 allegations under the financial considerations guideline, totaling\nabout $83,000.00. Most of the debts became delinquent in 2004 and 2005 (GE 4, 5, 6).\nIn his answer, he has admitted four of the accounts. In response to SOR 1.b., he stated\nhe was settling the account. He also admitted he owed the accounts identified in SOR\n1.f., 1.g., and 1.j. He denied the remaining accounts, asserting they were corporate\naccounts belonging to his company, Company C (AE R21).\nApplicant retired from the United States (U.S.) Coast Guard receiving an\nHonorable Discharge in June 1977. He has been married to his second wife since\nDecember. 2003. They have a 21-year-old-disabled child. Applicant's wife, a nurse,\nremains at home providing care for the child. Applicant has been working for his current\nemployer as a business development director since October 2005. Since September\n2007, he has been in layoff status. He seeks a security clearance.\nIn 1985, Applicant developed a remote control surveillance boat that he wanted\nto market to the United States (U.S.) military agencies. In 1988, Applicant formed\nCompany A. The purpose of the company was to develop the boat for sale to the U.S.\ngovernment. Applicant also established two patents. In 1989, Company A sold its first\nboat to the U.S. Navy (Tr. 29). In 1992, Company A was sold to Company B, a foreign\nbusiness, and Applicant was designated managing director of the company. Company B\nthen went bankrupt, and Applicant formed Company C in 1995 (Tr. 31), appointing\nhimself president to continue to obtain contracts for his unmanned boat. Company C\nexecuted more than 41 contracts between 1995 and 2000 (Tr. 33).\nSome time in 2000, Company C experienced a severe reduction in business,\nbeginning with a 15-ship contract cancellation by a Middle Eastern customer (Tr. 36)\nAlso, another element of the Navy was developing the same kind of unmanned boat\nthat Applicant believed was a copy of his technology (Id.).\n\n3\nTo keep his failing business functioning, Company C sold a boat to Company D.\nTo increase their business, Company C sought overseas contracts, and found\ncontinuing interest in their boat from the Middle Eastern countries.\nOther adverse events impacted Applicant's business (Company C) In early 2002,\nhe filed for marital dissolution; the marriage was dissolved on June 26, 2002, and\nApplicant was ordered to repay a $19,000.00 loan to his first wife. In June 2002,\nCompany C lost a big contract from a country in the Far East. Third, in the same month\nApplicant had a heart attack, and spent 1 \u00bd weeks in intensive care (Tr. 49).\nBecause of Applicant's health, coupled with his company\u2019s loss of its contracts,\nand the stress generated from his competition in the U.S. Navy for boat contracts,\nApplicant decided to close Company C (AE R21). Company C\u2019s business actually\nclosed down in September, October and November 2002, At the time, Applicant asserts\nhe was trying to pay off some of Company C\u2019s corporate debts. Applicant noted that\ncompany credit cards were a major reason Company C was able to continue business;\nthese cards were in Company C's name, with Applicant's signature appearing on bills as\nCompany C's president (Tr. 54).\nIn May 2003, Applicant started working for Company E as a business developer,\nand they asked him to enter a partnership to market his boat technology (Tr. 57-59). In\nDecember 2003, Company F purchased Company E, and signed a contract with a\ncountry in the Middle East to sell Applicant's boat. As a part of this contract, Company F\nentered into an agreement to pay Applicant $750,000 for his boat technology; they did\npay him $50,000.00, but he never received the balance (Tr. 68). Applicant is seeking in\nlitigation about $517,000.00 from Company F, which constitutes the balance owed him,\nminus certain expenses (AE R9).\nIn March 2004, Company F purchased Applicant's product line in defunct\nCompany C, and also took control of the company's records. Applicant asserts that\nincluded among those records are the documents verifying that Company C, not\nApplicant, was liable for the credit card debt (answer to SOR).\nThe ten debts shall be discussed in the order they appear in the SOR. The total\namount of indebtedness is approximately $83,000.00.\nSOR l.a., Judgment, $8,892.00. Applicant has no idea how the judgment came in\nexistence. He filed a response to the judgment on May 31, 2007. (Tr. 120; AE Q) The\ncourt entered a final judgment against Applicant on November 30, 2007 (GE 7, 8).\nApplicant still owes this debt.\nSOR 1.b. medical debt, $221.00. AE M indicates this debt became delinquent in\n2005, with a balance of $221.00 as of March 2008. Applicant admitted the debt in his\nanswer to the SOR, but stated at the hearing he was disputing the debt (Tr. 80).\nApplicant was asked why his testimony contradicted his answer to the SOR. Before\nultimately stating he was not disputing his answer, Applicant initially explained that he\n\n4\nwas laid off his job in September 2007, and had been paying much closer attention to\nhis expenditures (Tr. 125). I find Applicant still owes this debt.\nSOR 1.c. Credit Card debt. $2,486.00. Applicant explained this was a corporate\ncredit card with his current employer. The amount represented expenses for attending a\ntrade show (Tr. 129). He made a payment on the debt in March 2007 (GE 2), and paid\nthe card off in August or September 2007 (AE M). I find for Applicant.\nSOR 1.d. Credit card account, $10,400.00. According to AE M, the account was\ndeleted from Applicant's credit report. I find for Applicant under this allegation.\nSOR i.e. Bank debt for mobile home. Applicant contends it was a business debt,\nbut supplied no documentation in support. Applicant officially disputed the debt in May\n2006. He executed a record check on August 15, 2008, requesting a title history for a\nvehicle (AE R94). I find for Applicant under this allegation.\nSOR 1.f. Credit card, $10,503.00. This account was deleted from Applicant's\ncredit report (AE K). I find for Applicant.\nSOR 1.g. Tire account, 2,081.00. In his answer, he admitted he owed this\naccount. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the account was taken off his credit report.\n(Tr. 81) Later in his testimony, he accepted responsibility for the debt because he had\nno documents to show otherwise(Tr. 136). I find Applicant owes this debt.\nSOR l.h. Credit card, $13,988.00. Applicant believed the debt could be a\nduplicate of SOR i.d., a debt that was deleted from Applicant's credit report (AE M). I\nfind for Applicant.\nSOR 1.i. Credit card, $17,370.00. Applicant claimed this was a business debt of\nCompany C. However, he provided no evidence of whether the debt was deleted from\nhis credit report, or that the debt is no longer being reported. I find against Applicant. I\nfind Applicant owes this debt. \nSOR 1.j. Cellular phone account. $622.00. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted he owed the account and was working to have the debt resolved through an\noffered settlement. At the hearing, he was disputing the debt (Tr. 85). The overdue\naccount was verified in AE K. I find Applicant still owes the debt.\nCharacter Evidence\nMr. A1, along with five other individuals, provided a written character statement in\nwhich he lauded his relationship with Applicant based on working with him in\ngovernment contracts related to Applicant's boat technology. Based on Applicant's\nprofessionalism, Mr. A1 recommends him for position of trust with the government. Mr.\nB1 has known Applicant for two years, and considers him truthful.\n\n5\nMr. C1 wrote that he worked with Applicant closely from 1994 to 1998 when\nApplicant was president of Company C. According to Mr. C1, Applicant has always\ndemonstrated fairness and honesty. Mr. D1 worked with Applicant from 1992 to 2000,\nwhen Applicant was president of first Company A and then Company C., and Mr. D1\nwas a government program manager from 1992 to 2000. Mr. D1 considers Applicant\ndependable and recommends him for a position of trust.\nMr. E1 knew Applicant professionally from 1991 to 1993, then again in 2005,\nwhen their professional careers brought them together. While admiring Applicant\nassume difficult stands with his employer at the time, Mr. E1 never explained what\nthose positions were. Mr. E1 concluded by stating Applicant is trustworthy. Mr. F1 met\nApplicant in the late i980s, and was impressed with his boat technology. With Mr. Fl's\nrecommendation in hand, Applicant's current employer hired him. Based on his frequent\ncontact with Applicant, Mr. F1 recommends him for a position of trust.\nHaving weighed and balanced the entire record, particularly Applicant's testimony\ndisputing past due debts that he admitted in his answer to the SOR, I find Applicant's\noverall credibility weakened by the conflicting testimony in those areas. Applicant's\nunemployment situation does not supply a reasonable excuse for not providing candid\nanswers about his debts. Applicant still owes the debts identified in SOR l.a., 1.b., l.g.,\n1.i., and l.j. totaling $29,186.00. I find for Applicant under SOR 1.c., l.d., I.e., 1.f., and\nl.h.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18.\nThe Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) I9.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC 1 9.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) are applicable to this\ncase. Applicant incurred most of the overdue debt in 2004 and 2005 (GE 4, 5, 6), and\nstill owes more than $29,000.00.\nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). This condition provides some\nmitigation) because most of the debts became delinquent more than four years ago.\nHowever, Applicant's lack of candor about several of the debts, i.e., disputing SOR 1.b.\ndebt after admitting he owes the debt and receiving documented verification) casts\ndoubt on his reliability and trustworthiness, notwithstanding his glowing character\nevidence complimenting his good judgment and honesty for the last 20 years.\n\n7\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\nmay apply in those circumstances where events outside the person's control contributed\nto the financial difficulty. Applicant's divorce, health condition, competition, loss of\nbusiness, and current unemployment, have been thoroughly evaluated. The record\nshows that his marital dissolution occurred in June 2002. Applicant's health condition\nimproved to a level where he resumed working in May 2003. Applicant did not\ndemonstrate responsible action regarding the unpaid debts until May 2006, when he\nrequested certain debts be removed from his credit report. However, the only debt in the\nSOR he paid was SOR 1.c. debt, and the payoff did not occur until the debt had gone to\ncollection (AE M). When he received documentation he owed the SOR l.b. debt, he\nchanged his position by disputing it rather than, to simply state at the hearing that he did\nnot pay the debt because he was unemployed, and did not have the money. On\nbalance, the limited mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.a. and 20.b. is\ninsufficient to overcome his financial indebtedness.\nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\nFC MC 20.d. and (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) shall be addressed together because there is no evidence of\nfinancial counseling, and no evidence the outstanding delinquent debts in SOR l.a., l.b. ,\nl.g., 1.i., and 1.j. have been paid, or that they are debts of Company C. There has been\nno action to pay the debts.\nFC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue) applies in those situations where an applicant has a reasonable\ndispute, and has provided documented proof to substantiate the basis for the dispute.\nApplicant provided documentation in May 2007 denying that SOR l.a. debt is his\nresponsibility. The court reviewed his documentation but rejected it in their final\njudgment in November 2007. The documentation shows there is no basis for Applicant's\ndispute of SOR 1.b. Applicant has no reasonable basis to dispute the tire account in\nSOR l.g., particularly after he admitted the account was his. The absence of\ndocumentation provides little basis for Applicant's contention that SOR 1.i. account is\nnot his account. Applicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that the cellular phone\naccount (SOR l.j.) was his responsibility, yet disputed the account at the hearing.\nOverall, Applicant's evidence is insufficient to meet his burden of persuasion under the\nfinancial considerations guideline.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the Fl guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigation conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the case, and the whole person concept. Applicant\nis 56 years old. His professional accomplishments appear in the documentation. I have\nreviewed the unanticipated events that occurred in his life to cause or exacerbate his\nfinancial problems. Applicant incorporated a company to manufacture and sell his\nunmanned surveillance boat. A series of events emerged at the same time in 2002 that\nforced him to dissolve his company at the end of 2002. At least four years have passed\nsince Company C closed. I have found that certain accounts identified in SOR 1.d., i.e.,\nl.f., and l.h. were business debts that he is not responsible for. I found that he paid the\nSOR l.c. account in 2007. These debts were found in his favor based on documentation\nhe provided that showed the debts were deleted or paid. On the other hand, the\naccounts in SOR l.a., l.b., l.g., l.i., and l.j. are resolved against him due to the lack of\ndocumentation to support his claim they were not his debts or were business debts.\nThose debts total about $29,000.00. With respect to l.b., I.g., and l.i., Applicant's\nconflicting positions regarding his responsibility for these debts undercut his credibility,\nand generate ongoing concerns for a continuation of financial troubles in the future. \nOverall, I have carefully evaluated the respect Applicant's colleagues have\ndemonstrated for him in the past 20 years. This favorable character evidence is\ncreditable, but insufficient to surmount the security concerns engendered by his\ncontinuing financial delinquencies. Having considered the entire record and all the\nexhibits, Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the financial\nconsiderations guideline.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Per Se\n______________\n       Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn November 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to  Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III\nposition, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\ntrustworthiness determination clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 21, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 15, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 22, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 22, 2008, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s application for a public trust position.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on three\nMay 22, 2008\n\n2\nwitnesses (including herself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on\nMarch 3, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility to access a public trust position is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her payments of several of her medical and consumer\ncreditors, and efforts to document a likely favorable judgment covering creditor 1.c and\ncontact with creditor 1.b.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted three weeks, to\nMarch 17, 2008, to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with documented copies of her cover letter to Department\nCounsel, her favorable judgment with creditor 1.c, her checking additions and\nsubtractions covering a 2002 account transaction involving creditor 1.b, and a recent\nearnings statement.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in 1993, and was discharged in 1994 and (b) accumulated two delinquent or\ncharged off debts exceeding $23,000.00.  \nFor her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted her 1993 bankruptcy petition and\ndischarge in 1994.  She admitted her two listed debts with creditors 1.b and 1.c,\nrespectively, but denied the amounts owed.  Applicant provided explanations\nconcerning her loss of employment that precipitated her 1993 bankruptcy, and her\nsubsequent loss of employment in 2002 and ensuing downturn in her home-based\nbusiness, and denial of unemployment benefits that deprived her of any income for a\n14-month period before her return to full time employment in June 2003.  Applicant\nclaimed unsuccessful credit counseling and more recent working with an attorney to\nresolve her remaining two outstanding debts. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior customer service representative for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a trustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the\nSOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and\nmaterial findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is currently divorced and has no children.  She received two\nAssociated Arts degrees and intends to pursue her bachelors degree as well (R.T., at\n66-67).\n   \nFollowing her divorce and loss of employment due to a county reduction in force\nin State 1 in the early 90s, Applicant went through a difficult financial period during\nwhich she time she was unable to meet all of her financial obligations (R.T., at 47, 70-\n\n3\n71).  Pressed to her limits, she petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 1993.  In\nher Chapter 7 petition, she scheduled $61,466.00 in secured claims and $9,114.00 in\nunsecured claims (R.T., at 72).  Applicant was discharged in bankruptcy in January\n1994.  \nIn April 2002, Applicant resigned her State 2 job over an Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) dispute, and embarked on a home-based business of\nher own.  Because of the circumstances in which she resigned her State 1 county job,\nshe was not eligible for unemployment benefits (R.T., at 81).  She worked temporarily in\nvarious capacities for a number of months before embarking on a home-based business\nin State 1 (see ex. 1).   With too little resources to pursue her EEOC complaint in court,\nshe dropped her claims. \nUnable to generate any profit from her home-based business or find full time\nemployment in State 1, Applicant essentially had no income for approximately 14\nmonths.  To make ends meet, she was forced to invade her retirement fund, use her\nsavings, and exercise her stock options.  Still, she did not have enough income to make\nends meet and fell behind in her financial obligations.  By April 2003 she had exhausted\nmost of her retirement, savings and stock options, and could no longer fund her creditor\n1.b and 1.c debts (R.T., at 78).  Facing financial hardship, she telephoned her creditors\nto enlist their assistance (R.T., at 76-78). \nIn June 2003, Applicant found employment in State 2 as a system administrator.\nOnce employed and relocated to State 2, she began contacting her old creditors to\nexplore repayment arrangements (R.T., at 75-76).  She was able to make a verbal\npayment arrangement with creditor 1.c and began making monthly payments of $392.16\n(see ex. 2; R.T., at 59, 75-78).  She was laid off by her State 2 employer in June 2004,\nhowever, and accepted a position with her current employer the same month (see ex. 1;\nR.T., at 67, 76).  While transitioning to her new assignment in State 3, she briefly\nsuspended her creditor 1.c payments (R.T., at 76). \nOnce relocated to State 3, Applicant wrote to creditor 1.c\u2019s collection agent and\nadvised the agent that she would be resuming her monthly payments as soon as she\nwas settled in her new location (R.T., at 59-60).  The following month (in July 2004), she\nsought counseling from Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) to explore debt\nconsolidation (see ex. C; R.T., at 64-66).  CCCS developed a budget for her and\nrecommended she work with the individual creditors herself (see ex. C; R.T., at 64-65).\nIn the meantime, Applicant never received any written response from her June 2004\nletter to creditor 1.c, and never received any correspondence identifying the creditor\u2019s\nagent and its payment demands.  \nMonths after writing to creditor 1.c, Applicant began receiving harassing phone\ncalls from the creditor\u2019s agent.  In March 2007, creditor 1.c served Applicant with court\npapers demanding payment of the creditor\u2019s entire carried balance.  Creditor 1.c\nclaimed $13,600.00 in owed principal, interest and assorted charges and fees.  Shortly\nafter receiving creditor 1.c\u2019s legal complaint, she consulted a local attorney to assist her\n\n4\nin responding to the complaint (R.T., at 83-84).  Records document her attorney\u2019s\nobtaining a favorable judgment against creditor 1.c in February 2008 (see ex. L).\nBesides her creditor 1.c debt, Applicant encountered problems in resolving her\ncreditor 1.b debt.  Records indicate that she opened this credit card account in March\n1998 and last used the card in October 2003 (see exs. 3, 4 and 5). This creditor 1.b\naccount has since been sold several times to different collection agencies.  Applicant\u2019s\nlast credit report of September 2007 reflects a $6,847.00 balance.  While Applicant\nadmits to using the card and being indebted to creditor 1.b, she disputes the $10,643.00\ncurrently demanded by the creditor. \nApplicant continued making regular payments on her creditor 1.b account\nbetween 2000 and 2002 until she lost her State 1 job in April 2002 (R.T., at 73).  Having\nlost her State 1 job, she was forced to cease making monthly payments on this account\nas well.  Upon resuming full time employment in State 2 in June 2003, she worked out a\npayment arrangement with the 1.b creditor (in September 2003).  Under this payment\narrangement, she made regular $100.00 payments to the creditor on the carried\nbalance of $7,761.14 (see ex. F; R.T., at 73-74) until approximately June 2004, when\nshe lost her  job in State 2 and relocated to State 3 to accept a new position (R.T., at\n73). \nFollowing the advice of her CCCS counselor, Applicant hand-wrote a note to\ncreditor 1.b (similar to the one she wrote to creditor 1.c), advising the creditor of her\ncircumstances and promising to resume her payments as soon as she could get settled\nin State 3 (R.T., at 54-56).  While she never received any written response to her note,\nshe soon began receiving harassing phone calls from creditor 1.b\u2019s collection agent.\nApplicant subsequently learned that the collection agent for creditor 1.b had\nwithdrawn $102.95 from her checking account in August 2004 without permission,\nostensibly to cover one of her monthly payments (see ex. M; R.T., at 55-57).  While\nApplicant was able to reverse the debit with her bank, and close her account (R.T., at\n57), she never received any satisfactory answers from the creditor or its agent.  As a\nresult, she stopped making  payments to creditor 1.b on her payment plan.  While she\nremains interested in satisfying this debt, she has not been able to reach the creditor\n(R.T., at 83).\n In February 2008, Applicant through her retained counsel filed a formal dispute\nwith the credit reporting agencies concerning the creditor 1.b debt (see exs. A and B).\nTo date, she has not received as response from either of the reporting agencies or the\ncreditor itself.  \nCurrently, Applicant has an annualized net pay stream of $57,252.00 (effective\nFebruary 25, 2008).  This works out to between $3,200.00 and $4,000.00 a month\n(compare exs. D and N; R.T., at 87).   After deducting her estimated monthly expenses\n($2,325.00), she has a net monthly remainder of between $875.00 and $1,675.00 a\nmonth (R.T., at 88-94).  With her current income, she has been able to stay current with\n\n5\nher other debts listed in her most recent credit report (see ex. 3; R.T., at 62).   Applicant\nremains committed to paying her creditor 1.b debt, if she can successfully enlist the\ncreditor to return her calls.  \nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisor and facility security officer (FSO).\nBoth describe Applicant as a very responsible employee (R.T., at 42-46).  As a\ntestament to her trustworthiness, she has been afforded wide access to her\ndepartment\u2019s highest level of secured information (R.T., at 42).  DoD\u2019s deputy program\nmanager who is familiar with Applicant\u2019s customer support efforts extols her\ncontributions as a model customer service representative who provides an impressive\nexample of worthy emulation (see ex. J). \nPolicies\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which gave DOHA responsibility to provide\ntrustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases cover security clearance\napplications, and are used to address trustworthy determinations as well.  These\nGuidelines require the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the\n\"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance\nshould be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to\nassess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account\nthe pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of\nthe Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist\nthe judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\n\n6\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a senior customer service representative for a defense contractor\nwho accumulated a number of delinquent debts following her divorce and a series of\njob losses.  Considered together, and without resolution, they raise trust concerns over\nher application for a public trust position.  \nTrust concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and her past inability to address most of these debts\n\n7\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC\n19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to income shortages following her\ndivorce, and experienced employment problems in two different states.  Employment\nlosses are attributable to her recurrent problems following her successful bankruptcy\ndischarge in 1994.  Applicant\u2019s only two listed debts (with creditors 1.b and 1.c)\nrepresent credit card accounts that she has long disputed over added amounts and\naggressive collection practices.  One of the creditors (creditor 1.c) initiated debt\nenforcement  proceedings after Applicant stopped making monthly payments in June\n2004 under a previous payment arrangement with the creditor. Just this year the\ncreditor\u2019s claims was dismissed for failure to prosecute, and Applicant is credited with\nfavorably resolving this debt in her favor. \n Like creditor 1.c, Applicant\u2019s creditor 1.b debt arose out of a credit card account\nthat became delinquent and was assigned to collection.  She subsequently completed\na payment plan with one of this creditor\u2019s collection agents and made monthly\npayments on this account for over a year (i.e., between June 2003 and June 2004)\nbefore stopping altogether after learning of the creditor\u2019s unauthorized accessing of her\nchecking account.  Subsequent efforts to contact this creditor\u2019s most recent collections\nagent to work out a repayment plan have so far been unsuccessful. Applicant\ncontinues to dispute the carried amount owed on this creditor 1.b debt. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with her\ndivorce and recurrent employment losses in two different states, and the limited\nresources she had available to her after exhausting her savings and retirement\naccounts, Applicant may rely on MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations.  Extenuating circumstances impacted Applicant for extended\nperiods following employment losses, ensuing relocations, and the depletion of her own\nresources.   \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her credible proofs of\nfavorably resolving her creditor 1.c debt and establishing a current payment record with\nmost of her other creditors.  Only creditor 1.b remains outstanding.  Because it is a\nrelatively large debt (now over $10,000.00, with accrued interest and late fees), it\nremains a sources of some potential security concern. \nAge of the debts referenced in the SOR (both the creditor 1.b debt and the debts\ndischarged in Applicant\u2019s 1994 bankruptcy) that are at issue is covered by three of the\nmitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\n\n8\njudgment,\u201d has applicability, while not dispositive.  MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some\napplicability.  MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d has applicability as well with respect to creditor 1.c, and to some extent with\ncreditor 1.b.   \nApplicant continues to dispute the amount claimed by creditor 1.b; although, she\nacknowledged owing the creditor money, and has made efforts in the past to address\nthe debt with a payment plan.  For this single account, regardless of whether it reflects\nan otherwise valid debt owing, it either is or soon  may no longer be enforceable under\neither State 1's (where the account originated) applicable statute of limitations for\nwritten contracts, or State 3's (where Applicant has resided since June 2004).  \nThe state statute of limitations in both State 1 for claims based on a written\ncontract is four years (see C. Code Civ. Pro, \u00a7\u00a7 337 (stating suit on written obligations\nmust be filed within four years) and 343 (2007)).  Like state 1, State 3 also employes a\nfour-year time bar for filing suit on written obligations (see \u00a716.004(a)(3) of T Civ.\nPractice and Remedies Code) and claims not otherwise provided for (see \u00a716.051 of T\nCiv. Practice and Remedies Code).  Applicant\u2019s creditor 1.b debt was opened in 1998\nand actively maintained through April 2002.  Following a year of suspended payments\non this account, Applicant initiated monthly payments in June 2003 pursuant to a\npayment plan with the creditor.  \nSo, by June 2004 when Applicant ceased making any further payments on her\ncreditor 1.b account, the applicable state statute of limitation had likely been tolled by\nher re-affirmation of the creditor 1.b debt.  Were the controlling statute of limitation to\nstart afresh with Applicant\u2019s last suspension of payments in June 2004, the statute in\neither State would appear to still have several months of life in it before it could be\npotentially used to bar any enforcement action against creditor 1.b\u2019s debt claim. Still,\nthere would appear to be little risk of collection on the debt by creditor 1.b at this time,\nor justification for attributing judgment lapses to Applicant under all the circumstances\nconsidered.     \nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for\ndiscouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.\nThey have never been equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue\ncreditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  Potentially applicable statutes\nof limitation have not, in turn, been recognized by our Appeal Board to absorb security\nrisks associated with unresolved delinquent debts. \n Weight, if any, to be assigned to potentially applicable statutes of limitations\nunder the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the circumstances\nsurrounding the existing debts, and must take account of the Applicant\u2019s entire history\nof demonstrated trust and responsibility.  Viewed in this whole person light, the\n\n9\ncontrolling state statutes of limitation for written contracts in either State 1 or State 3\n(which is ever determined to apply) is entitled to be accorded mitigation weight in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk. \nBecause the relevant statutes of limitations extant in States 1 and 3 may not  yet\nhave ripened into fully applicable enforcement bars, Applicant may not claim the\nbenefits of either or both statutes for several more months.  She is at least close\nenough to the four-year elapse time in both states, however, to consider the potential\navailability of the bar as a source of mitigation of her creditor 1.b debt. \n                                                       \nAlthough the counseling advice Applicant relied on with CCCS is relatively aged\n(2004), she is entitled to some counseling credit and earnest efforts on her part in\nlooking for sources of financial advice with the resources available to her and ultimately\nretaining an attorney to help with her two problem debts carried in her credit reports.\nApplicant may take limited advantage MC 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Based on her initiated efforts to date, prospects\nfor her gaining important insights in handling her finances in the future appear to be\npromising.\nHolding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person certified to hold a position of trust is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the public trust position.  While the principal\nconcern of a public trust employee\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to\ncoercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as\nhere).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, her documented steps taken to resolve them, and the\nresponsibility and trustworthiness she is credited with in her work, Applicant mitigates\ntrust concerns related to both her disputed debts and her proven debt delinquencies.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-\nparagraphs 1.a through 1.c of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s application for a\npublic trust position.

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline C \n(Foreign Preference) for Applicant.  \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n1 \n \nJune 29, 2009\n\n2 \n \n \nShe answered the SOR in writing on March 16, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on March 26, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 18, 2009, and I received the \ncase assignment on May 21, 2009.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 29, 2009, scheduling the case for June \n9, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on \nher own behalf, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received \nwithout objection.  \n \nI held the record open until June 23, 2009, to afford the Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional material.

After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old drug interaction pharmacist, who has been employed \nby her defense contractor employer since January 2006. GE 1, Tr. 27. She seeks to \nretain her access to sensitive information in conjunction with a public trust position as a \ncondition of her employment. Tr. 27. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Poland in January 1973, where she was raised, educated, \nand spent her formative years. In 1995, she won the U.S. State Department sponsored \n\u201cgreen card lottery\u201d and in June of that year at age 22, she immigrated to the U.S. In \nJune 2005, she became a U.S. citizen, and in June 2006, she was issued her U.S. \npassport.  GE 1, GE 3, Tr. 21-22. \n \n \nApplicant is highly educated. She was awarded a master\u2019s degree in \npharmaceutical science in July 1998 from a Polish university, and was later awarded a \ndoctorate degree in pharmacy in May 2005 from a U.S. university. GE 1, Tr. 23-25. \n \n \nApplicant married her husband in the U.S. in July 1995. Her husband, like her, \nwas born and raised in Poland, and immigrated to the U.S. He too is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen, and is a U.S. Government employee. Applicant\u2019s parents reside in the U.S. and \nare permanent resident aliens. Applicant\u2019s in-laws are elderly and reside in Poland. \nNeither Applicant nor her husband have any financial interests in Poland. GE 3, Tr. 25-\n27. Applicant and her husband have two children, a nine-year-old daughter, and a one-\nyear-old son. Both children are U.S. citizens. GE 1, Tr. 19-20.  \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s birth in Poland to Polish parents, she holds dual \ncitizenship. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) In September 2004, she applied for and was issued a Polish \n\n3 \n \npassport with an expiration date in September 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) She applied for a \nPolish passport for ease of travel to Poland. GE 3. In October 2006, she used her Polish \npassport for a 10-day family visit to Poland. She was accompanied by her husband and \noldest child. GE 3. Contrary to what was alleged in the SOR, she used her Polish \npassport to enter Poland and used her U.S. passport to exit Poland. Response to SOR, \nGE 3. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) At the time, Applicant was unaware that possession or use of a \nPolish passport would later cause a security concern. \n \n \nDuring a December 2006 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, \nApplicant stated she would be willing to renounce her dual citizenship. GE 3. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted documentation that her Polish passport was destroyed by \nshredding on June 19, 2009, and the shredded contents were disposed in a secure \ndisposal bin. AE C. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from her supervisor, who stated Applicant \n\u201cis an asset to the company and does a great job.\u201d AE D. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n4 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant held dual citizenship with Poland and \nheld a valid Polish passport. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) has been raised by the evidence.  \n\n5 \n \n                                                          \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \nmitigating to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and  \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship was derived from her birth in Poland. Applicant \nexpressed a willingness to renounce her dual citizenship during her December 2006 \nOPM interview. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that her Polish passport \nhad been destroyed. In light of the evidence presented and Applicant\u2019s affirmative \naction to comply with the Directive, this concern is deemed mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n11(a), 11(b), and 11(e). \n \nThe \nobjective \nof \na \ntrustworthiness \ndetermination \nis \nthe \nfair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nsensitive information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a \nperson by the totality of her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its \nown merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound \njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this \ncase, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the \nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign preference security concern. She has overcome the case against \nher and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion.  \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to a public trust position. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

He works as a software engineer for a defense contractor. The SOR lists 15 delinquent debts, including a mortgage loan debt of $141,841 resulting from his June 2007 home foreclosure, defaulted student loans totaling $140,786 on which Applicant has not made any payments since May 2007, an auto repossession debt balance of $16,879, three credit card debts totaling $5,581, medical debts of $1,351, a collector owed $130, another creditor or collector owed $8,123, and a collector owed $3,370. These debts total $318,061. (Items 1, 6-8) Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2004. It was terminated or dismissed on March 20, 2007, for Applicant\u2019s failure to continue making the court- ordered payments. (Items 4, 7) Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his separation and pending divorce from his wife. Applicant presented no evidence concerning the details of his debts, income during the marriage, or other specific information concerning his finances.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nOn September 28, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application\n(SF 86). On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nto Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 16, 2007. He requested his\ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn December 26, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written\ncase.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the\nApplicant. He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on January 7, 2008.\nApplicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that would\nhave expired on February 6, 2008. I received the case assignment on March 27, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted all the factual\nallegations in the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 36 years old, married and undergoing a divorce, and has two\nchildren.  He works as a software engineer for a defense contractor.  The SOR lists 15\ndelinquent debts, including a mortgage loan debt of $141,841 resulting from his June\n2007 home foreclosure, defaulted student loans totaling $140,786 on which Applicant\nhas not made any payments since May 2007, an auto repossession debt balance of\n$16,879, three credit card debts totaling $5,581, medical debts of $1,351, a collector\nowed $130, another creditor or collector owed $8,123, and a collector owed $3,370.\nThese debts total $318,061. (Items 1, 6-8)\nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2004.  It was terminated or\ndismissed on March 20, 2007, for Applicant\u2019s failure to continue making the court-\nordered payments. (Items 4, 7)\nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his separation and pending divorce\nfrom his wife.  Applicant presented no evidence concerning the details of his debts,\nincome during the marriage, or other specific information concerning his finances.  He\ndid not provide any information on repayment plans for his delinquent debts.\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of February 27, 2007, and October 17, 2007, show the debts\nlisted in the SOR as being due and owing. (Items 5-8)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\n\n3\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n4\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt and\nhas been unable or unwilling  to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\nprovided no evidence that makes this mitigating condition (MC) applicable.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant suggested his\ndivorce affected his financial status, but provided insufficient evidence to substantiate\nhis three sentence statement that a divorce was pending and his marital difficulties\ncaused his financial problems.  His written presentation is not sufficiently persuasive for\napplication of this MC.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ AG \u00b6 20(e) applies if the \u201cindividual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  Applicant did not submit any evidence to support these\nMC; hence, they do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n5\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems began,\nApplicant was a mature adult. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He accumulated $318,000 of debt,\ndid not submit any persuasive and credible evidence that he has a repayment plan or\nrepaid any of these debts. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Applicant has not undergone any\nsignificant behavioral changes or sought credit counseling. (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  The\nmagnitude of his debts could be a source of improper pressure or duress. (See AG &\n2(a)(8).)  His debts, the number and amount, are a security concern. (See AG &\n2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  I conclude the financial considerations security concern against\nApplicant.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline\nG is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:  Applicant had consumed alcohol, at times\nin excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 1976 to at least August 2007.  He was a\n\u201cheavy drinker\u201d from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  He attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA)\nmeetings during the 1994-95 time frame.\nApplicant was arrested on suspicion of Driving a Vehicle While Under the Influence (DUI)\nin October 2004.  He admitted to consuming about six beers prior to his arrest.  The arrest resulted\nfrom him almost striking a police car.  Applicant pled nolo contendere to a charge of reckless driving\nand was placed on probation, fined, and required to attend six alcohol awareness counseling sessions.\nApplicant was again arrested and charged with DUI in May 2006.  He had attended a picnic where\nhe consumed a large number of alcoholic beverages.  At the time of the arrest, his blood alcohol\nconcentration (BAC) was measured at 0.20.  Applicant pled nolo contendere to that charge, was\nplaced on probation, fined, required to attend an alcohol awareness program, had an ignition lock\nsystem installed on his vehicle, and attended 20 weeks of outpatient alcohol counseling from June\nto December 2006.  He was told during his counseling sessions he had \u201ca potential alcohol problem.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to consuming small amounts of alcohol following his 2006 arrest, but\nasserted that he last consumed alcohol on August 24, 2007, which was about the date he received\ninterrogatories from DOHA inquiring about his use of alcohol.  He admitted his motivation for\nquitting drinking alcohol was due to a concern about his security clearance and a personal desire to\nabstain.  Applicant attended 17 AA meetings between November 2007 and January 2008.  He began\nattendance at an outpatient alcohol and drug abuse program in February 2008.  His first meeting in\nthat program was the night before the hearing in this case.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Air Force from 1976 to 1996.  He held a security clearance for\napproximately 30 years without incident.\n  \n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge erred in finding that Applicant had seriously minimized his alcohol use and that his\nattendance in AA and outpatient treatment was solely motivated by the threatened loss of his security\nclearance.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\n\n3\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \n(2) Applicant also argues that the favorable evidence in the record was sufficient, as a matter\nof law, to overcome any security concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s conduct.  Specifically, he\ncontends that: (a) his 2004 and 2006 DUI charges were isolated incidents, that were not recent, and\ndo not indicate a pattern; and (b) he has established a plan of abstinence, started appropriate\ntreatment, and there are clear indications that his alcohol problem is being resolved and is under\ncontrol.  Finally, he notes that he has strong community ties and that he has held a security clearance\nwithout incident for 30 years.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. July 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of\nwork performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJuly 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails\nto properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such\ninformation.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of security\nviolations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\n\n4\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  Decision at 4-5.  He reasonably explained why the\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  Id. at 5.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nrecord evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received\nby DOHA on November 26, 2007. Applicant denied all SOR allegations and requested a\nhearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on January 3, 2008, and\nreassigned to me on January 4, 2008, to be heard in conjunction with other cases I had\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 13, 2008\n\n2\nscheduled in the same region. A notice of hearing was issued on January 14, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for February 5, 2008. The hearing was conducted as scheduled.\nThe government submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 & 2, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 & 2,\nand admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on February\n27, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 54 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nOctober 1997. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from May 1976 until his\nretirement in June 1996. He was a technical sergeant (paygrade E-6) at the time of his\nretirement. Applicant has held a security clearance for approximately 30 years. No prior\nadverse action has been taken to revoke of downgrade his security clearance eligibility.\nApplicant was first married in July 1974. That marriage ended in divorce in June\n1984. He again married in January 1988. That marriage ended in divorce in July 2006. He\nhas two adult children and one adult step-child.      \nIn October 2004, Applicant was arrested on suspicion of Driving a Vehicle While\nUnder the Influence (DUI). Applicant admits to consuming about six beers while bowling\nprior to his arrest. The arrest resulted from him almost striking a police car that was\nstopped with its lights off in a road crossover. Applicant pled nolo contendere to a charge\nof reckless driving and was placed on probation, fined, and required to attend six alcohol\nawareness counseling sessions. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in May 2006. His wife had\nunexpectedly announced she was leaving him earlier the day of his arrest and had him\ndrive her to the airport. After dropping her off, Applicant attended a Memorial Day picnic\nat a veteran\u2019s organization where he consumed a large number of alcoholic beverages. His\nblood alcohol concentration (BAC) was measured at 0.20 when he was arrested. Applicant\npled nolo contendere to the DUI charge, was placed on probation, fined, required to attend\nan alcohol awareness program, had a ignition lock system installed on his vehicle, and\nattended 20 weeks of outpatient alcohol counseling from June to December 2006. He was\ntold during his counseling sessions he had \u201ca potential alcohol problem\u201d (Tr. p. 32).  \nApplicant admits to being a \u201cheavy drinker\u201d while in the Air Force, but claims the\nheavy drinking was confined to a period extending from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.\nHowever, he also admits attending Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings during the 1994-\n95 time frame. He claims his attendance at those meetings was motivated at the\nsuggestion of a person who presented an alcohol awareness lecture as part of routine\nmilitary training and because \u201cI was actually wondering if I had a serious problem back\nthen\u201d (Tr. p. 53). \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n3\nApplicant admits consuming small amounts of alcohol following his 2006 arrest, but\nclaims he last consumed alcohol on August 24, 2007, which was about the date he\nreceived interrogatories from DOHA inquiring about his use of alcohol. He admits his\nmotivation for quitting drinking alcohol was at least in part motivated by concern over his\nsecurity clearance, which provided a \u201cwake up call\u201d for him. However, he also asserts it\nwas motivated by his personal desire to abstain. \nApplicant submitted a log indicating he attended 17 AA meetings between\nNovember 27, 2007 and January 31, 2008 (AE 1). He also submitted a letter indicating he\nbegan attendance at an outpatient alcohol and drug abuse program on February 4, 2008\n(AE 2). He testified he attended his first meeting in that program the night before the\nhearing held in this case. Applicant testified he had unsuccessfully attempted to earlier\nenroll in a Veteran\u2019s Administration sponsored alcohol awareness program.        \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption)\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant was arrested for alcohol-related offenses in 2004 and again in 2006. In\n2004, he was almost involved in an accident with a stopped police car and was convicted\nof Reckless Driving of following his plea of nolo contendere. He admits to having\nconsumed about six beers prior to the 2004 arrest. His 0.20 BAC following the 2006 arrest\nsubstantiates that he was grossly intoxicated at the time. He was convicted of DUI, placed\non probation, required to attend lengthy counseling sessions, and had an ignition interlock\nplaced on his car. Disqualifying Condition (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing\nthe peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent applies.     \nApplicant admits being a heavy drinker while in the Air Force but claims the\nexcessive drinking was confined to a relatively few years during the early part of his military\ncareer. However, he also admits attending AA meeting for a year or so toward the end of\nhis military career because he was concerned he might have a serious alcohol problem.\nAlthough he was told during counseling in 2006 he had a potential alcohol problem, he\ncontinued to consume alcohol, at least in small amounts, until he became aware it created\na security concern. He only recently again began regular attendance at AA meetings, and\nonly the day before the hearing enrolled in another alcohol counseling program. Together\nwith his two alcohol-related convictions, these facts strongly indicate Applicant has and is\nseriously minimizing his alcohol use and abuse and that his recent attendance at AA\n\n MC 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\n12\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n    MC 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence\nof actions to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser);\n    MC 23(c): the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program,\nhas no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n    MC 23(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation\nalong with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous\nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n5\nmeetings and entering into an outpatient program is solely motivated by concern over the\npossible loss of his security clearance.\nThe relatively short length of time that has passed since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-\nrelated offense, his admitted excessive alcohol consumption in the 1970s and 1980s, his\nattendance at AA meetings during the mid-1990s, his 2004 alcohol-related arrest, and his\nconsumption of alcohol after being told he might have a serious alcohol problem during a\ncounseling program prohibit application of any mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23.12\nAccordingly, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption concern that\nexists as a result of his alcohol-related arrests, history of excessive alcohol consumption,\nand continued use of alcohol after being informed he potentially had a serious alcohol\nproblem.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns caused by his alcohol consumption. He has failed to overcome the case against\nhim in this regard or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline G is decided\nagainst Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDennis J. Sysko, Esq. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 14, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information),\nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 18, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in denying Department\nCounsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR; whether the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.  Finding error,\nwe reverse.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer\nworking for a Defense contractor.  He holds a B.S. degree in chemistry.\nIn 1995 he was reassigned to a different job location, where he remained until 2004.  He held\na Top Secret clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access.  Applicant\u2019s duties\nincluded preparing a weekly unclassified report.  To do so, he maintained unclassified logs on his\nprogram\u2019s host computer.  He would send the reports to his employer\u2019s home office by means of a\ncompany computer from his home.  \nNormally, he would print out a copy of the log and take it home with him.  However, in 1998,\nhe took home a disk, inserted it into his company computer, and copied the needed files.  He did so\nbecause he had grown tired of having to retype the logs at home from the hard copies.  This disk, like\nall of the disks at his workplace, was labeled Secret.  He knew that taking the disk home was\nprohibited and that the security guards would have made him return it if they discovered it as he\nchecked out of his work area.  Therefore, he concealed the disk in his pants pocket as he exited.  He\nreturned the disk the next day.  \nApplicant had improperly removed a disk from his workplace on a prior occasion as well.\nHis task was to write an operations manual and, in furtherance thereof, he downloaded two files from\na classified computer system onto two disks, took them from his workplace, and loaded them onto\nhis company-issued computer.  One of the programs he downloaded was classified.  After\ndiscovering this, Applicant deleted it from his computer.  He reported neither of these incidents to\nhis employer until 2004, after a routine polygraph examination conducted by another DoD agency.\nTwice in 2003, and on at least one prior occasion, Applicant removed e-mails with classified\nbanners to his home.  Each time he returned them to his workplace and shredded them.  Although\nthese incidents were not intentional, he did not report them to his employer.  \nIn 1997, Applicant copied an unclassified phone directory from a coworker\u2019s computer\nwithout the coworker\u2019s knowledge or permission.  He noticed that the coworker had left his\ncomputer unsecured.  He perused the phone directory which was displayed on the computer screen\nand copied it onto a classified disk, after which he copied it onto his computer.  He did not tell his\n\nworker about this, nor did he report the incident until 2004.  \nIn 2003, Applicant inserted a classified disk into a computer classified at a higher level.  He\ndid so to spell check a document he needed for a presentation.  He failed to write-protect the disk,\nas required by security regulations.  \nIn February 2004, Applicant was subjected to three polygraph examinations.  The following\nApril, Applicants access to SCI was revoked.  Since losing his SCI access, Applicant has received\ncounseling regarding security procedures.  He had committed only one security violation in the years\nprior to 1995, the date of his reassignment to the satellite facility.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation at work for being security-conscious.  In addition,\na psychologist who interviewed Applicant concluded that he was \u201csensitized to security matters.\u201d\nDecision at 8.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and (e); 35(a); and 41(a).  \n1\nAn applicant who deliberately engages in security violations demonstrates a disregard for,\nor indifference to, national security interests and undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the\nindustrial security program.  ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  Once it is\nestablished that an applicant has committed a security violation, he has a very heavy burden of\ndemonstrating that he should be entrusted with classified information.  Such violations strike at the\nheart of the Industrial Security Program and the Judge must give any claims of reform and\nrehabilitation strict scrutiny.  ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 9 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001) see also Egan,\nsupra, at 527 (\u201cThis Court has recognized the Government\u2019s \u2018compelling interest\u2019 in withholding\nnational security information from unauthorized persons in the course of executive business.\u201d)    \nFactual Sufficiency\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge failed to make findings about and give appropriate\nconsideration to, the findings of a prior Adjudication Board.  Thus, the Judge failed to consider an\nimportant aspect of the case and, consequently, his decision ran counter to the weight of the\nevidence.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case, due to\nhis having obtained training on security vigilance and the passage of time since his last infraction.1\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion does not take the full measure\nof the Government\u2019s security concerns about Applicant, citing to record evidence not explicitly\nreferenced by the Judge.  He notes evidence contained in Government Exhibit 2, Answers to\nInterrogatories, dated January 5, 2009, specifically a document from the Adjudication Board which\nsummarized the infractions underlying Applicant\u2019s loss of SCI access.  Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that this document paints Applicant\u2019s security violations in a less favorable\ncontext than is found in the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s brief quotes liberally from this exhibit.  Among the most significant\nfacts contained therein are the following:\nDuring an interview, Applicant \u201cadmitted intentionally committing security infractions from\n1995 to 2004 to include deliberately removing classified magnetic media and unauthorized material\nto his home.\u201d\n\u201cSince approximately 1999, [Applicant] has deliberately concealed misuse of an unclassified\n[employer-issued] computer located inside of a SCIF.  This misuse included surfing the Internet,\nlooking at stock quotes, and buying things.  At some point, a coworker mentioned in passing that a\nsecurity officer had advised that personal use of the computer was unauthorized. [Applicant]\ndeliberately did not follow the guidance provided by the coworker, because he believed it was too\nrigid and rationalized he did not know what the real policy was, because no one in Security had told\n\nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, this evidence is relevant in evaluating Applicant\u2019s claims of rehabilitation\n2\nas well as the whole-person factors.  See Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(a). \nSee, e.g., DISCR Case No. 86-3753 at 7-9 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 1990), for a discussion of deliberate, intentional,\n3\nor willful conduct in the context of a security violations case.  This case states that conduct can be deliberate or willful\nif \u201cit is voluntary, conscious or purposeful, as opposed to accidental . . . or it involves a careless, reckless or intentional\ndisregard of whether one\u2019s conduct is prohibited by law.\u201d  This case also states that \u201cconduct can be deliberate,\nintentional or willful even absent any evidence of evil motive or malicious intent.\u201d  \nhim the policy directly . . .\u201d  \n2\n\u201cHe deliberately did not report security violations, because it is stressful and embarrassing,\ntakes time, and he thought he could get away with it.\u201d\n\u201cBetween 2001 and February 2003, [Applicant] removed unauthorized material from the\nSCIF once a week . . . He deliberately concealed these violations until confronted with [redacted]\npolygraph test results . . . During subsequent discussion, he admitted to removing unclassified\nmaterials [redacted] on the average of four times a week.\u201d\n\u201c[H]e recalled that during a bag search a Security Officer found materials with classified\nbanners on one or two occasions that he was unaware of being in his bag.  On those occasions,\n[Applicant] was instructed by the Security Officer to return the material to his office inside the SCIF.\nWhen asked if he deliberately disregarded those instructions by purposely concealing the discovered\nmaterials on his person prior to exiting the building, he responded that it was possible.\u201d  \n\u201c[Applicant] confirmed the information about deliberately removing unauthorized material\nbetween 2001 and February 2004. [Applicant] knew the guards would question him and make him\nreturn the material to his office if they found it in his bag, so he purposefully put it in his pockets.\n[Applicant] knew what he was doing was against facility regulations.\u201d\nThe evidence cited above is, in some particulars, corroborated by Applicant\u2019s own evidence\nat the hearing.  However, it differs from Applicant\u2019s presentation in that it paints a picture of an\nongoing pattern of knowing and willful security violations, in contradistinction to Applicant\u2019s\ncontention of merely inadvertent breaches.   In doing so, it is corroborated by another document\n3\ncontained in GE 2, a memo for record (MFR) prepared by Applicant\u2019s supervisor at the time of his\npolygraph exams.  This MFR describes Applicant as approaching the supervisor on two occasions\nduring the course of the exams and advising about his having taken disks from the workplace and\nhaving improperly accessed his coworker\u2019s computer to download the phone directory.  The tenor\nof this MFR is that Applicant was, for the first time, admitting to security breaches which he had\nknowingly committed.  There is nothing in this MFR to support or to imply that Applicant was\nconcerned that he was, in response to an aggressive polygrapher, overstating his culpability, as he\ncontended at the hearing.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that the cited material from GE\n2 constitutes substantial evidence of a more extensive pattern of willful security violations than was\n\nThe Judge stated, \u201cOver the years, Applicant negligently removed classified e-mail and intentionally removed\n4\nunauthorized information from the SCIF.\u201d  Decision at 9.  The substantial record evidence cited by Department Counsel\ndemonstrates that Applicant\u2019s security violations were significantly more willful than is suggested by the Judge\u2019s use of\nthe term \u201cnegligently.\u201d  While Applicant contended that he never intentionally removed classified information from the\nSCIF, the evidence cited by Department Counsel points to voluntary, conscious, and purposeful attempts by Applicant\nto avoid legal strictures designed to protect classified information.  \nSee also Tr. at 88: \u201cI never intentionally took out classified information\u2013ever.  In terms of taking out a floppy\n5\ndiskette that was marked classified\u2013yes, that occurred around \u201898.\u201d  Compare this with Department Counsel\u2019s citation\nfrom GE 2, above, in which Applicant admitted that it was possible that he had failed to abide by a security guard\u2019s\ninstruction to return materials displaying a classified banner to his office.  \nset forth in the Judge\u2019s findings and analysis.     \n4\nMitigation\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case is\nundercut by record evidence impugning Applicant\u2019s credibility.  Applicant acknowledged that his\nhearing testimony was inconsistent with his prior statements in 2004, reflected in GE 2, concerning\nthe willful nature of his security infractions.  Tr. at 144.  The following inconsistent statements also\nshould have been analyzed by the Judge:  GE 2 contains a memo, dated November 5, 2004, signed\nboth by Applicant\u2019s attorney and by Applicant himself.  This memo was prepared in response to the\nproposed denial of SCI access.  In this document, concerning his removal of the computer disk from\nthe workplace, Applicant stated the following: \u201c[T]here were no guards whatsoever stationed in the\npart of the factory in which [Applicant] had been working.  The only guards on the premises were\nstationed at the front entrance to the building, and they do not routinely inspect papers or briefcases\nof people entering or leaving the building.\u201d  This contradicts Applicant\u2019s testimony in which he\nadmitted that the guards searched briefcases and that he concealed the disk in his pants \u201cin order to\ncircumvent security.\u201d  Tr. at 132.5\nAnother example is Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony concerning his failure to write-protect the\ndisk that he inserted into a computer with a higher level classification.  \nJudge: So, you deny this, correct?\nA:  That\u2019s correct . . . My contention is I\u2019m\u2013don\u2019t know whether I did nor did\nnot write-protect.  Tr. at 98-99.\nThis contention repeats an earlier one contained in the November 5, 2004, memo, in which\nhe stated that he did not recall failing to write-protect the disk.  However, only a bit later in the\nhearing, Applicant, in response to a question by his attorney, admitted to having failed in this\nresponsibility.  \u201cQ: You now recall not write-protecting?  A: That\u2019s correct.\u201d  Tr. at 106.  In\nadmitting that he did indeed fail to write-protect the disk, Applicant contradicted a version of events\nwhich he had apparently maintained over a course of years.  The Decision does not reflect a thorough\nexamination of Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements regarding a core subject of concern, or the\nacknowledged overarching inconsistency between his presentation at the hearing with his prior\n\nSee, e.g., Executive Order 13328, Oct. 8, 2001; Executive Order 13231, Oct. 16, 2001; Presidential News\n6\nConference, October 11, 2001; Presidential State of the Union, Jan. 29, 2002. \nstatements.\nWe also note another exchange during the hearing, which detracts from Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that he had been forthright in describing the actual extent of his security infractions.\nQ: Did you ever put any e-mails in your pants pocket to get past the\ncheckpoint, so the security guards wouldn\u2019t actually look at them?\nA: I don\u2019t recall that.  No sir.\nQ: Do you recall speaking with any of the investigators, in your different\ninterviews, and admitting having done such?\nA: I believe I mentioned about having papers in my pocket.  I was asked if I\never had papers in my pocket.\nQ: Why would you put papers in your pocket?\nA:   It was a place to carry them.  Tr. at 129.\n Such an answer is not credible, in light of other evidence, including Applicant\u2019s own\ntestimony immediately subsequent to this exchange, that he knew the guards would search his\nbriefcase but not his pants pocket as he left the building.  Tr. at 129-130.  The Judge did not discuss\nthe self-serving, and occasionally meretricious, nature of much of Applicant\u2019s presentation at the\nhearing, which seriously impairs his credibility determination and which undermines his overall\nfavorable conclusion as to mitigation.  \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation rests on the following contentions, drawn both from the\nrecord evidence and from his reply brief.  First, he asserted that many of his infractions had occurred\nafter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when his office was on a war time footing and he\nwas having to work many long hours, resulting in his being tired and in his having cut corners now\nand then in order to accomplish the mission.  Tr. at 79-81.  However, the Executive Branch indicated\nrepeatedly in the aftermath of the attacks on the United States that this was a time for increased\nsecurity vigilance rather than the opposite.   Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the stresses\n6\nApplicant endured in the months and years following September 11 were quantitatively greater than\nthose experienced by countless other contractor personnel who nevertheless managed to avoid\nsecurity breaches.\nSecond, Applicant contended that he did not intentionally take classified information out of\nhis workplace and he argued that his infractions were essentially negligent.  However, the record and\nto a lesser extent, the Judge\u2019s own findings, viewed as a whole, demonstrate that Applicant exhibited\na pattern of willful breaches of security policy, one of which did indeed result in actual removal of\n\nclassified information.  Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to advise his employer of his breaches, and his\nfinally doing so only following three polygraph exams, are consistent with a conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s infractions were more than excusable negligence.\nThird, Applicant noted that he has received counseling on security matters since his last\nrecorded infraction, which he contended impressed upon him the importance of protecting classified\nand other sensitive data.  However, Applicant testified that he received annual security training every\nyear from 1982 until 2004.  Tr. at 118.  This training clearly did not persuade him to follow the\nappropriate security requirements during the time alleged in the SOR.  Given Applicant\u2019s security\nhistory, it is not clear from the record or the decision why additional training in the same subject\nshould be viewed as mitigating.  \nFourth, Applicant contended that his last infraction occurred in 2004, and that, during the\nyears intervening between then and the date of the SOR, he has had no violations.  He argued that\nhe had thereby demonstrated rehabilitation.  However, the mitigating force of this evidence is\nvitiated by the Judge\u2019s finding that from March 2006 until October 2007 Applicant did not hold a\nsecurity clearance at all.  In any event, this evidence of good conduct should be balanced against\nother record evidence demonstrating years of willful security violations accompanied by a deliberate\nfailure to advise his employers concerning them, a failure which Applicant acknowledged was\nmotivated by embarrassment, by wishing to avoid getting into trouble and by his view that reporting\nthem would have been \u201ctime consuming.\u201d  Tr. at 135.  The Judge himself acknowledged that the\nremoteness of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, standing alone, is not sufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns in this case.  Decision at 11.  We conclude that the mitigating evidence supplied by\nApplicant or otherwise contained in the record is not enough to pass the strict scrutiny required of\nsecurity violation cases. \nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge erred in denying a motion to amend the\nSOR.  Allegation 2(b) reads as follows: \u201cBetween 1994 and 2004, you deliberately misused\nGovernment sponsored computers by inadvertently not write-protecting diskettes before using them\non a higher security level system and then re-using them on a lower security level system.\u201d \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend this allegation by striking the words \u201cdeliberately\u201d and\n\u201cinadvertently,\u201d thereby avoiding an obvious confusion.  Tr. at 263-264.  However, the Judge denied\nthe motion.  Tr. at 264-265.  \nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing in order to render it in conformity with the\nevidence, or for other good cause.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.  We review a Judge\u2019s ruling on a motion to\namend for abuse of discretion.  ISCR Case No. 06-19544 at 3 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008).  Department\nCounsel\u2019s motion was directed at clearing up a flaw in the allegation which, in the Judge\u2019s own\nwords, rendered it nonsensical.  Decision at 3.  By denying a motion to render the allegation\nintelligible, the Judge undermined his own formal finding on this allegation.  That is, on the face of\nthe Judge\u2019s decision it is not clear whether he entered his favorable finding due to the nature of the\nevidence or to the facial defect of the allegation.  There would have been no inconsistency in the\nJudge amending the allegation and then entering a favorable finding based upon the evidence.  As\nit stands, the Judge abused his discretion by not granting Department Counsel\u2019s motion or, in the\nalternative, by not granting Applicant\u2019s companion motion to strike the allegation in its entirety.\n\nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the briefs of the parties and the entirety\nof the record evidence.  The weight of the record evidence demonstrates (as do many of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings) that Applicant has repeatedly engaged in willful security violations, which is the very\nconduct which the industrial security program is designed to prevent.  When viewed in light of his\ninconsistent and otherwise self serving statements at the hearing, the record does not support the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his heavy burden of persuasion under Guideline K.\nNeither does it support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he has met his burden of persuasion under the\nremaining Guidelines, either as to the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Finding error, we reverse. Facts The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer working for a Defense contractor. He holds a B.S. degree in chemistry. In 1995 he was reassigned to a different job location, where he remained until 2004. He held a Top Secret clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access. Applicant\u2019s duties included preparing a weekly unclassified report. To do so, he maintained unclassified logs on his program\u2019s host computer. He would send the reports to his employer\u2019s home office by means of a company computer from his home. Normally, he would print out a copy of the log and take it home with him. However, in 1998, he took home a disk, inserted it into his company computer, and copied the needed files. He did so because he had grown tired of having to retype the logs at home from the hard copies. This disk, like all of the disks at his workplace, was labeled Secret. He knew that taking the disk home was prohibited and that the security guards would have made him return it if they discovered it as he checked out of his work area. Therefore, he concealed the disk in his pants pocket as he exited. He returned the disk the next day. Applicant had improperly removed a disk from his workplace on a prior occasion as well. His task was to write an operations manual and, in furtherance thereof, he downloaded two files from a classified computer system onto two disks, took them from his workplace, and loaded them onto his company-issued computer. One of the programs he downloaded was classified. After discovering this, Applicant deleted it from his computer. He reported neither of these incidents to his employer until 2004, after a routine polygraph examination conducted by another DoD agency. Twice in 2003, and on at least one prior occasion, Applicant removed e-mails with classified banners to his home. Each time he returned them to his workplace and shredded them. Although these incidents were not intentional, he did not report them to his employer. In 1997, Applicant copied an unclassified phone directory from a coworker\u2019s computer without the coworker\u2019s knowledge or permission. He noticed that the coworker had left his computer unsecured. He perused the phone directory which was displayed on the computer screen and copied it onto a classified disk, after which he copied it onto his computer. He did not tell his worker about this, nor did he report the incident until 2004. In 2003, Applicant inserted a classified disk into a computer classified at a higher level. He did so to spell check a document he needed for a presentation. He failed to write-protect the disk, as required by security regulations. In Febru",

After working for a few months as a chemist in the federal government shortly after graduation, he took a job with a defense contractor (Id.). He has been working for this employer ever since. According to a coworker who has shared an office with him since October 2007, he is \u201csomeone of high trust and reliability\u201d (AE E at 18).

Sysko, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nBetween 1995 and 2004, Applicant mishandled classified and/or sensitive\ninformation on multiple occasions and downloaded an unclassified phone directory from\na coworker\u2019s computer without his knowledge or permission. This conduct generates\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines K, Handling Protected Information, M, Use of\nInformation Technology, and E, Personal Conduct. Applicant has committed no security\ninfractions in more than five years. In that time, his security awareness has been\noutstanding. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn July 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns as outlined\nabove. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\nMarch 18, 2010\n\n2\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 4, 2009. He denied all of the allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2009. On\nNovember 10, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for December\n2, 2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. I received nine government exhibits,\nseven Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of four witnesses for the Applicant. The\ntranscript was received on December 10, 2009.\nPreliminary Rulings of Procedure and Evidence\nI. Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2 is Applicant\u2019s Response to DOHA Interrogatories,\nsigned on January 5, 2009. As originally proffered by Department Counsel, it consisted\nof among other things, records from another DoD agency including a 2004 clearance\ndecision revoking Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI),\nand three investigative reports, on which the agency based its decision. The\ninvestigative reports were summaries of polygraph examinations. In total, GE 2, as\noriginally proffered, was 166 pages long.\nOn November 30, 2009, Applicant\u2019s counsel filed a Motion in Limine seeking to\nexclude the investigative reports and the clearance decision. In doing so, he argued that\nthe polygraph examinations are inadmissible hearsay and are inherently unreliable\nabsent the opportunity to cross examine the investigator who conducted them. As for\nthe clearance decision, he argued that it, too, was inadmissible hearsay. \nIn a response filed on December 1, 2009, Department Counsel withdrew sections\nof proposed GE 2 pertaining to polygraph examination reports (pages 137-141, and\n144-152). Citing Appeal Board case law, he argued that the clearance decision was\nadmissible because the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) are not strictly applied to such\ndocuments (ISCR Case No. 02-12199 (App. Bd. August 8, 2005)).\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s analysis is correct. In ISCR litigation, the development of\na full and complete record supersedes the technical application of the FRE (Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.19). The admissibility of official records such as clearance decision statements are\ninstead governed by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, which states that they are admissible without\nauthenticating witnesses so long as they have \u201cbeen furnished by an investigatory\nagency pursuant to its responsibility in connection with assisting the Secretary of\nDefense, or the Department or Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified\ninformation within industry under E.O. 10865.\u201d \nAlthough the clearance decision was not furnished by an investigatory agency,\nas described in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, it was furnished by an authenticating witness -\nApplicant himself (see Applicant\u2019s testimony in response to Department Counsel\u2019s voir\n\n3\ndire questions regarding the clearance decision\u2019s authenticity (Tr. 44-59)).\nConsequently, I denied Applicant\u2019s Motion in Limine and admitted the clearance\ndecision.\nII. Motions Regarding SOR Subparagraph 2.b.\nSOR subparagraph 2.b reads as follows:\nBetween 1994 and 2004, you deliberately misused Government\nsponsored computers by inadvertently not write-protecting diskettes\nbefore using them on a higher security level system and then re-using\nthem on a lower security level system.\nAt the hearing\u2019s conclusion, Department Counsel moved to amend the allegation by\nstriking the words, \u201cdeliberately,\u201d and \u201cinadvertently\u201d. Appellant\u2019s counsel opposed the\nmotion, and moved to strike SOR subparagraph 2.b.\nI denied both motions. However, I agree with Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention\nthat SOR subparagraph 2.b is nonsensical because conduct cannot be both \u201cdeliberate\u201d\nand \u201cinadvertent.\u201d Consequently, I resolve SOR subparagraph 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old single man with no children. He earned a bachelor of\nscience degree in chemistry in 1980 (GE 1 at 1). After working for a few months as a\nchemist in the federal government shortly after graduation, he took a job with a defense\ncontractor (Id.). He has been working for this employer ever since. According to a\ncoworker who has shared an office with him since October 2007, he is \u201csomeone of\nhigh trust and reliability\u201d (AE E at 18). \nApplicant began his career with the defense contractor as an associate software\nengineer tasked with coding hardware diagnostics and assisting with hardware\ndebugging of custom signal processing systems (GE 2 at 61). By 1987, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer had promoted him to senior software engineer (Id.). \nIn 1995, Applicant\u2019s employer re-assigned him to a different location where he\nremained through 2004 (Tr. 72). During this time, he held a Top Secret clearance with\nSCI access. In March 1996, his employer promoted him to the position of senior field\nengineer (GE 2 at 61).

In 2001, Applicant\u2019s employer promoted him to the\nposition of site engineer in charge (Id.). In this position, he supervised 12 employees\nand supported multiple operational systems (Id.). He remained in this position through\nOctober 2004 (GE 1 at 1; Tr. 81). \n\nAs time progressed, this discrepancy was fixed (AE G).\n1\nAll of the diskettes at the SCIF were labelled \u2018SECRET\u201d (Id.). \n2\n4\nApplicant\u2019s home office communicated with him through e-mail sent from an\nunclassified system. The only accessible information system at the SCIF was classified,\nand the program host prohibited Applicant and his team members from using it to\ncorrespond with their home office (GE 2 at 119 - Affidavit of Coworker X, dated\nNovember 3, 2004; Tr 74). Consequently, the only method of sharing unclassified\ncorrespondence between the SCIF contractors and the home office was through home\ne-mails  (GE 2 at 122 - Affidavit of Coworker Y, dated November 3, 2004). \n1\nApplicant\u2019s home office required him, among other things, to prepare a weekly\nunclassified report summarizing the status of the upkeep of the information systems for\nwhich he was responsible (GE 3 at 11). This involved maintaining daily logs, then\ncompiling them into one report at the end of each week, and e-mailing them to the home\noffice. Applicant prepared and maintained the unclassified logs on the program host\u2019s\ncomputer diskettes.  \n2\nBecause Applicant could not use the program host\u2019s e-mail system to send his\nweekly reports to the home office, he had to print all of the daily program logs from the\nprogram host\u2019s diskettes, take them home, retype them onto his company-issued home\ncomputer, then prepare and e-mail the reports to his supervisor (Id.; Tr. 77, 173).\nPrinting the information from the diskettes and taking this information home posed no\nproblem; however, the program host\u2019s security regulations forbid taking any diskettes\nfrom the facility (GE 3 at 11).\nBecause of the labor-intensive nature of this task, Applicant began to fall behind\non his weekly reports. Once in 1998, he skipped the step of printing the daily program\nlogs and taking them home. Instead, he took home a diskette containing the daily\nprogram logs, inserted it into his company-issued home computer, copied the file\ncontaining the daily program logs, and used it to prepare his weekly report (Tr. 88). He\ndid so because he was tired of having to retype the program logs onto his home\ncomputer each time he prepared a weekly report (Tr. 135, 171; GE 2 at 29). He knew\nthat the program host\u2019s security regulations prohibited him from taking any magnetic\nmedia from the SCIF (GE 2 at 28). Also, he knew that the SCIF security guards would\nhave made him return the diskette if he had attempted to check it out of the SCIF (Tr.\n132). Applicant, therefore, concealed the diskette from the SCIF security guards by\nconcealing it in his pants pocket when he exited the SCIF (Id.; Tr. 132). He returned it\nthe next day (Tr. 132; GE 2 at 29). \nThis was not the first time Applicant improperly removed a diskette from a\nclassified facility (Tr. 173). In 1995, his employer tasked him with writing an operations\nmanual for an unclassified program (GE 2 at 29; Tr. 86). This work was to occur during\na temporary duty assignment (TDY) at another satellite location (GE 3 at 8). While\n\n5\nworking on the assignment, Applicant downloaded two files from a classified computer\nsystem onto two diskettes, removed the diskettes from the facility, and referred to the\ninformation on the diskettes, using his company-issued computer, to help him prepare\nthe manual (Id.). While preparing the manual, Applicant discovered that one of the\nprograms he had downloaded was classified (GE 3 at 9). He acknowledged that he did\nnot check the document thoroughly before downloading it (Id.). After discovering that\none of the programs was classified, Applicant deleted it from his computer (GE 2 at 30).\nHe does not recall whether he deleted it from the diskette (Id.). No record evidence\nindicates that he knew one of the diskettes contained classified information before he\ntook it from the facility, or that he surreptitiously removed them from the facility knowing\nthat one contained classified information.\nApplicant reported neither security violation to his facility security officer until\napproximately nine years later, in February 2004, after a routine polygraph examination\nthat another DoD agency conducted (GE 3 at 9; see also GE 3 at 50 - Security Violation\nReport, dated February 9, 2004). He did not immediately report these security violations\nbecause he was afraid of losing his security clearance (Tr. 135).\nOver the years, Applicant took other materials from the SCIF to assist him in his\nwork at home (Tr. 125-127). The program host prohibited removing material that\nreferenced the program regardless of whether the material was classified (Tr. 126).\nApplicant acknowledged that a few of the materials he took home \u201cwere ones that if\nsomebody was familiar with the program [he or she] could read that piece of paper and\nfigure out it was about that program\u201d (Tr. 127). On some occasions through February\n2004, he concealed unauthorized information from the SCIF security (GE 3 at 27). He\nknew this was against SCIF regulations, but considered that adhering to these particular\nSCIF regulations impeded his job responsibilities, and disclosing his violations would be\n\u201ctime-consuming and embarrassing (Tr. 135).\nTwice in 2003, and once or twice between 1994 and 2003, Applicant accidentally\nremoved e-mails with classified banners to his home (GE 2 at 27). He did not know\nwhether the body of the e-mails contained classified data or if the messages were\naccidentally marked classified (Id.). Each time this happened, he returned them to the\nSCIF and shredded them (Id.). He did not report this activity to the requisite security\nauthorities. He never intentionally removed classified e-mails (Tr. 89). \nIn 1997, Applicant copied an unclassified phone directory from a coworker\u2019s\ncomputer without his knowledge or permission (Tr. 107). The coworker\u2019s work station\nwas located in the same room as Applicant\u2019s work station (Tr. 107). One day, Applicant\nnoticed that his coworker left his computer unattended and unsecured, with a phone\ndirectory on the screen. He perused it, and concluded that he needed some of the\ncontacts in the phone directory for \u201coperational support\u201d (Tr. 108). He then copied the\nfile onto one of his floppy disks, then copied it onto his computer (Tr. 108). The disk\nused was classified at the same level as the coworker\u2019s computer (Tr. 142). The phone\ndirectory was not classified (GE 3 at 11). After copying the information, Applicant did not\ntell his coworker (Tr. 108). Applicant did not report the 1997 misuse of the information\n\nThe record is unclear as to why Applicant did not hold a security clearance during this period.\n3\n6\nsystem until seven years later, in February 2004, after his second meeting with the\nSCIF\u2019s facility security officer (GE 3 at 57).\nIn 2003, Applicant prepared a presentation on a Secret-level laptop (Tr. 93). The\npresentation was unclassified (Tr. 94). Shortly before making the presentation,\nApplicant decided to spell check it; however, the laptop lacked a spell-checker program\n(Tr. 93). Applicant then saved the presentation on a 3.5 inch floppy disk and inserted it\ninto a computer system, classified at a higher level, that had the spell-checker program\n(Tr. 94). He then spell-checked the presentation and made the necessary corrections.\nHe failed to write-protect the floppy disk before inserting it into the higher level-classified\ncomputer, as required by security regulations (Tr. 95).\nIn the nine years Applicant worked at the SCIF, he ran programs saved on disks\ncontaining lower-level classified information on higher-level systems between one and\ntwo hundred times (Tr. 179). He may have failed to write-protect the disks on two other\noccasions (Tr. 179).\nIn February 2004, an investigative agent subjected Applicant to three polygraph\nexaminations. In April 2004, the investigative agent interviewed Applicant. In June 2004,\nthe agency that conducted the investigation issued a clearance decision revoking\nApplicant\u2019s access to SCI (GE 3 at 25). \nAfter Applicant\u2019s access to SCI was revoked, his employer transferred him to\nanother facility. He continued to maintain a Top Secret clearance (Tr. 84). According to\nthe Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) of the facility where Applicant worked\nbetween 2004 and 2007:\nApplicant conducted himself in a professional and security conscious\nmanner. He was proactive in his security responsibilities and even helped\nto secure the proper marking of media, as required in a classified area (AE\nA at 13).\nSince losing his access to SCI in 2004, Applicant has received counseling\nregarding security procedures (GE 3 at 14). The current facility where he works is\ngoverned by \u201cvery very clear\u201d security procedures, unlike the facility where he worked\nbetween 1995 and 2004 (Tr. 160).\nOther than a 19-month period between March 2006 and October 2007, Applicant\nhas continuously held a security clearance since 1980.  He had only committed one\n3\nsecurity violation in the 15 years before he was assigned to the satellite facility in 1995\n(Tr. 116).\nAccording to a coworker who Applicant supervised between 2002 and 2004,\nApplicant displayed no irresponsibility in his attitude toward the discharge of his security\n\n7\nresponsibilities, even though the security rules at the SCIF often added additional work\n(AE A at Tab I). According to Applicant\u2019s supervisor from 1993 to 1996, Applicant\n\u201calways seemed security conscious . . . [and] maintained a positive attitude about\nsecurity\u201d (AE E at 10). Applicant\u2019s supervisor from 2001 through 2002 \u201cdirectly observed\nnothing but sheer dedication on [Applicant\u2019s] part regarding program security and\nfunctionality\u201d (GE 3 at 18). When Applicant sought a new position within the company in\n2007, his ex-supervisor \u201chad no hesitations in recommending him . . . given [his] past\ndealings with him\u201d (Id.).\nThe ISSO at Applicant\u2019s current assignment both testified and provided a\nreference letter. He has held this position since Applicant began working at the program\nin October 2007 (AE E at 9). Of the 40 to 50 people who work at the facility he\noversees, Applicant is the most diligent in adhering to security practices (Tr. 222). Also,\nthe ISSO noted the following:\n[Applicant] often has had to handle and create classified media in the form\nof CDs. He has played a key role in ensuring that this form of media is\nbeing properly tracked and secured in designated security containers . . .\n[Applicant] often has been responsible for opening and closing our\nclassified lab . . . During this time, [Applicant] has made it a point to be\nsecurity conscious and demonstrated his willingness to follow security\nguidelines (Id.).\nSince receiving the new assignment in 2007, Applicant has been proactive in\nclarifying ambiguous security procedures (Id.). For example, when tasked with an\nassignment that involved, among other things, the transfer of classified packages, he\nidentified an ambiguity regarding the company\u2019s procedures for transporting such\nmaterials, and did not begin the task until the company developed a more precise\nprocedure, which he helped to define and implement (Id.; Tr. 217).\nThe assistant ISSO (AISSO) also provided a reference letter (AE E at 11). His\nduties include \u201cfollow[ing] behind the people that work late to make sure the lab and\noffice areas are secure\u201d (Id.). He shared the following observations about Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity awareness:\nWhenever I\u2019ve come behind [Applicant] I have never seen anything out of\norder and he has even called me on occasion to clarify procedures when\nsomething in the lab fell into a gray area. Several of his questions have\ncaused me to add detail to my security briefing so everyone will know how\nto react to similar situations. (Id.).\nThe program\u2019s advisory engineer has often performed security monitoring of\napplicant\u2019s desk and local safe (Id. at 21). They have both always been properly\nsecured (Id.). \n\n8\nA licensed, clinical psychologist testified for Applicant (Tr. 182-200). The witness\nserved in the U.S. Army as a military psychologist from 1985 to 1991 (AE G at 3). Since\nleaving the Army, he has periodically served as a consultant as to the psychological\naspects of military-related issues such as administrative discharges, eligibility for\nspecialized schooling, and security clearances (Tr. 184; AE G at 2). He has provided\n\u201clow-intensity\u201d counseling to Applicant on a monthly basis since approximately 2006 (Tr.\n199). They discussed a number of issues including those leading to the revocation of\nApplicant\u2019s SCI in 2004. According to the psychologist, Applicant is now so sensitized to\nsecurity matters that \u201cwhen he would give [him] copies of awards that he had received .\n. . he would blacken out some of the names and some of the locations\u201d (Tr. 201). The\npsychologist had \u201cnever had this happen with any other candidate or subject\u201d with\nwhom he had worked (Tr. 200).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[d]eliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern\u201d (AG \u00b6 33). Applicant never\nknowingly concealed classified copies of e-mails in his pants pocket in order to\n\n9\ncircumvent security checkpoints upon exiting a classified facility, as the SOR alleged.\nNevertheless, the multiple episodes of mishandling classified and/or sensitive\ninformation over the years render the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 34\npotentially applicable:\n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or\nin any other unauthorized location;\n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise\nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved\nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or\ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \u2018palm\u2019\nor pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information.\nOver the years, Applicant negligently removed classified e-mail, and intentionally\nremoved unauthorized information from the SCIF. However, in these instances, he\nreturned the materials to the office the next day, and shredded them. Although\nApplicant\u2019s conduct represents a significant security concern, he had no intent to collect\nor store it at his home. AG \u00b6 34(b) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s negligent downloading of a classified file in 1995 and use of it to\nprepare an unclassified operations manual triggers the application of 34(c). All of\nApplicant\u2019s security violations trigger the application of 34(g).\nAG \u00b6 35 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions. They are as\nfollows:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so\ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training\nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security\nresponsibilities; and\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\nThe applicability of AG \u00b6 35(c) is predicated on an unintentional security breach.\nApplicant, however, knew that he was violating security regulations when he committed\nhis most significant security breach, the 1998 diskette-removal episode. Consequently,\nthe level of training he received before the security breach occurred is neither relevant\nnor mitigating. AG \u00b6 35(c) does not apply.\n\n10\nThree of Applicant\u2019s coworker\u2019s submitted affidavits supporting his assertion that\nthe SCIF where he worked from 1995 to 2004 was governed by unusual security rules\nthat, at times, impeded communication with their employer. This does not mitigate\nApplicant\u2019s history of circumventing security regulations. AG \u00b6 35(a), as it relates to\nunusual circumstances, is inapplicable. \nConversely, AG \u00b6 35(a), as it relates to the passage of time without recurrence,\nis applicable. Excluding a 19-month period between March 2006 and October 2007,\nApplicant has continued to work with classified information. He has not committed any\nsecurity violations since 2004. The ISSO at his current job assignment characterizes\nhim as one of the most security-conscious employees at their facility.\nApplicant completed remedial counseling regarding handling classified\ninformation. He is vigilantly committed to adhering to security regulations. His vigilance\nin identifying potential gaps and ambiguities in his company\u2019s security policies has led to\nthe revision of both its security briefings and policies. AG \u00b6 35(b) applies.\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 39 as follows:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information technology systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nIn 1997, Applicant deliberately obtained unauthorized access to a coworker\u2019s\ndesktop computer and downloaded an unclassified phone directory onto a floppy disk,\nthen copied it onto his desktop computer. Also, he negligently downloaded classified\ninformation in 1995, intentionally removed a classified diskette from a SCIF in 1998, and\nfailed to write-protect a diskette before inserting it onto an information system classified\nat a higher level in 2003. AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any information\ntechnology system or component thereof,\u201d and 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a\ngovernment or other information technology system,\u201d apply \nApplicant has not misused any information technology since 2004. Since then, he\nhas handled information technology in an exemplary manner. AG \u00b6 41(a), \u201cso much\ntime has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\n\n11\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(1) \u201cuntrustworthy or\nunreliable behavior . . .,\u201d and 16(d)3), \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d The\napplicability of these disqualifying conditions is predicated on Applicant\u2019s conduct not\nbeing \u201cexplicitly covered under any other guideline\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(d)). Applicant\u2019s conduct is\ncovered under both Guidelines M, Use of Information Technology Systems (AG \u00b6\u00b6 39-\n41), and K, Handling Protected Information, (AG \u00b6\u00b6 33-35), rendering their discussion\nunder these particular disqualifying conditions superfluous. The mitigating conditions set\nforth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and 17(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d apply for the reasons discussed in the previous sections.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct reflected a tendency to elevate expedience over security\nconsciousness when performing his tasks. Particularly troubling was the intentional and\nsurreptitious nature of some of his misconduct. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s security\nviolations and misuse of information technology generate significant security concerns.\nApplicant has not committed any security violations or engaged in any episodes\nof information systems misuse in more than five years. The remoteness of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct alone, however, is not mitigating, given the seriousness of the conduct.\n\n12\nSince 2004, Applicant has not only avoided committing any additional security\nviolations; he has attended remedial security counseling and demonstrated an\nenthusiastic, vigilant attitude toward the discharge of his security responsibilities.\nSpecifically, he assisted in the revision of company security policy to eliminate gaps and\nambiguities that he had identified. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s vigilance has led to an\nimproved security posture of an entire division within his company. \nApplicant has worked for his employer for nearly 30 years. He has maintained a\nsecurity clearance for nearly his entire tenure at the company. He is well respected by\nhis coworkers. One coworker, who supervised him between 2001 and 2002,\ncomplimented his dedication to security awareness, which Applicant demonstrated while\nworking for him, and strongly endorsed his application to maintain his security\nclearance. \nAs the psychologist who counseled Applicant noted, he is now extraordinarily\nsensitized to security matters. Under these circumstances, the seriousness of the\nconduct is outweighed by the presence of rehabilitation and the minimal likelihood of\nrecurrence. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.e. and 2.a. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., and 2.b.~2.e. of the SOR. Guideline B - Foreign Influence The Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1940, but came to the United States in 1964 to further his education (TR at page 58 lines 7~9, and GX 1 at pages 1 and 2). 1.c. From 1961~1962, the Applicant served as a Second Lieutenant in the Taiwanese Army (TR at page 113 line 13 to page 114 line 14). During this mandatory service, the Applicant did not receive a Taiwanese security clearance (Id). The Applicant received a Master\u2019s Degree in 1966; and a Ph.D. in 1971, both degrees are from American universities (GX 1 at page 2). In 1973, he was naturalized as an American (TR at page 58 lines 4~10, and GX 1 at page 1). He also held a security clearance from 1973 to 2002, nearly 30 years (TR at page 67 lines 4~14). The Applicant has two brothers, both of whom are U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. (TR at page 99 line 1 to page 100 line 2, and GX 1 at page 5). He also has three sisters, two of whom are U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. (TR at page 100 lines 9~25, at page 102 line 24 to page 103 line 19, and GX 1 at page 5). The Applicant has substantial assets in the U.S., and none in Taiwan (TR at page 127 line 15 to page 131 line 13, and AppXs E~J). He owns a home, free and clear, worth between $1,500,000 and $1",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert Bohn, Esquire\nNovember 12, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP), on\nJanuary 14, 2008.  On April 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and E for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 1, 2009.  He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on May 15, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on May 18, 2009, and I received the\ncase assignment on July 13, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay \u201cuntil the\nweek of August 17, 2009,\u201d in order for his counsel to be available.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 17, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n\n2\n19, 2009.  By way of stipulation, the Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6,\nand the Applicant offered Exhibits (AppXs) A through Q; all of which were received into\nevidence.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on August 27, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Taiwan.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a.~1.e. and 2.a. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the factual allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., and 2.b.~2.e. of the SOR.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1940, but came to the United States in 1964\nto further his education (TR at page 58 lines 7~9, and GX 1 at pages 1 and 2).\n1.c.  From 1961~1962, the Applicant served as a Second Lieutenant in the\nTaiwanese Army (TR at page 113 line 13 to page 114 line 14).  During this mandatory\nservice, the Applicant did not receive a Taiwanese security clearance (Id).\nThe Applicant received a Master\u2019s Degree in 1966; and a Ph.D. in 1971, both\ndegrees are from American universities (GX 1 at page 2).  In 1973, he was naturalized\nas an American (TR at page 58 lines 4~10, and GX 1 at page 1).  He also held a\nsecurity clearance from 1973 to 2002, nearly 30 years (TR at page 67 lines 4~14).\nThe Applicant has two brothers, both of whom are U.S. citizens and reside in the\nU.S. (TR at page 99 line 1 to page 100 line 2, and GX 1 at page 5).  He also has three\nsisters, two of whom are U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. (TR at page 100 lines\n9~25, at page 102 line 24 to page 103 line 19, and GX 1 at page 5).\nThe Applicant has substantial assets in the U.S., and none in Taiwan (TR at\npage 127 line 15 to page 131 line 13, and AppXs E~J).  He owns a home, free and\nclear, worth between $1,500,000 and $1,700,000 (TR at page 128 line 20 to page 129\nline 3, and AppX E).  He also owns income property worth more than $1,000,000 (TR at\npage 129 line 14 to page 13 line 3, and AppX F).  The Applicant has over $28,000 in\n\n3\ntwo checking accounts (TR at page 130 lines 4~11, at page 130 line 25 to page 131 line\n13, AppX G, and AppX J at page 3).\n1.a.  The Applicant has one sister who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan (TR at\npage 101 line 1 to page 102 line 20, and GX 1 at page 5).  She was a permanent\nresident of the U.S. from 1983 to 1990, but moved back to Taiwan to care for their, now\ndeceased, mother (TR at page 101 line 1 to page 102 line 20).  She is a retired\naccountant, who comes to the U.S. to visit the Applicant \u201cabout once a year\u201d (Id).\nThe Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen of Taiwan, but is a permanent resident of\nthe U.S. (TR at page 107 line 3 to page 106 line 17).  He sees this sister-in-law \u201ca\ncouple of times a year,\u201d . . . \u201cwhen she comes to visit with . . . [her] children,\u201d who are\nAmerican citizens (Id).\nNeither the Applicant\u2019s sister nor his sister-in-law work for the Taiwanese\ngovernment (TR at page 107 lines 3~11).  They do not know the specifics of what the\nApplicant does for his employer, and the Applicant would not be subject to coercion or\nexploitation vis-a-vis these Taiwanese relatives (Id, and TR at page 131 line 14 to page\n132 line 12).\n1.b.  The Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 1977, twice in 1990, twice in 1997, and\nthe last time in 2000 (TR at page 107 line 24 to page 113 line 12, and GX 1 at pages 6\nand 9).  In 1977, he traveled to Taiwan \u201cto pay respects to . . . [his] father-in-law,\u201d who\nhad died \u201cthe year before\u201d (TR at page 107 line 24 to page 108 line 9).  In 1990, he\ntraveled to Taiwan the first time to visit his sick mother, and the second time \u201cto attend\nher funeral\u201d (TR at page 108 lines 10~15).  In 1997, he traveled to Taiwan the first time\nto attend his \u201coldest brother\u2019s funeral;\u201d and the second time, at the behest of his\nAmerican employer to seek business with the Taiwanese government (TR at page 109\nlines 3~25).  This second business trip was unsuccessful (Id).\n1.d.  In the early 1990's, the Applicant, along with others, was invited to review a\nTaiwan economic five year plan (TR at page 114 line 15 to page 116 line 21).  This\nreview was to be conducted in the U.S., at the behest of a private group, but it was held\nat the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECO) (Id).  However, once\nthe Applicant was informed that the reviewers\u2019 comments would be published not only in\nthe U.S., but also in Taiwan, he quit as one of the reviewers, as he did not \u201cwant to have\nany connection with the Taiwanese\u201d government (TR at page 114 line 15 to page 116\nline 21). \n1.b., 1.e., 1.g. and 2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s last trip to Taiwan was in 2000 (TR at\npage 110 line 17 to page 113 line 12).  He attended a conference for community leaders\nof overseas Chinese (TR at page 116 line 22 to page 118 line 3).  He went in his private\ncapacity, as a member of the Chinese-American professional association, and as a\nmember of a scholastic society (TR at page 120 line 21 to page 124 line 20).  His\nmanager at work knew of his attendance, and \u201cthought it an honor to be invited\u201d (TR at\n112 line 7 to page 113 line 1).\n\n4\nThe Applicant sat in an audience with other overseas Chinese (TR at page 140\nline 8 to page 142 line 10, and at page 161 line 13 to page 162 line 25).  He described\nthe conference in the following terms: \u201cwe are on the receiving side.  Receiving\ninformation.  So I don\u2019t even talk to [the] presenter\u201d (TR at page 161 line 13 to page 162\nline 25).  However, he did receive reimbursement for airfare, and free room and board\n(TR at page 116 line 22 to page 118 line 3, and at page 144 line 12 to page 146 line\n10).  He did not report these gratuities to his employer, however, his Manager knew of\nthe trip to Taiwan and its purpose (Id).  The Applicant attended this 2000 conference in\nhis private capacity as a member of both the professional association and of the\nscholastic society, and the Government has not established that the Applicant had any\naffirmative obligation to report any gratuities received during this private trip to Taiwan.\n1.f. and 2.d.  In 2002, a secretary from TECO called the Applicant inquiring as to\nthe marital status of one of his fellow employees (TR at page 118 line 4 to page 120 line\n20).  The daughter of \u201csomeone important in Taiwan\u201d wished to marry this employee,\nand they were inquiring if he was, in fact, single (Id).  The Applicant confirmed that his\nfellow employee was single (TR at page 118 line 4 to page 120 line 20).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.b.  It is alleged that the Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended in 2003\nfor providing a false statement to a Federal agent.  The Applicant has consistently and\nrepeatedly denied this allegation, and the Government has failed to establish that the\nApplicant provided any such false statement (TR at page 29 line 16 to page 34 line 3, at\npage 74 line 4 to page 75 line 10, and at page 86 line 20 to page 88 line 14).\n2.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant failed to fully disclose all of his \u201cinteractions\nwith AFOSI and FBI agents in 2002 [and] to an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense when interviewed.\u201d  The investigator testified as a Government\nwitness at the Applicant\u2019s, and testified to the contrary; i.e. that the Applicant was fully\ncooperative and told her what he knew of those \u201cinteractions\u201d (TR at page 38 line 9 to\npage 54 line 15, see also TR at page 88 line 18 to page 89 line 1).\n2.e.  In answer to question \u201c17 YOUR FOREIGN ACTIVITIES\u201d on his January\n2008 QNSP, the Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d that he had not had \u201cany contact with a\nforeign government . . . or its representatives . . . .\u201d (GX 1 at page 6).  The Applicant\nanswered this posited question by using his employer\u2019s security manual as a guide\n(AppX K).  That guide states the following:\n4. Contact with Foreign Nationals must be reported to Security when the\nfollowing occur:\n4.1. An effort by an individual, regardless of nationality, to obtain illegal or\nunauthorized access to classified or sensitive unclassified material, or to\ncompromise an employee.\n\n5\n4.2. Employee contact with known or suspected intelligence officers from\nany country.\n4.3. Attempted exploitation of an employee by the intelligence services of\nanother country (AppX K at page 1, and TR at page 124 line 22 to page\n126 line 17).\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and comments, namely his abandoned review of Taiwan\u2019s\nfive year development plan, in the early 1990's, does not come within the purview of his\nemployer\u2019s guide.  His sitting in an audience of overseas Chinese in Taiwan in 2000;\nand listening to presenters, also does not come within the purview of his employer\u2019s\nguide.  Finally, his giving the marital status of a fellow employee to a secretary from\nTECO does not come within the purview of his employer\u2019s guide (TR at page 152 line\n14 to page 153 line 25, and at page 161 line 13 to page 162 line 25).  I find no willful\nfalsification here.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Taiwan has an elected\ndemocratic government.  It has the 17  largest economy in the world and is a leading\nth\nproducer of high-technology goods.  It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and business.  Although the\nU.S. now recognizes Taiwan as part of \u201cone-China,\u201d it continues to maintain strong\nunofficial relations with Taiwan.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a\nforeign interest.\u201d\nHere, Subparagraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . .\n. who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  His sister-in-law is also a citizen of\nTaiwan.  This is countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . .\n. are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s sister, a retired accountant, has no connection with the Taiwanese\ngovernment.  His Taiwanese sister-in-law lives in the U.S. with her American children,\nand also has no connection with the Taiwanese government.\nSubparagraph 7(b) is arguably also applicable: \u201cconnections to a foreign person .\n. . . create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  This is clearly countered by the second\nmitigating condition, as \u201cthere is no conflict of interest.  Either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest.\u201d  The vast majority of the Applicant\u2019s family, and all of his wealth are in\nthe U.S.  He has worked for a defense contractor for more than 35 years with glowing\nreviews, which will be discussed more under the Whole Person Concept, below.  He\nhas absolutely no incentive to help Taiwan or any other foreign government.  In the\nearly 1990's, he quit as one of the reviewers of Taiwan\u2019s five year economic plan.  In\n2000, he attended a conference for community leaders of overseas Chinese, in his\nprivate capacity.  He merely sat in an audience, and had little, if any, contact with any\nTaiwanese representative.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nParagraph 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nIf find no Disqualifying Condition applicable here, as the Applicant answered\nquestion 17 on his January 2008 QNSP to the best of his knowledge and belief.  He\nused his employer\u2019s security manual as a guide, and answered the posited question\naccordingly.  There is no wilful falsification.\nThe second Disqualifying Condition is also not applicable, as he fully cooperated\nwith the Government\u2019s investigators, as testified to by one of its investigators.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept.\n\n8\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThose who work with the Applicant have only glowing comments as to his\ncharacter (AppX A~C, and Q).  A Principal Director at his employer avers, in part, the\nfollowing:\n6. I have known . . . [the Applicant] since he first started with . . . [his\nemployer] in 1973.  Since then, we have worked together as colleagues,\nand I have been his supervisor. . . .  8. [The Applicant] is a hard and\ndedicated worker.  I found him to be open, honest, trustworthy and\nreliable.  9. I believe that he is conscientious and consistently follows all\ncompany rules and procedures, including those that relate to the\nprotection of sensitive information. . . .  12. Based on the foregoing, and\nmy knowledge of and interactions with . . . [the Applicant], I support . . .\n[the Applicant\u2019s] security clearance candidacy (AppX Q).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from his alleged Foreign Influence and Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 18,\n2006. On December 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on March 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 8, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 6, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through K. The record was kept open until\nMay 15, 2008. Applicant timely submitted documents that are marked AE L through P.\nMay 20, 2008\n\n2\nDepartment counsel had no objection to the post hearing submissions. The record\nclosed on May 16, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 15,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated February 20, 2008 Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.o of the SOR. Applicant provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant graduated\nfrom high school in 1989 and received her undergraduate paralegal degree in 1992 (Tr.\n33). Recently, she also earned a U.S. export compliance officer certification. \nApplicant is single, and has no children. She was employed as a paralegal and\nworked for various law firms from 1992 until 2000. She began working for a nonprofit\norganization in 2001. She had no health insurance and received a low salary\n(approximately $13,000 a year) when she was employed with the nonprofit organization.\n(Tr. 37) She has had many medical problems. As a result, she incurred many medical\nbills (GE 3).\nApplicant did not receive a W-2 form for her wages. She was given a 1099 form\n(Tr. 37). Applicant did not make estimated tax payments. She accumulated debt to the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for her unpaid taxes for the tax year 2001 in the amount\nof $2,356.46 (interest/penalty). For tax year 2002, Applicant owed approximately\n$6,873.95 (interest/penalty) for unpaid taxes. Finally, for tax year 2003, Applicant owed\n$6,504.73 (interest/penalty) for unpaid taxes (GE 4).\nThe IRS notified Applicant in 2003-2004 concerning her unpaid taxes for the\nyears noted above. Applicant was deemed uncollectible at some point due to her low\nsalary (Tr. 45).  \nApplicant has had health problems for at least fifteen years. Initially, she had a\nproblem with her kidney. When she was finally diagnosed with kidney stones in 2001,\nshe became very ill. She lost 80 pounds. Due to her medical problems, she could not\nwork for a period of time in 2001-2002 (Tr.) 34. She had surgery in 2002 (Tr. 40).\nIn 2003, Applicant suffered from endometriosis. She had two different surgeries.\nAt one point in time, she was out of work for six weeks. Applicant\u2019s consistent health\ninsurance coverage started in September 2004 (Tr. 43). She is now healthy and working\nfull time in a steady position. However, she has approximately $14,800 in medical bills.\nApplicant has been employed in her current position since January 2006. She is\nwell regarded by her colleagues. She is making more money than she ever did before\nthis employment. Her supervisor commends her for her flawless personal integrity,\n\nThe IRS sent Applicant a letter on May 5, 2008 advising her that they applied an overpayment ($572.14) from\n1\nher 2001 tax return to the unpaid balance of the other federal taxes she owed (AE J).\n3\ntrustworthiness and hard-working dedication to the company mission. She has maturity,\ngood judgment, diligence in her work and intelligence (AE A-C). Applicant\u2019s manger\ntestified at the hearing as to her punctuality, diligence, and thoroughness in her work.\nApplicant handles the sensitive material for the company with no problems (Tr. 69). She\nrecommends Applicant highly and without reservation for a security clearance. \nApplicant is proud and happy to serve in this position. She loves her country and\nbelieves she is making a contribution to her country. She loves what she does and\nunderstands that her employer has total confidence in her (GE 4).\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are for the unpaid federal taxes with interest/penalties.\nApplicant owed $2,356.46 for tax year 2001. For tax year 2002, she owed $6,873.95\nThe IRS released the liens for the tax years 2001 and 2002 after Applicant paid $12,600\nto the IRS in March 2008 (AE D-E). She did not have to take out a loan to pay the taxes.\nThus, she avoided getting into more debt. Instead, her parents gave her the money to\npay the taxes and she does not have to pay them back. Applicant requested the IRS to\nreduce the penalties and interest on her taxes. They explained that would not be\npossible (AE G-H). Applicant appealed the decision. The IRS granted the request and\nexplained to Applicant that this is a one-time consideration. Applicant is waiting to\nreceive a notice of penalty adjustment. That amount will be applied to the unpaid tax for\ntax year 2003 (allegation 1.c). Applicant estimates that the remaining amount will be\n$2,000 to $3,000.  She will pay that and then receive a certificate of release for tax year\n1\n2003 (Tr. 54).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a medical bill for $125; 1.e is a medical bill for $295; 1.f is a medical\nbill for $125; 1.g is a medical bill for $314; 1.h is for a hospital bill for $961; 1.i is a\nmedical bill for $666; 1.j is a hospital bill for $9,608. SOR 1 l is another medical bill for\n$2,130; 1.o is a medical bill for $535. These are not paid. Applicant has received\nfinancial counseling and is in the process of contacting the outstanding debtors to obtain\na billing statement and begin a repayment plan (AE O).\nSOR 1.k is a phone bill for $101. Applicant paid this right after the hearing and\nsubmitted documentation (AE N). Applicant also paid two more bills after the hearing\nand submitted documentation for proof of payment for SOR \u00b6 1.m ($50) and SOR \u00b6 1.n\n($50). \nAt the hearing Applicant explained her plan to resolve her medical bills and debt.\nShe will pay the smaller bills first. \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $2,770. After monthly\ndeductions and expenses of $1,300, she pays on her student loan, and current medical\nbills. Applicant then has a net remainder of $235 a month (AE K). She has a budget.\nShe owns her vehicle (Tr. 63).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant had unpaid taxes for years 2001-2003. She also has\ndelinquent medical debts that total about $14,800. She has not been able to pay them\nfor a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries partially arose due to her illness, underemployment and lack of health\ninsurance. She is now earning a steady, full time income. The Applicant\u2019s problems\nhave been ongoing, but she is now resolving them. Her medical situation has improved.\nThis potentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose from her lower earnings, lack of health insurance, ill health and\nmedical bills. She acted responsibly by working and living modestly during her\nunderemployment. However, she did not pay the IRS taxes for three years. I find this\npotentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has started financial counseling recently. She has\n\n6\npaid her taxes to the IRS for the years 2001-2002. She is awaiting a final amount for the\n2003 tax year. She has a plan to pay her debts. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply in part.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, this does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a hardworking single\nperson. She had health problems which sometimes impeded her ability to work.\nApplicant also had a period of underemployment and no health insurance that made it\ndifficult for her to pay all her medical bills. She has finally found a good paying position.\nShe has never made the income that she is making now. Her employer recommends\nher highly. Her colleagues believe she is a great asset to the company. She has\nstruggled financially for a long period of time. She does not live beyond her means. She\ntakes pride in her job and is described as trustworthy. Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all her debts are paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout her fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant has a plan to address her\ndelinquent medical debts. She has met her burden of proof in this case to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations.\n \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns arising under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nOn October 12, 2007, Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR. On\nNovember 20, 2007, he submitted his notarized Answer to the SOR, admitted the five\nallegations raised in the SOR, and declined to have a hearing. A March 13, 2008, File\nof Relevant Material (FORM), including seven documents, was submitted by the\nGovernment.

Based\nupon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant met his burden of\nmitigating security concerns arising under Guideline B. Security clearance is granted.\nProcedural Matters\nThe Government moved administrative notice be taken with regards to certain\nitems contained in its FORM regarding Vietnam. Administrative notice is hereby taken:\nVietnam, formally the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is \u201can authoritarian state ruled by\nthe Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).\u201d  It often works with China, its largest trading\n1\npartner. U.S.-Vietnam relations \u201chave gradually been normalizing\u201d since the 1990s,\nalthough tensions remain regarding human rights issues.  Arbitrary detentions,\n2\nparticularly with regard to political activities, remain a problem. Three Americans were\narrested in Vietnam in 2005 while visiting relatives and charged with plotting violence\nagainst the Vietnamese government.  Police sometimes mistreat those under arrest or\n3\nin custody and arbitrary detentions remain a problem. Freedom of speech and of the\npress is restricted, particularly with regard to the Internet and cyber-dissidents.  It is not\n4\nunusual for Vietnamese citizens to be monitored and visitors may be put under\nsurveillance. Timely notice to the U.S. of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Vietnam is\nrare and access to such detainees can be difficult, particularly if they are former citizens\nof Vietnam. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old engineer currently employed by a defense contractor.\nHe was born in Vietnam to an upper middle class family. Opposed to the encroaching\nCommunist presence in the country, his family moved south when Vietnam was divided.\nThere, his father rose to the rank of Vice-Chief of Police in a major city. His mother ran\na business supporting the United States (U.S.) Forces by providing them with fresh\nproduce. When Communist forces took Vietnam in 1975, Applicant\u2019s father arranged for\nthe family to flee the country on a U.S. helicopter. The family arrived in the US., which\nthey now call their \u201cbeloved country.\u201d  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\n5\nApril 1982. In 1984, he completed his academic studies and received a Bachelor of\nScience degree in engineering. He purposefully selected his academic major to prepare\nhimself for employment within the defense industry.

After their 2002 divorce, Applicant\ndecided to visit Vietnam. He had visited it once before, in 2000, and wished to see more\nof the country. He advised his employer of his desire to travel to Vietnam and attended\na briefing.  He solicited travel information from Internet sources in around October\n8\n2002. One of those individuals was a female with whom he became a pen pal. \nDuring his two week trip to Vietnam in January 2003, Applicant met his pen pal.\nShe was a physician working for a national entity. Her parents, now in their 70s, were\nformer high school educators and both citizens and residents of Vietnam. Her siblings\nare similarly citizens and residents of Vietnam, each college educated and currently in a\nlucrative career. The woman also has a son from a prior marriage, born in 1994. When\nshe sued her ex-husband for divorce in 2001, she relinquished custody in the boy and\nagreed to pay her ex-husband approximately $20 U.S. dollars a month for \u201cchild\nalimony.\u201d  Their relationship is not overtly close and contact is sporadic, consisting of an\n9\noccasional phone call or holiday gift.  Applicant has never met the son.\n10\nAfter his trip, Applicant reported his activities to his employer. They continued to\ncorrespond. A return trip was planned and his employer was notified. It was taken in the\nsummer of 2003. Upon his return, Applicant reported his trip and his engagement to the\nwoman to his security officer. In 2004, Applicant\u2019s fiancee immigrated to the U.S.,\nmarried Applicant, and applied for U.S. citizenship. On December 28, 2007, she\nbecame a naturalized citizen. Applicant describes his relationship with his in-laws as\n\u201cgood\u201d without elaboration  They do not discuss his work and are unaware of his\n11\nsecurity clearance. His in-laws are content in Vietnam, but hope to visit the U.S. Neither\nApplicant nor his wife has returned to Vietnam or seen her family since her 2004\nemigration.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Aug. 10, 1995).\n    12\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    13\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    14\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of\n12\nevidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision\n13\nis on an applicant.  \n14\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id.\n    15\n Id.\n    16\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    17\n The Government similarly urges application of AG \u00b6 7i (conduct, especially while traveling outside the\n    18\nU.S., which may make individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment or country). The facts, however, fail to detail any particular conduct on the part of Applicant which,\nbased on the Government\u2019s submissions for administrative notice regarding the country at issue,  may have\nmade him vulnerable. There is no indication, for example, that he was involved in any political activities or anti-\n5\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n15\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n16\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n17\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find that GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN\nINFLUENCE is most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case. The concern\nunder that adjudicative guideline is that foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in\na way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\nset forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife immigrated to the U.S., she left behind her son, parents,\nand siblings, all of whom are residents and citizens of Vietnam. Personal contact is\nimpossible due to distance, but other forms of contact have been made. This fact raises\nconcerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7a (contact\nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), AG \u00b6\n7b (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information), and AG \u00b6 7d (sharing living quarters with a\nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).  With\n18\n\nCPV activity. They only note he visited Vietnam as a tourist and courted his current wife. \n6\ndisqualifying conditions thus raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security\nconcerns.\nAs a threshold matter, the issue regarding Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s Vietnamese\ncitizenship has been made constructively moot by her intervening oath of U.S.\ncitizenship. Moreover, his unrebutted testimony regarding his trips to Vietnam depict\npleasure holidays. It does not suggest any of the political activities or motives\nassociated with those types of conduct depicted as provoking scrutiny or action in the\nmaterials administratively noted, nor is it argued that Applicant was in any way politically\nactive in his trips. Consequently, central focus is thus aimed at the remaining\nallegations.\nAlthough Applicant provided considerable written testimony with regard to his\ncourtship, his travel, and his family, fewer facts are provided regarding his step-son and\nin-laws. With regard to his step-son, however, Applicant established that he has never\nmet the child. Although the bond between mother and child is generally presumed to be\ndeep and intimate, the facts here are atypical. His wife petitioned for divorce from her\nfirst husband and voluntarily relinquished custody of the child to her ex-husband, to\nwhom she pays a negligible amount of money for the child\u2019s welfare. Her own contact\nwith the child is irregular and nominal. When contact is made through the mail or by\ntelephone it is fleeting, and apparently lacks intimacy. Consequently, Foreign Influence\nMitigating Condition (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8c (contact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) applies with regard to the minor step-child.\nFew facts are presented regarding Applicant\u2019s in-laws. Although his parents-in-\nlaw are retired, it cannot be determined whether they are retired from a state or a\nprivate high school, nor can it be determined whether they are dependent on a state\npension. Similarly, although it has been shown his wife\u2019s siblings are educated\nprofessionals, it is unclear at to whether they or their professions bare any nexus with\nthe government of Vietnam or the CPV. No facts are given depicting the relationship\nbetween his wife and her family, although it is known neither Applicant nor his wife has\nphysically seen her family since she moved to the U.S. Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween Applicant and his in-laws is flatly summarized as being \u201cgood,\u201d with no\nparticular intimation of intimacy. With regard to the relationship between his wife and\nher parents, there is no description of whether her relationship with them is any deeper\nor more frequently maintained than the relationship she has with her son.\nConsequently, neither AG \u00b6 8a (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) nor AG \u00b6 8c (contact or\n\n FI MC AG \u00b6 8d and \u00b6 8f are not applicable.\n    19\n This is particularly true given the FORM\u2019s representation of the types of potential human rights threats\n    20\nVietnam might pose, which does not include evidence that Vietnam actively seeks to inveigle industrial secrets\nfrom U.S. citizens through their kin remaining in Vietnam or is otherwise linked to terrorism.  See AG \u00b6 6.\n7\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) applies.  \n19\nThe facts show, however, that Applicant properly apprised his employer with\nfacts regarding his travel to Vietnam and his growing relationship with his new wife.\nNeither the SOR nor the record indicate he ever failed to comply with any controlling\nreporting requirements. Therefore, FI MC AG \u00b6 8e (the individual has promptly complied\nwith existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or\nthreats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country). \nFurthermore, the facts squarely demonstrate that Applicant and his immediate\nfamily are predisposed to the American way of life and have both a deeply rooted\nallegiance to the U.S. and an antipathy for its enemies that predates their immigration:\nThe family was relatively affluent and fled to South Vietnam en masse when the country\nwas divided. There, his father worked to maintain law and order while his mother\nworked to support U.S. operations in that region. The family fled Vietnam in 1975\nthrough assistance received from the U.S. The family then immigrated to the U.S. and\nsettled. In college, Applicant prepared himself for a career that would help him\ncontribute to U.S. national security. He has worked extensively and successfully in that\narea for nearly 25 years. His written testimony reflects that he relishes his U.S.\ncitizenship, his life in his \u201cbeloved country,\u201d and his ability to help protect this country.\nSuch unwavering devotion is notable. The facts give rise to FI MC AG \u00b6 8b (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest).20\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\n\n8\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. I particularly note that Applicant successfully raised FI MC AG\u00b6 8b\nand \u00b6 8e. Applicant is an immigrant who speaks of this country in reverent terms. He is\na mature man who has proven himself to be goal-oriented and devoted to serving this\ncountry as best he can. An engineer/scientist who has devoted his professional life to\nthe U.S. defense industry and possesses 25 years of experience working with protected\ninformation, there is no question with regard to his affinity for and loyalty to the U.S.\nMoreover, while inadequate facts were raised to gauge his wife\u2019s long-distance\nrelationship with her family or determine whether Applicant has any genuine allegiance\nto his in-laws, there are no facts indicating his affinity for these people is as strong as\nhis demonstrated allegiance to his adopted country. Further, while the Government\u2019s\nmaterials depict unresolved human rights issues in Vietnam, particularly with regard to\nactive dissidents, there is no evidence that country endeavors to gather or extort secret\ninformation through American kin residing in Vietnam or otherwise targets Americans\non simple pleasure holidays. These facts, taken together with the mitigating conditions\nraised, and after consideration of Applicant as a whole, lead me to conclude that the\nsecurity concerns raised have been mitigated and that it is in the national interest to\ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Security clearance is granted.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

When completing his clearance application in 2002, he\nhad answered \u201cyes\u201d to the drug question, and had disclosed marijuana use in high\nschool\u2014use which he was told was beyond the scope of the question. He was aware of\nthe three delinquent debts, but felt justified in omitting them because he had reasons for\nthinking each of them unjust. He attributed his one-time marijuana use to being with old\nfriends, with whom he felt comfortable, and joining them when the marijuana was\noffered. He does not intend to use marijuana again.\nIn March 2004, Applicant was fired from his job as a background investigator for\na government contractor for falsifying two investigative reports. The two reports involved\nemployees with temporary appointments (i.e., with expiration dates). In each case,\nApplicant noted the temporary appointment, but did not record the expiration date of the\nappointment. He recalls having done so previously without comment, but in this\ninstance, his temporary supervisor returned the reports to him and directed him to\nobtain the correct information. Applicant concluded that the information was not worth\nthe effort of traveling to the records location, so polled his coworkers about the typical\nlength of a temporary appointment, and made up dates for the two reports. The\ncompany considered this to be falsification, and he was fired. Applicant did not contest\nthe firing. \n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n4\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n3\nApplicant\u2019s character references (A.E. A) and employment references (A.E. B),\nconsider him worthy for access to classified information. None appear aware of the\nissues raised in the SOR.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal\ndrug use and his financial issues from the government.  He did so knowing that these\n4\n\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ; (c) any illegal drug use\n5\nafter being granted a security clearance; \n6\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n7\nof abstinence;\n4\nissues were of security concern to the government. Further, his falsification of the\ninvestigative reports\u2014and more pertinently, his willingness to substitute his own\njudgment about what level of effort was required\u2014casts serious doubt on his judgment.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the\ngovernment from evaluating his illegal drug use and financial issues in a timely fashion.\nFinally, while his eventual disclosures may have been forthright, they cannot be\nconsidered prompt.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use and financial issues\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be\nprudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information\nabout himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline H.5\nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. His one-time use in March 2004 is\nboth distant in time and infrequent.  His abstinence from drug use\u2014now nearly four\n6\nyears\u2014is adequate to demonstrate an intent to refrain from drug use in the future.  I\n7\nconclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline H for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGeorge G. Boyd, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 14, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On July 24, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s material findings are\nbased on substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under\nGuideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n \n(1) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in estimating the amount of Applicant\u2019s monthly\nexpenses in 2003 and 2004.  Applicant\u2019s assertion in this regard does not demonstrate harmful error.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences\nthat could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change\nthe outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s\nmitigating evidence.  That evidence indicated that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due in part\nto loss of employment and a medical emergency, and that Applicant had been unable to resolve his\noutstanding debts because he had occupied low-paying jobs since his return to employment.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had substantial delinquent debts.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  A review of\nthe record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant conditions and factors.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\n\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its action to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 25, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 11, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing.\nOn March 21, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nconsisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to\nJuly 24, 2008\n\nApplicant indicated in the employment section of his e-QIP (Item 1) two breaks in his employment record,\n1\nfrom June 2003 to February 2004 and from March 2006 to June 2006, neither of which coincide with a claimed\njob layoff in September 2005.\n2\nApplicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.

On June 24, 2008, the case was assigned to me\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for him. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4), eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleges under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent credit card debt totaling $116,865 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). Applicant\nadmitted the debts in his Answer (Item 4). After considering the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old client-server analyst who has worked for a defense\ncontractor on a U.S. military installation, most recently since June 2006. He had\npreviously worked for the company as a computer technical support analyst associate\nfor about three months, from January to March 2006.

He was then unemployed for about seven months before\ngoing to work as a field service representative for a commercial company in February\n2004. According to his e-QIP, he came to the military base in September 2005, as a\nhelp desk analyst. In January 2006, he started working for his current employer, but\nfound himself again unemployed in March 2006. In June 2006, he returned to work for\nthe company, this time as a client-server analyst (Item 1).\nApplicant completed his e-QIP in application for a security clearance on July 25,\n2006. He responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over\n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and to question 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?.\u201d He disclosed that he was past due on several credit\ncard accounts because of major surgery in fall 2004 which depleted his savings, and a\njob layoff in September 2005.  Applicant listed five delinquent credit card accounts\n1\n\nSOR \u00b61.a and \u00b6 1.b appear to be the same debt. Applicant\u2019s January 2008 credit report (Item 5) indicates\n2\nthat an account opened with the creditor in \u00b6 1.a was transferred or sold. The account number and the high\ncredit of $12,869 which appear under the name of the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a on his June 2007 credit report\n(Item 6) correspond to the account number and high credit for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b on the January 2008\ncredit report.\nHis e-QIP shows no break in employment at that time. Presumably, he was out of work on some type of\n3\nunpaid sick or disability leave. \n3\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u20131.f), which had an aggregate balance of $98,934.92. He expressed his\n2\nintention to make repayment arrangements (Item 1).\nOn February 26, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his financial issues and the reasons for the debt. Applicant explained that he was\nlaid off from June 2003 until February 2004. While he began working for a commercial\ncompany, he broke his hip that fall and was unable to work and without benefits for\nthree months following surgery.  He depleted his savings and 401(k) accounts, and\n3\nrelied on consumer credit to pay his living expenses. He kept his monthly obligations\ncurrent with the exception of some credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u2013same as \u00b6 1.b,\n1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f), which he acknowledged had not been satisfied. He indicated that\nhe had contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f in 2005, and was given a grace period of four\nmonths. It was referred for collection in January 2006. He admitted he had not\ncontacted the other creditors. Applicant expressed his intent to contact all his creditors\nby the end of 2007 to arrange for repayment. Based on income, expense, and debt\npayment figures he provided, Applicant reported a net monthly remainder of $454 (Item\n8).\nA history of his delinquent accounts is reflected in the following table (Items 1, 5,\n6, 7).\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\n\u00b6 1.a $12,869 charge off \nRevolving charge opened\nAug 95, $12,869 past due\nbalance charged off, debt\ntransferred Sep 05 (see \u00b6\n1.b)\nNo payments since Aug 05\n\u00b6 1.b $14,159 collection\ndebt\n$12,869 debt balance as\nof Sep 05, referred for\ncollection, $14,159\nbalance as of Dec 07\n(See SOR \u00b6 1.a)\n\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\n4\n\u00b6 1.c $30,180 charge off\nRevolving charge opened\nJan 99, last activity Oct 05,\n$26,700 credit limit,\nbalance $30,180 as of Dec\n07\nNo payments since Aug 05\n\u00b6 1.d $20,330 charge off\nRevolving charge opened\nNov 2001,$18,000 high\ncredit, transferred Oct 05,\n$19,742.07 balance as of\nJun 06\nNo payments since Aug\n05, admits $20,330 owed\n\u00b6 1.e $35,275 collection\ndebt\nRevolving charge with\n$32,316 high credit, for\ncollection Nov 05, $35,275\nbalance as of Nov 07\nNo payments since Aug\n2005\n\u00b6 1.f $4,052 charge off\nCharge account opened\nFeb 04, $4,052 charged\noff Dec 05, for collection\nJan 06\nNo payments since Feb 06\nIn response to DOHA financial interrogatories, Applicant admitted on August 28,\n2007, that he had not made any payments on the debts since August 2005\u2013in the case\nof SOR \u00b6 1.f, February 2006\u2014as he had not been in a financial position to address the\ndebts, in part due to uncertainty about his employment status. He added he was \u201ctrying\nto stay current on his other financial obligations\u201d and reiterated his intent to arrange\nrepayment terms for his delinquent accounts:\nWhen I spoke with the investigator, I told him that I planned to make\narrangements to begin satisfying the debts within 12 months. That is still\nmy desire and intention. I am current on my other financial obligations.\nThese debts are past due because of an extended employment gap ans\nwell as major surgery which exhausted my savings.\n(Item 7). A check of Applicant\u2019s credit on January 2, 2008, revealed no progress in\nresolving his delinquent accounts. He was making payments on several other credit\ncard accounts rated as current. Their outstanding balances totaled $19,104 as of\nDecember 2007. Most of the accounts were close to the credit limit. One account with a\nretail wholesale club was over its limit by $11. Applicant was making his $614 monthly\nmortgage payment on time  (Item 5).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant incurred about $94,000 in delinquent credit card debt that was charged\noff and/or placed for collection during the last quarter of 2005. Significant security\nconcerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nDue to accruing interest on the accounts in collection, his delinquent debt is now\nabout $104,000. AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) clearly does\nnot apply. Applicant\u2019s job layoff from June 2003 to February 2004 and his unexpected\nsurgery in fall 2004 implicate AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). Yet \u00b6 20(b) does not adequately\nallay the judgment concerns in this case. Based on figures similar to those he reported\nin February 2007, his monthly expenses would have been around $2,000 a month.\nAssuming he relied on consumer credit exclusively to pay those costs for the seven\nmonths in 2003/04 and again for three months in late 2004, he owes much more in\ncredit card debt than what would have been required to maintain his household.\nApplicant finds himself under a significant debt burden in large part because of his\nfailure to manage consumer credit responsibly.\nApplicant has remained current in his living expenses and on some credit card\naccounts. This is not enough to demonstrate a favorable change in his financial habits,\ngiven his failure to take any action since February 2006 to address his delinquent credit\ncard debt. According to his e-QIP, he was again unemployed from March until June\n2006. His failure to make any payments toward his delinquent debt during the three\nmonths is understandable, but he has since been consistently employed by the defense\ncontractor. As of his interview with a government investigator in February 2007, it\nshould have been clear to him that the government was concerned about his finances.\nApplicant expressed his intent to contact his creditors by the end of the year. By late\nAugust 2007, he had not done anything to arrange for repayment, due to uncertainty\nabout his employment status but also because he was not in a position to do so. A\n\n7\npromise to arrange for repayment in the future, however sincere, is not enough for\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol\u201d) or AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). The prospects are not good for Applicant\nresolving his sizeable delinquent debt in the foreseeable future. As of December 2007,\nhe owed $19,104 in current credit card balances on which he was making payments.\nConsiderable doubts are raised about his judgment where he continues to incur new\ncredit card debt while older consumer credit accounts go unpaid.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant remains under a significant debt burden that is not likely to be resolved\nin the near future. He continues to incur new debt as older obligations are ignored.\nApplicant\u2019s candor about his debts is in his favor, but given his demonstrated financial\nirresponsibility, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n(Same debt as \u00b6 1.a)\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not  clearly consistent with national security\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                                        \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(EQIP) Questionnaire on April 13, 2006. On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in \nwriting and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nassigned to me on June 3, 2008. I convened a hearing on June 30, 2008, to consider \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced seven \nexhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 7 and admitted to the record without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He attached \nfour exhibits to the SOR, which were identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through \nD and admitted to the record without objection.  At his hearing, Applicant introduced an \nadditional exhibit, which I mistakenly marked as Ex. A.  The correct identification for the \nexhibit is Ex. A-1. \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of Ex. A-1, stating that the \ndocument, which Applicant represented as a communication from a national consumer \ncredit reporting organization, failed to identify Applicant and his address of record with \nspecificity and failed to explain why it no longer listed two debts on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport.  Applicant stated he offered Ex. A-1 to show that a credit repair company he had \nhired had been communicating with the consumer credit reporting organization on his \nbehalf. I overruled Department Counsel\u2019s objection and admitted Ex. A-1 for any \nprobative value it might have.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing \nthe amount of the delinquent debt identified at \u00b6 1.a from $1,371 to $1,361.  Department \nCounsel stated that the evidence provided at the hearing established the lesser debt.  \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s motion, and the SOR was amended \naccordingly.  \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness July 7, 2008, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the \nrecord.  Applicant did not file any additional information, and I closed the record on July \n8, 2008.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July 14, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 19 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.s.)  In his Answer to the SOR, dated \nMay 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008, Applicant admitted 18 of the allegations \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.r); he denied one allegation (\u00b6 1.s.) and provided documentation to \ncorroborate his statement that the debt had been paid. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 15-16, 76, 85; Ex. D.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, a high school graduate, never married, and without \nchildren or other dependents.  From October 2005 until April 26, 2008, when his \neligibility for a security clearance was suspended as a result of receiving the SOR, \nApplicant was employed as a security guard by a government contractor. (Ex. 1; Tr. 33, \n95-96.)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn addition to his current unemployment, Applicant has been unemployed two \ntimes since graduating from high school in 1984. In 2003, he suffered a heart attack and \nwas unemployed for four months.  From March 1990 to February 1991, he was laid off \nfrom a job and collected unemployment compensation.  (Tr. 39-41.)     \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed under oath by an authorized investigator in December \n2006, Applicant acknowledged several financial delinquencies that were not listed on \nhis SF-86.  He told the investigator that his financial delinquencies were attributable to a \nsix-month period of unemployment as the result of injuring his ankle in 2001 or 2002. \nApplicant reported that he had no health insurance when he was injured, and he was \nresponsible for all medical expenses relating to the ankle injury, which required two \nseparate surgeries and many sessions of physical therapy. During this time, Applicant \nreported, his automobile was repossessed, and he used his credit cards to support \nhimself. (Ex. 3.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated that his ankle injury occurred in the 1990s and \nnot in 2001 and 2002.  He stated that he no longer owed any debts related to his ankle \ninjury and subsequent unemployment.1  He further stated that all of the debts alleged on \nthe SOR had occurred since 2003.  (Tr. 41-45.)  \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he was responsible for \n18 financial delinquencies totaling approximately $19,955.  The SOR alleged the \nfollowing delinquencies: an unsatisfied deficiency balance of about $12,513 on an \nautomobile that was repossessed and sold in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.); a debt of $1,361 \nto a medical provider, referred for collection in about September 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.); a \ndebt of $268 to a medical provider, referred for collection in about November 2001 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.); a debt of $234, referred for collection in about September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d.); a debt of $45, referred for collection in about November 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a debt \nof $50, referred for collection in about May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.); a medical debt of $350, \nreferred for collection in about May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h.); a medical debt of $100, referred \nfor collection in about May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.); a cable debt of about $1,127, referred for \ncollection in about October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j.); and a debt of $408 to a communications \nutility, referred for collection in about June 2006. (SOR \u00b6 1.k.). \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleged the following additional debts: a debt of $445, \nreferred for collection in about August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.); a medical debt of $114, \nreferred for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.m.); a cable debt of $231, referred for \ncollection in about October 2006 (\u00b61.n.); a medical debt of $777, referred for collection \nin about January 2007 (SOR \u00b61.o.); a medical debt of $100, referred for collection in \nabout August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.p.); a medical debt of $75, referred for collection in about \n \n1 Applicant later acknowledged that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b61.a.arose at the time of his ankle injury. (Tr. \n52.) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAugust 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.q.); and a medical debt of $149, referred for collection in about \nAugust 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.r.).   \n \n \nIn an interview with an authorized investigator in December 2006, Applicant \nstated he hired credit repair company A in July 2006 to help him resolve his financial \ndelinquencies.  He told the investigator he paid credit repair company A $45 a month for \nthis service.  Applicant decided Company A was not helping him, and sometime in early \n2007, he hired Company B to assist him with his financial delinquencies.  He testified he \npaid Company B $60 a month to represent him before his creditors and resolve his \ndebts. He stated that Company B estimated it could resolve his debts in about one year. \nNeither Company A nor Company B has provided Applicant with credit counseling or \nassistance in developing a budget. Applicant stated he would submit as post-hearing \ndocuments a copy of his contract with Company B and e-mail reports from Company B \non the status of the payment of debts it was attempting to resolve for him.  However, \nApplicant failed to provide this information.   (Ex. 3; Tr. 91, 118-121.) \n \n \nApplicant had an automobile repossessed in February 2001.  He listed this \nrepossession on the SF-86 he signed and certified on April 13, 2006, and he \nacknowledged this repossession in his interview with an authorized investigator in \nDecember 2006. In June 2002, Applicant purchased a new vehicle. The vehicle was \nrepossessed in July 2004 when he failed to make the required monthly payments.  \nApplicant owed a deficiency balance of $12,513 on the vehicle. He did not list this \ndelinquency on his SF-86 and he did not address this debt in his interview with an \nauthorized investigator in December 2006. (Ex. 3; Ex. 7; Tr. 63-70.)  \n \n \nApplicant purchased a new automobile in April 2005.  His monthly payments on \nthe vehicle are $427.  He purchased another vehicle, a truck, in September 2007.  His \nmonthly payments on the truck are $294.  (Ex. 4; Tr. 106-114.) \n \n \nIn August 2006, Appellant returned to live at his parents\u2019 home for about six \nmonths in order to save money and satisfy some of his delinquent bills. He paid his \nparents $100 in rent each month.  He had a net remainder at the end of each month of \nabout $1,600.  He told an authorized investigator that he planned to use that money to \nsatisfy the debt alleged at SOR \u00b61.c. and other delinquent debts. However, he gave the \nmoney to a friend so she could pay her bills.  He estimated that he gave his friend about \n$1,200 each month for about seven months. She has not repaid the money lent to her \nby Applicant. He did not use his monthly net remainders to pay any of his delinquent \ndebts.  (Ex. 3; Tr. 102-104.) \n \n \nFrom December 2006 to about April 2008, Appellant reported a gross monthly \nsalary of $3,600 from his full-time employment.  In addition, he had a part-time job until \nJanuary or February 2008 that paid him $160 a week.  Applicant\u2019s net monthly income \nbetween December 2006 and about January 2008 was approximately $2,900.  (Tr. 95-\n99.) \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant reported the following monthly fixed expenses: rent: $750; groceries: \n$200; health insurance: $226; credit repair contract with Company B: $60; utilities: \n$200; cell phone: $65; automobile insurance: $172; car payment: $427: truck payment: \n$294; miscellaneous: $100.  His total fixed monthly expenses were $2,494.  (Ex 3; Tr. \n100-102, 115-116.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility was suspended in April 2008, and he has \nnot worked for his employer since that time.  He claims $300 in monthly income and \n$380 a week in unemployment compensation, for a total monthly income of about \n$1,800.  He has no savings.  He does not have a retirement account. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant asserted he would pay all of his delinquent debts that were less \nthan $300 by September 2008. Applicant provided evidence to corroborate his \nstatement that he had paid a debt of $81 on April 28, 2008. The debt was alleged at \nSOR \u00b61.s. All other debts alleged on the SOR remain unsatisfied. (Answer to SOR, \ndated May 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008; Tr. 85, 114-116.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from  \nSeptember 2001 to the present time. While he suffered a heart attack in 2003 and was \nconsequently unemployed for four months, he was continuously employed from October \n2005 to April 2008 in a full-time job, and he also had a part-time job until January 2008. \nHis net income from his full-time and part-time jobs was approximately $2,900 a month.  \nApplicant admitted that 18 of the 19 delinquencies alleged on the SOR remained \nunresolved, resulting in substantial debt which continues to the present day, a situation \nwhich raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.   \n \nApplicant had not received financial counseling. While he did not dispute his \ndebts and admitted that he was responsible for them, it was not clear that he \nunderstood his financial problems or how to resolve them.  He failed to demonstrate \nhow the credit repair companies he had hired were working to resolve his financial \ndelinquencies.  He failed to produce documents to corroborate his statement that credit \nrepair company B was remedying his financial problems by paying his creditors on his \nbehalf. He had no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt \nand prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part in \nmitigation, but that AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG 20(e) do not apply in \nmitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nseveral years ago and continue to the present. He has not taken affirmative action to \npay or resolve the majority of his delinquent debts, and his many delinquencies and his \nlack of attention to them continue to raise security concerns.  He held his most recent \njob since October 2005, and he used his income to purchase an automobile and a truck. \nHowever, he paid only one of the 19 debts alleged on the SOR.  Despite a steady \nincome for several years, he failed to budget his income to satisfy his many other debts.  \nInstead, he continued on a pattern of financial over-extension, which, in the past, led to \nbad debts and vehicle repossessions. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",
