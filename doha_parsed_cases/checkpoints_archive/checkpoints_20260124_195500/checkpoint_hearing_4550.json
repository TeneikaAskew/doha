The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2023. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 18, 2023, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on June 22, 2023. At the hearing, the Government \noffered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The Applicant offered ten exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \nA through J, which were admitted without objection. He also testified on his own behalf. \nThe evidentiary record closed at the end of the hearing. (Tr. p. 78.) DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 5, 2023. \nOn February 1, 2024, Applicant submitted a motion to re-open the record for the \nlimited purpose of submitting three additional exhibits. Department Counsel had no \nobjection. The undersigned Administrative Judge granted Applicant\u2019s motion and the \nrecord was re-opened. Applicant submitted three additional exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits K, L, and M, which were admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 26 years old. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Industrial Engineering \nand a minor in Mathematics. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Project \nManager. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has an extensive history of purchasing and using illegal drugs including \nmarijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and \nthe use of prescription drugs not prescribed to him include Adderall, Vyvanse, \nTramadol, Vicodin and Xanax. Applicant was hired by his current employer on July 8, \n2021. He submitted his application for a security clearance in May 2022. Applicant \nadmitted to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR except allegation 1.i., \nconcerning the sale of marijuana. \n1.a. and 1.b.

(Tr. p. 38.) Given the \nseven years he has used marijuana, he admits to using it over 1,000 times. (Tr. p. 63.) \nHe would normally use it in social settings with his friends. During the years he used \nmarijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his habit. (Tr. p. \n43.) \nAfter beginning employment with the defense contractor, Applicant continued to \nuse marijuana until March 2022. He stated that he stopped using it because he became \naware of its potential security implications and because he wanted to change his \nlifestyle. Applicant testified from his personal knowledge that there are people at his \ncompany who use marijuana and who hold security clearances. Applicant provided the \nnames of two of these employees. (Tr. p. 72.) He mentioned that there are others, but \nhe has only learned about them through the grapevine. \n1.c. and 1.d. Applicant has used and purchased cocaine nine times from about 2015 to \nApril 2021. He used cocaine in social settings with his friends. He stated that he did \nnot enjoy it. He also used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms three times from \nSeptember 2016 to about March 2021. He did not particularly enjoy this experience \neither. (Tr. p. 47- 48.) \n1.e. \nApplicant has used and purchased prescription medications, namely Adderall \nand Vyvanse not prescribed to him, from about August 2016 to November 2018. He \nexplained that he used it as a study aid. He would usually use these drugs with friends \nin his study group. \n1.f. \nApplicant used Tramadol on one occasion in October 2017. He remembers that \nhe had pain from a laceration on his hand. His sister had a pill left over from her \nwisdom tooth removal, and she gave it to him. \n1.g. \nApplicant used Vicodin on one occasion in about July 2018. He suffered a \nhamstring injury while playing intramural football and a friend offered his Vicodin to him. \n1.h. \nApplicant used and purchased Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on two \noccasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017. He acknowledges that he was \nyoung and na\u00efve at the time. He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at \nthe time he used it. He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks \nassociated with the drug. \n1.i. \nApplicant denied that he ever sold marijuana. However, he admitted that in \n2017, on one occasion, he was the middleman responsible for taking the marijuana to a \nfriend of his, and then returning the money to another friend who owned the marijuana. \n(Tr. p. 55-56.) Applicant stated that he did not receive any money for his efforts. \n1.j. \nApplicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in \nabout August 2015. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he made a knowing and conscious decision to use these \ndrugs when he did so, and he knew that he was violating both state and Federal law \nwhen he used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms.  (Tr. pp. 63-\n66.)   \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Senior Manager and other \nprofessional colleagues, including a roommate, attest to Applicant\u2019s high level of \nmaturity and job responsibility. \nApplicant is considered to be a highly driven \nprofessional and the go-to person as an expert in certain areas as an Engineer and \nData Analyst. Applicant\u2019s good character, work ethic, and commitment to the principles \nof integrity and confidentiality are noted, among other laudatory remarks. Applicant \ntestified that his Senior Manager, who has supported him, told the security officer that if \nApplicant were to be denied his security clearance, steps would be taken to keep him \non the program.  (Tr. p. 75, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and I.) \nHair Drug Test results dated March 1, 2023; March 24, 2023; May 11, 2023; and \nJune 8, 2023, were negative. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and H.) Applicant submitted \nadditional drug test results dated August 21, 2023; October 23, 2023; and December \n19, 2023, which were all negative. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits K, L, and M.) \nApplicant submitted a statement of intent dated March 23, 2023, declaring that \nhe will never misuse substances in the future. He stated that he plans to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledges that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nNotes concerning Applicant\u2019s performance appraisals indicate that he was an \nexcellent performer in 2021, and that he continues to be impressive, showing \noutstanding job performance. \nHe is described as a hard worker whose skill and \ndiligence has helped to make the projects successful. He continues to be an extremely \nvaluable member of the team as he continues to expand his knowledge and \nunderstanding of various aspects of his job responsibilities.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant has a long history of drug abuse, as set forth in detail in the Findings of \nFact. His illegal drug use occurred from 2015 through March 2022. AG \u00b6 25a, and 25c \nare applicable. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions demonstrate full mitigation: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nI have considered all of the evidence in the record, including the letters of \nrecommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant, which are all very favorable. \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement in \nthe future. I have also considered all of his drug test results which were negative. \nHowever, given his extensive history of illegal drug use, involving a wide variety of \nillegal drugs, used on various occasions over a recent seven year period, from about \nJuly 2015 to March 2022, it is too soon to determine that he will remain drug free. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant started working for a defense contractor in July 2021. He stated that \nhe last used marijuana in March 2022. He continued to use marijuana after he started \nworking for a defense contractor. It is noted that among the number of illegal drugs he \nhas used, his drug of choice was marijuana, as he used it most frequently in upwards of \nabout 1,000 times. In fact, Applicant used marijuana as recently as 14 months before \nthe hearing. Given the recency and extent of his marijuana use combined with his use \nof the other illegal drugs, some of which are very dangerous mind-altering drugs, he \ndoes not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use demonstrates poor judgment and unreliability. \nThe evidence supports a finding that Applicant fails to show the requisite \ncharacter and judgment required to meet the eligibility requirements for access to \nclassified information. \nIn order to meet the eligibility requirements for access to \nclassified information, Applicant is expected to have demonstrated a pattern of good \njudgment and a high level of maturity and trustworthiness, that does not involve a recent \nand extensive history of illegal drug use. In this case, Applicant has fallen short of \nmeeting the eligibility requirements. \nI have considered Security Executive Agent (SECEA) Clarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, \ndated December 21, 2021, which provides that prior recreational use of marijuana, \nwhich of course constitutes a violation of Federal law, may be relevant in security \nclearance adjudications, but is not determinative. The guidance further emphasizes the \napplication of the \u2018whole person concept\u201d in analyzing such conduct. See also SecEA \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, dated October 25, 2014. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations, and policies, that apply to them. \nApplicant is a fairly recent college \ngraduate who disregarded the law and used a wide variety of illegal drugs indicative of a \npattern of poor judgment and immaturity. Furthermore, he continued to use marijuana \neven after he started working for a defense contractor. Under the particular facts of this \ncase, Applicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has \nthe maturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Given his extensive history of illegal \ndrug use, and the fact that he has only been drug free for 14 months as of the date of \nthe hearing, Applicant has not demonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to \nclassified information. \nThis is not an individual in whom the Government can be \nconfident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, \neven when no one is looking. More time living a drug free lifestyle is essential to ensure \nthe Government that the Applicant will not return to his illegal drug involvement. At this \ntime, Applicant is not qualified for access to classified information and does not meet \nthe qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j. \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a master\u2019s degree in 2003. He has been with his spouse for 32 years, and they married in 2015. They have no children. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, for the past four years. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1) Applicant admits he is a recovering alcoholic, and he has had multiple relapses since 2008. He accepted his challenges with alcohol and, through participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and the support of his family and friends, he has been sober since April 20, 2019. He attends AA once or twice a week and has contact with his sponsor about three times a week. He has completed the 12-step program and continues to work the program, focusing on making amends to people he hurt. He uses a daily reflection application that focuses on spirituality. He is a lifelong member of his church and attends regularly. (Tr. 23-25, 36-39) Applicant\u2019s background of alcohol abuse escalated in 2008, when he experienced personal tragedies and his drinking worsened. He was reprimanded by his employer in 2008, and he voluntarily enrolled in a rehabilitation program, but he continued to consume alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication.

He was reprimanded by his employer in \n2008, and he voluntarily enrolled in a rehabilitation program, but he continued to consume \nalcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication. (Tr. 25-27; GE 1, 2, 4) \nIn about 2010, Applicant relapsed and abused alcohol. He voluntarily sought \ntreatment at a health center for detoxification, but he continued to abuse alcohol, at times \nin excess and to the point of intoxication. (GE 1, 2, 4) \nIn May 2012, Applicant\u2019s employment with company CT was terminated because \nof his frequent absences, consumption of alcohol during work hours, and a failed alcohol \nand drug test. (Tr. 30; GE 1, 2, 4) \nIn about 2012, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself to a recovery center for \nalcohol treatment.

He \nvoluntarily sought treatment at a medical center for detoxification, but continued to \nconsume alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication. (Tr. 26-28; GE 1, 2, \n4) \nIn March 2018, Applicant failed to attend AA meetings and discontinued his anti-\nalcohol medications, and he experienced a relapse of alcohol abuse. He was admitted to \nan inpatient detoxification program and was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder-Severe \nand Cannabinoid Use Disorder-Mild. He was recommended for further substance abuse \ndependency treatment. However, following Applicant\u2019s detoxification, he terminated \ntreatment and resumed consuming alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of \nintoxication. (Tr. 26-28; GE 1-4) \nIn April 2019, Applicant experienced a relapse of alcohol abuse and was admitted \ninto a health service facility for an inpatient detoxification program. He was again \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder-Severe and Cannabinoid Use Disorder-Mild, and it \nwas recommended he participate in substance dependence treatment. Following \ndetoxification, Applicant terminated treatment. (Tr. 28-29; GE 1-4) \nApplicant testified that he initially tried AA, but he was too stubborn and knew what \nto do and thought he could address his alcohol abuse on his own. He would remain sober \nfor a period and then relapse. Finally, in April 2019, he realized consuming alcohol was \nnot fun anymore. His spouse had had enough, and his family was aware of his problems. \nHe knew he had to get sober and did. He is confident and comfortable that he will not \nrelapse but is vigilant in understanding he cannot make any guarantees about his \nsobriety. (Tr. 26-29) \nApplicant admitted that during the years he was abusing alcohol (2008-2019), he \ninfrequently used marijuana when it was offered to him by others. He did not use it on a \nregular basis and did not purchase it. He used it when it was available. He stated that \nalcohol was always his first choice. He has not used marijuana since he has been sober. \nHe no longer has contact with any of the acquaintances with whom he had previously \nused marijuana. He does not intend to use it in the future. (Tr. 29-30, 43) \nOn Applicant\u2019s March 2021 Security Clearance Application (SCA), Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d and failed to disclose his prior marijuana use in response to Section 23-\nIllegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances: \u201cIn the last seven years have you illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances. During his May 2021 background investigation, \nhe was not initially forthcoming about his marijuana use, denying drug use and then \nadmitting it when he was confronted with information about his past use. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not have a security clearance at the time he used marijuana. He \nsaid he used it about eight times with some friends in 2012. He said he did not disclose \nthis use because it did not fall within the seven-year disclosure requirement, and it was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nan honest mistake. He told the investigator that he had not used marijuana or any other \ntype of drug since 2012. He said that he did not list it on his SCA because it occurred \nmore than seven years ago. (Tr. 30; GE 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleged that Applicant falsified his March 2021 SCA when he responded \n\u201cno\u201d as to whether in the past seven years he had illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances. In Applicant\u2019s medical record from March 9, 2018, he disclosed to the \nattending doctor that he smokes marijuana lightly and will smoke maybe half a marijuana \ncigarette twice a month. He further stated to the doctor that he last smoked marijuana \nthree weeks earlier. In his April 20, 2019 medical record, he disclosed that in the past \nmonth he had used cannabis, on average, a few puffs over the course of the week. (GE \n3) \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR responding to \u00b6 3.a, he stated: \nI admit. I am here to make a good-faith effort to correct my omission of \nmarijuana use beyond the timeframe of early 2012. This was not a \ndeliberate falsification but simply an oversight on my part. With alcohol \nhaving been the major hurdle and issue in my life, I was so focused on these \nquestions that when I got through the marijuana questions, I inadvertently \nanswered No\u201d since it was not a big part of my life based upon the limited \nfrequency of my usage. My misuse of marijuana up to 2019 was so \ninfrequent and the circumstances surrounding my use did not include any \nof my current contacts and acquaintances and are unlikely to recur. Again, \nI did not hold a security clearance during this time of misuse. With nearly 4 \nyears of sobriety and abstinence, I am confident in my recovery progress \nand the positive behavioral changes that I have made should reinforce my \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment going forward. I do not believe \nthis mistake should be cause for a denial of my security clearance.  \nSeveral times at Applicant\u2019s hearing, he was asked why he failed to disclose his \ndrug use on his SCA. He testified that his drug use was a small part of his life, and he \nthought he disclosed it and provided information about his 2012 drug use. He explained \nhe used marijuana infrequently, and he was not trying to be intentionally deceptive. He \ndid not recall the specifics of his use due to memory lapses. He did not see his use as a \nsignificant part of his life. His last marijuana use was in April 2019 at a friend\u2019s house. He \nwould use it infrequently when it was available and when he was drinking alcohol, and \nnever when he was sober. He said he did not understand why he answered \u201cno\u201d on the \nMay 2021 SCA about his past drug use, and he was not trying to be deceptive. He said \nhe is not the same person. (Tr. 30-34, 39-52) \nI find Applicant was aware that he was required to disclose his past drug use on \nhis SCA and deliberately failed to disclose it. When he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in May 2021, he was not honest with the investigator when he minimized his \ndrug use by telling her he had not used marijuana since 2012, which was false. I find \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his past drug use on his March 2021 SCA. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he fully acknowledges his abuse of \nalcohol and marijuana.

He stated: \nAs of April 20, 2023, I will celebrate 4 years of sobriety and abstinence from \nalcohol. At this point in my recovery journey, I fully acknowledge my abuse \npotential and maladaptive alcohol use and the negative aspects it brought \nto all areas of my life. I attribute my success thus far to my personal drive \nto live a healthy and fulfilling life without alcohol, my loving and supportive \nspouse of 30 years, my weekly participation in Alcoholics Anonymous, my \nsponsorship and accountability, my anti-alcohol medication, and my strong \nnetwork of family and friends. At 48 years of age, I understand all the \ndifficulties that a first drink could bring me, and I am positive in my ability to \nremain on this path of recovery as I put my full priority on sobriety, health, \nfamily, and career. (SOR answer) \nFour character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. They all are aware of the \nallegations in the SOR. His spouse testified that he is in a good place and alcohol is no \nlonger part of his life. He confirmed Applicant\u2019s commitment to AA and working the \nprogram. He confirmed Applicant no longer uses alcohol or drugs. He considers Applicant \nhonest and trustworthy. The other witnesses testified they are aware of Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol struggles and confirmed he has been sober for several years. They believe \nApplicant is honest and trustworthy. (Tr. 52-85) \nApplicant submitted performance evaluations from his current employer (2020\u00ad\n2023) and past employer from 2017 and 2018 reflecting his excellent performance. He \nprovided numerous certificates of completion for various courses. (AE A-S) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosed by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol abuse disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant had alcohol-related incidents at work. He was reprimanded by his \nemployer in 2008 for alcohol abuse, and, in 2012, he was terminated for consumption of \nalcohol during work hours, frequent absenteeism, and failing an alcohol and drug. He \nvoluntarily sought alcohol treatment six times from 2008 through 2019. He would at times \nterminate treatment or complete the treatment, but each time he would resume \nconsuming alcohol. He was diagnosed by duly qualified medical professionals with \nAlcohol Use Disorder-Severe. His most recent diagnosis was in 2022, and it noted he \nwas in remission. He repeatedly failed to follow treatment plans after his diagnoses and \nconsumed alcohol after his diagnoses and against treatment recommendations. The \nevidence supports the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has been sober and participating in AA since 2019, almost five years. It \nis not unusual for those suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder to stumble before coming to \nterms that they are powerless over their condition, need to accept help, and commit to \ntheir sobriety. Applicant failed to remain sober after treatment on several occasions. He \nnow accepts his challenges with alcohol, and, through participation in AA and the support \nof his family and friends, he has remained sober. He attends AA once or twice a week \nand has contact with his sponsor about three times a week. He has completed the 12-\nstep program and continues to work the program focusing on making amends to people \nhe hurt. He uses a daily reflection application that focuses on spirituality. He readily \nacknowledges his alcohol history and has provided evidence to overcome his problem. \nAA is a recognized and respected program to help those with alcohol issues. Applicant \nhas successfully participated in the program for close to five years. All of the above \nmitigating conditions apply.  \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder. \nApplicant infrequently used marijuana from about 2012 to April 2019. During his \n2018 inpatient detoxification program, he was diagnosed with Cannabinoid Use-\nDisorder-Mild and again in April 2019. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was related to his alcohol abuse. The same analysis \nunder Guideline G is applicable under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline. Applicant has been sober for almost five years and continues to be faithful to \nabstaining from alcohol and drugs. Based on his commitment to sobriety, I find that future \nillegal drug use is unlikely to recur. He has established a pattern of abstinence, no longer \nassociates with drug users, and has avoided an environment where drugs are present. \nThe above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use on his March 2021 SCA. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his concealment and \nfalsification about his drug use. He was afforded an opportunity to set the record straight \nand disclose it during his interview with a government investigator but failed to disclose \nhis more recent marijuana use. He specifically told the investigator that he had not used \nany illegal drug since 2012, which was false. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Failing to be \nhonest during the security clearance process is not a minor offense. The process relies \non those seeking a clearance to be honest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so on \nhis SCA and during his background interview. In his answer to the SOR and at his hearing \nhe admitted his more recent drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his most recent drug use was not minor. \nHis justifications for why he did not disclose the information is troubling. He has not taken \nfull responsibility for his failure to be truthful which raises security concerns. The security \nclearance process relies on people to be candid and not parse their answers according \nto their own interpretations to straightforward inquiries. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he successfully \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. He failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

At the hearing, I received nine Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 9), 18 exhibits \nof Applicant (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through AE R), and the testimony of Applicant and \nfour character witnesses. The hearing took two days to complete. Part two of the hearing \nwas conducted on May 21, 2024. The transcript (Tr. I) of the first day\u2019s hearing was \nreceived on May 22, 2024. The Tr. of part two of the hearing was received on May 29, \n2024. (Tr. II) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old single man with one child, age 16. (GE 3 at 34) He was \nborn in Haiti and immigrated to the United States at age 12. After graduating from high \nschool, he joined the U.S. Air Force where he served from 2001 to 2005. Upon his \nseparation, he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (GE F) Applicant \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in information technology in \n2008. (GE 3 at 29) He was first granted a security clearance in 2004. (AE K; GE I at 41) \nApplicant has worked for various defense contractors in the field of systems \nadministration. (AE G)  He has been working for his current employer since July 2021. (GE \nI at 17) He is highly respected on the job. His current supervisor characterizes him as a \n\u201dhighly valued member of [the] team,\u201d whose programs are \u201cwell run, healthy, on time, and \non budget.\u201d (AE L) According to a previous supervisor, who began working with him in June \n2021, he \u201calways demonstrated outstanding character, integrity, and professionalism.\u201d (AE \nK) And a coworker characterizes him as a detail-oriented, organized individual who is \n\u201calways willing to assist others as a mentor, answer questions, and take the time to develop \nless-experienced staff members when possible.\u201d (AE P) Per a government client, Applicant \n\u201cdemonstrated extensive knowledge of project management techniques and superb \ncommunication skills.\u201d (GE 3 at 39) According to a former supervisor who worked with him \nprimarily between 2007 and 2012, he was a good worker, and a reliable and trustworthy \nindividual. (Tr. II at 124)  A previous coworker who worked with him between 2011 and \n2012 characterized him as a standup guy with a \u201cthirst for knowledge.\u201d (Tr. II at 131) \nIn July 2008, while in the military, Applicant was disciplined for unauthorized creation \nand cloning of an email account. (Tr. I at 67) Specifically, Applicant, as an information \ntechnology troubleshooter,  was tasked with fixing an email network that was down. (Tr. I at \n67) Once he fixed it, he tested it by cloning email accounts of others and sending \nmessages. (Tr. I at 67) When he cloned the account of a lieutenant, it \u201cgave the perception \nthat [he] was an officer.\u201d (Tr. I at 67) Consequently, he received non-judicial punishment of \nreduction in rank from E-4 to E-1, and was administratively separated with a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions, as noted above. (Tr. I at  69)  \nApplicant worked for Company 1, a defense contractor that serves the U.S. military \nin locations worldwide, from November 2019 to April 2021. (Tr. I at 54) In September 2019, \nhe was reassigned from a project in central Europe, where he had been living, to a project \nin a Middle Eastern country. (Tr. I at 110) Because of the pandemic and a travel ban \nimposed by the Middle Eastern country, the project was postponed. His employer then \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplaced Applicant on unpaid leave, pending the lifting of the travel ban, and sent him home \nto the United States to complete a medical screening and to take other administrative steps \nto prepare for the eventual transfer to the Middle Eastern country. (Tr. I at 76, 144) \nApplicant went to the United States, as instructed. On October 9, 2020, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer contacted him and told him to report for work on October 13, 2020, for one of \ntheir clients in the state where Applicant was then located. (Tr. 74; GE 5 at 13) On October \n12, 2024, Applicant informed his employer that his father, a Haitian resident, had been \nhospitalized and that his condition was deteriorating rapidly.  (GE 5 at 11) In addition, he \ntold his employer that he would be taking the week off \u201cto join him and assist the family.\u201d \n(GE 5 at 11) Applicant did not travel to Haiti, as he told his employer. Instead, on October \n14, 2020, he traveled to an African country for a vacation, and stayed through October 28, \n2020. (GE 4 at 33; Tr. I at 134) ) Applicant never submitted a foreign travel report to \nCompany 1 for his trip to the African country, as required. (GE 9 at 1) Applicant had \noriginally planned to travel to Haiti but did not go because of its excessive civil unrest at the \ntime. (GE 4 at 80) \nOn October 17, 2020, Applicant\u2019s father passed away. (GE 5 at 9) That day, \nApplicant emailed his employer requesting extended leave though November 12, 2020, \nbecause he needed to assist his family with the funeral arrangements and emotionally \nsupport his mother. (GE 5 at 9). \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s October 17, 2020 email, his employer extended his leave \nto November 12, 2020. (GE 5 at 6) In a return email on October 23, 2020, Applicant \nthanked his employer for their understanding, stating that his \u201cfather had been the rock in \n[his] family throughout the years and [would] truly be missed.\u201d (GE 5 at 5) Further, he \nexpressed his appreciation for his employer allowing him the extra time to spend with his \nmother, explaining that he could \u201cnot fathom leaving [her] all alone at this time.\u201d (GE 5 at 5) \nWhen Applicant wrote this email, he was in Africa, and his mother was not with him. (GE 5 \nat 9) Moreover, contrary to the email, neither Applicant nor his mother had a relationship \nwith his father because he abandoned the family when Applicant was between three and \nfive years old. (Tr. 1 at 90) Applicant never saw him growing up, did not know his \nwhereabouts, and was raised by a gentleman with a stepfather-type relationship with him. \n(GE 5 at 6; Tr. 45) In addition, he did not know his father was alive until his mother told him \nin October 2020. (GE 4 at 80) \nIn November 2020, Applicant took a job with another defense contractor. (Company \n2; GE 4 at 32) When Applicant took the second position, he was on leave of absence \nwithout pay from Company 1 and waiting for the restriction to be lifted on traveling to the \nMiddle Eastern country where his next assignment was scheduled. (Answer at 3) Applicant \ndid not tell Company 1 that he took another job. He did not consider working for Company 2 \nto be a problem because he was working for a different agency with Company 2, and he \nwas on unpaid leave from Company 1, waiting to be transferred to a job in a Middle Eastern \ncountry. (GE 3 at 29; GE 4 at 31) His intention was to quit working for Company 2 as soon \nas he was cleared to travel to the Middle Eastern location where Company 1 had assigned \nhim. (GE 3 at 14) Ultimately, Applicant resigned from Company 1 in April 2021 after they \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplaced him on administrative leave pending an internal investigation into his activities. (GE \n3 at 30; GE 7 at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified. When asked during cross-examination \nwhether he would have a problem with one of his employees simultaneously working for \nanother employer, he answered \u201cno,\u201d explaining that although companies in his industry \nwant employers with a \u201c24/7/365\u201d mentality,\u201d in a situation such as Applicant when the \nemployee is in between assignments and not working, it is \u201calmost preferable,\u201d that they \nobtain a position with another company because it is more cost beneficial for the employee \nto work elsewhere while between assignments than to be on the company payroll while not \nworking, and just waiting for a call from the next contractor. (Tr. II at 165) \nApplicant\u2019s position with Company 2 was in a Western European country. (GE 4 at \n32) In November 2020, he requested leave through January 2021 to travel to the United \nStates for the birth of his child. (Tr. I at 42; GE 8 at 2) Applicant was approved leave; \nhowever, he did not visit his girlfriend and the baby. Instead, he went on vacation without \ninforming Company 2. The SOR alleges that Applicant provided misleading or false \ninformation to Company 2\u2019s timekeeper regarding the explanation for taking leave. \nApplicant denies this allegation, asserting that when he applied for leave, he intended to \nvisit his girlfriend and be present at or around the time of the baby\u2019s birth. (Tr. I at 119) \nHowever, the birth occurred before the scheduled leave, and a man whom his girlfriend \nwas romantically involved, unbeknownst to Applicant, while he was overseas, took a DNA \ntest, which confirmed that he, not Applicant, was the baby\u2019s father. By then, Applicant\u2019s \nleave had been approved. He did not tell his employer what happened because he was \nembarrassed. (Tr. I at 17) \nIn December 2020, Applicant\u2019s sister in the United States contacted him to tell him \nthat their mother and his stepfather had been in a serious car accident, and that his \nstepfather passed away, while their mother was in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. (ICU) \nApplicant was working for Company 2 in Western Europe at the time. (Tr. I at 124) \nSubsequently, Applicant informed his supervisor and took leave to travel home to the \nUnited States. \nWhen Applicant arrived home, he discovered that his mother was in the ICU, as his \nsister had informed him, but that she was mistaken as to the identity of the passenger in \nthe car who had passed away. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s stepfather was not in the car. \nInstead, it was a friend of his mother. (Tr. 124) Applicant never corrected this information \nwith his supervisor. Instead, he emailed the supervisor and told him that he was in the \nprocess of coordinating his stepfather\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 124) \nWhen Applicant was in the United States visiting his mother, Company 1 offered him \na position in a city near his hometown where his mother was recuperating from the car \naccident. In January 2021, he took this job and resigned from Company 2. (Tr. II at 47; GE \n4 at 32) He took this position because it afforded him the opportunity to work near the city \nwhere his mother was recuperating. (Answer at 6) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter submitting his resignation, Applicant began completing his out-processing \npaperwork. (Tr. 48) The out processing was delayed because his common access card \n(CAC), together with his automobile and most of his personal belongings were at his \nresidence in the Western European country where he had been living while working for \nCompany 2. (Tr. II at 48) He made plans to ship his automobile to his new home, and \ninformed his employer when he would return to his previous residence in Western Europe \nto pick up the remainder of his belongings. (Tr. II at 49) His employer expressed no \nobjections. (Tr. II at 49) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in deciding. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this concern, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant has a history of not being candid with his employers, and \nat times, lying to his employers about relevant information when applying for leave. In \ntandem with his discipline while in the Air Force for unauthorized cloning of an email \naccount, the following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16 credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulation, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information [including] \n(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nWhen Applicant took a job with Company 2 in November 2020, he was on unpaid \nleave from Company 1. Moreover, his work for Company 2 involved a different agency than \nthe agency he worked for through Company 1. Under these circumstances, there was no \nconflict of interest. I resolve subparagraph 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant resigned from Company 2 in February 2021 after being offered a position \nwith Company 1 near the city where his mother was recovering from a major car accident. \nApplicant\u2019s expressed desire to work in an area close to his mother rather than overseas \nduring her health crisis was credible. Consequently, I resolve subparagraph 1.e in his favor. \nApplicant\u2019s out-processing from Company 2 after resigning was delayed. However, \nthe departure paperwork was delayed because he had left his CAC card in his car in \nWestern Europe where he had lived while working for Company 2. Given that he ultimately \ncompleted the out-processing steps, and that there is no record that his ex-employer raised \nany concerns about this, I conclude that there are no security concerns with respect to the \nout-processing process. I resolve subparagraph 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant applied for leave from Company 2 in November 2020 to go home \nthe following month to be present for the birth of his girlfriend\u2019s child, he sincerely thought it \nwas his baby. He did not know that another man was the father until after he had applied \nfor leave. Consequently, he was not being dishonest when he completed the leave \napplication. I conclude subparagraph 1.d generates no security concern. \nConversely, the lie Applicant told Company 1 about his father, as set forth in \nsubparagraph 1.b, triggers the unmitigated application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). At first glance, \nApplicant\u2019s dishonest explanation for needing to take leave after his father\u2019s decline and \nsubsequent death, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b, appears immaterial. Specifically, \nApplicant had already been granted leave to attend to matters related to his father\u2019s illness \nand subsequent death before he mischaracterized their relationship. However, the scope of \nApplicant\u2019s dishonesty involved an entire false narrative that he concocted about his \nrelationship with his father. Moreover, the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s dishonesty \nwas compounded after his employer granted him additional leave to spend with his mother, \nand he, instead, went by himself on a vacation to a foreign country, which he failed to \nreport, as required by company policy. The nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \ndishonesty was further compounded when he emailed his employer from the foreign \ncountry thanking the employer for extending his leave to spend time with his mother, \nexplaining how he could not fathom leaving his mother alone during her time of grief. \nApplicant lied to Company 2 in a similar fashion after his mother was seriously \ninjured in a car accident. Specifically, he told his employer that his stepfather died in the \naccident. Not only did he fail to inform his employer that his stepfather was not in the car \nonce he found out that it was someone else; he perpetuated the falsehood that his \nstepfather died in the accident by emailing his employer that he was planning his funeral. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of rule violations and dishonesty render him an unacceptable \ncandidate for a security clearance. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies without mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nPer the testimony of coworkers, Applicant is an exceptional performer. However, this \njob performance is outweighed by his history of dishonesty with his employers. I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 43, applied for access to classified information in June 2022. On the security clearance application, she indicated that she had not been previously investigated for or granted security clearance eligibility or access. However, in February 2015, she applied for public trust eligibility in connection with her work on a federal contract. It is unclear if the public trust eligibility application was adjudicated to completion. (GE 3,5) On the February 2015 public trust application, she responded to \u2018Section 14: Illegal Drug Use,\u2019 that she had not used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs in the last year. (GE 5) On her June 2022 security clearance application, she disclosed in response to \u2018Section 23: Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,\u2019 that her first use of marijuana occurred in May 1998 and her last use occurred in November 2021. She provided the following information about the nature, frequency, and number of times she used the drug: 2018-2020: The recent use of marijuana was once a month, on a weekend, over a span of two years, starting around 2018 purchased from a dispensary in [City 1]. 2020-2021: Since 2020, I had two small occurrences with an old friend.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 24, 2023, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal \nconduct guidelines. This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.

She received a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material on April 3, 2023. In the FORM, the Government informed Applicant \nthat it was offering the summaries of her two July 2022 subject interviews with a \nbackground investigator into evidence. The Government advised Applicant of her ability \nto object to, correct, add, delete, or update the information in the subject interview \nsummary. The Government further advised her that failure to respond could result in a \ndetermination by the administrative judge that she waived any objection to the \ndocument\u2019s admissibility. She did not respond. Accordingly, the documents appended to \nthe FORM, including the summary, are admitted as GE 1 through 5, without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 43, applied for access to classified information in June 2022. On the \nsecurity clearance application, she indicated that she had not been previously \ninvestigated for or granted security clearance eligibility or access. However, in February \n2015, she applied for public trust eligibility in connection with her work on a federal \ncontract. It is unclear if the public trust eligibility application was adjudicated to \ncompletion. (GE 3,5) \nOn the February 2015 public trust application, she responded to \u2018Section 14: \nIllegal Drug Use,\u2019 that she had not used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal \ndrugs in the last year. (GE 5) On her June 2022 security clearance application, she \ndisclosed in response to \u2018Section 23: Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,\u2019 that her first \nuse of marijuana occurred in May 1998 and her last use occurred in November 2021. \nShe provided the following information about the nature, frequency, and number of \ntimes she used the drug: \n2018-2020: The recent use of marijuana was once a month, on a \nweekend, over a span of two years, starting around 2018 purchased from \na dispensary in [City 1]. \n2020-2021: Since 2020, I had two small occurrences with an old friend. \nSince then, I have had nothing. \n1998-2002: Before that, I had a very long break of ever using since \ncollege. I smoked marijuana in college and stopped before graduation as I \nwas becoming a certified teacher. (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s employment disclosures start in 2012. She worked on a federal \ncontract between January 2015 and October 2018. Between October 2108 and October \n2020, she worked as a science specialist at school. With respect to her future use of \nmarijuana, she disclosed that she did not \u201ccondone this drug anymore.\u201d She no longer \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsidered the drug good for her personal health.

In the first \ninterview, she confirmed the disclosures on her June 2022 security clearance \napplication as correct. She explained that she used marijuana because she saw it as a \nhealthier alternative to relieve stress as compared to alcohol, and because it was \nbecoming legal in the state where she lived. In the second interview, she indicated her \nfamily and friends were aware of her marijuana use and that it could not be used as a \npoint of exploitation or vulnerability. She also stated her intent to abstain from marijuana \nuse in the future, and that she no longer associated with individuals who used illegal \ndrugs. She did not make any changes or correction to her prior disclosures about her \nhistory of illegal drug use. (GE 4) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana between May 1998 and \nNovember 2021, as she disclosed on her June 2022 security clearance application. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) The SOR also alleges that she intentionally falsified her February 2015 \napplication for public trust eligibility by stating that she had not used illegal drugs within \nthe year of the application. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She denied both allegations, explaining that she \ndid not use marijuana in the year before she completed the public trust application. She \nalso explained that her disclosures about her drug use on the security clearance \napplication lacked specificity. She offered that she used the drug between 1998 to 2002, \nand again between 2018 to 2020. She explained that her use was infrequent and for \nspiritual and creative purposes for her yoga and art practices. She also indicated, for the \nfirst time, that the period of marijuana use she disclosed also had long period of \nabstinence, from 2002 to 2017 and again from 2020 to 2022. (GE 1-2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nBased on the disclosures on her June 2022 security clearance application and \nher confirmation of those disclosures in her first July 2022 subject interview, the SOR \nalleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between May 1998 and \nNovember 2021. The illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because such behavior may lead to physical \nor psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 25) Applicant\u2019s \ndisclosures establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case. The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nNone of the applicable mitigating conditions apply. Even though Applicant\u2019s last \nreported illegal drug use occurred in March 2021, the conduct is not mitigated by the \npassage of time. This period of abstinence is not sufficient given the recency and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances of her drug use, which were purely recreational. Her statements that she \nwill not use again are not credible. On her June 2022 security clearance application, \nApplicant provided two reasons for abstaining from future use of marijuana, becoming a \nteacher and her desire to obtain work on a federal contract. However, after attaining \neach of these goals, she resumed marijuana use. Based on her disclosures, she used \nmarijuana after completing an application for public trust in February 2015 and while \nworking on a federal contract between 2015 and 2018. She also used the drug between \nOctober 2018 and October 2020, when she worked in a school. The Applicant also \nresumed use of the drug after long periods of abstinence. Given her history of use, I \ncannot conclude that future use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified material facts on a February \n2015 application for public trust eligibility when she indicated that she had not used or \npossessed illegal drugs in the year before completing the application. This disclosure \nseemingly conflicted with her disclosure on the June 2022 security clearance application \nthat she used marijuana with varying frequency between May 1998 and November \n2021. A statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe SOR allegation relies on the impermissible inference drawn when comparing \nthe disclosures on Applicant\u2019s February 2015 and June 2022 applications. The \ninference assumes that she used marijuana with regular frequency during the disclosed \ntime frame \u2013 an assumption that is directly refuted by the record. The SOR also relies \non the assumption that if she used the drug between 1998 and 2021, she must have \nused the drug between 2014 and 2015. There is no evidence that the 2015 disclosure \nwas not true. Accordingly, the falsification allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts under the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Given Applicant\u2019s long history of marijuana \nuse, she failed to meet her burdens of persuasion and production to mitigate the alleged \nconcerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant is a 50-year-old contractor. He has worked for a federal department as a contractor, initially with one company from 2008 until 2022. He has been in his current position since June 2022. Since his interim security clearance was revoked in 2023, he has been denied access to his worksite. Applicant was married to his first spouse for almost four years, 2004 until 2008. He married his second spouse in June 2008, and they divorced in May 2018. He married his current spouse in July 2018. His third spouse works but was unable to work for a year because of medical reasons. (Tr. 39, 75.) He has two adult children from his second marriage and a stepchild who currently resides with him.

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nand offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 29, 2024. I kept the record open after the hearing to enable \nApplicant to submit documentary evidence. No additional evidence was received. The \nrecord closed on March 6, 2024. \nFindings of Fact\nIn Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted to the allegations under Guideline\nF. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old contractor. He has worked for a federal department as \na contractor, initially with one company from 2008 until 2022. He has been in his current \nposition since June 2022. Since his interim security clearance was revoked in 2023, he \nhas been denied access to his worksite. \nApplicant was married to his first spouse for almost four years, 2004 until 2008. He \nmarried his second spouse in June 2008, and they divorced in May 2018. He married his \ncurrent spouse in July 2018. His third spouse works but was unable to work for a year \nbecause of medical reasons. (Tr. 39, 75.) He has two adult children from his second \nmarriage and a stepchild who currently resides with him. (GE 1; Tr. at 40.) During his first \nmarriage he purchased his home from a family member in approximately 2002 that is the \nsubject of the SOR allegations. (Tr. at 48.) \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in about March 2010 claiming \napproximately $340,218 in outstanding liabilities, which was discharged in May \n2013. Applicant admitted this allegation. He explained in his Answer he took on his \nsecond spouse\u2019s debt when they got married. He disputed the $340,218 figure because \nit included his mortgage debt, which was not part of the bankruptcy. He only included his \nnon-mortgage debt of approximately $65,000 in the bankruptcy, which he resolved \nthrough the bankruptcy within four years. The bankruptcy documents show a track record \nof debt repayment and compliance with the legal terms of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nBoth Applicant and his second spouse were listed in the bankruptcy petition. (GE 2; GE \n3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due home equity loan placed for collection for $91,487. \nApplicant admitted responsibility for this debt. (Tr. at 33; GE 5 at 2.) The debt was for a \nhome equity loan to make improvements on his home and to settle some credit-card \ndebts. (GE 3 at 26; Tr. at 27-28, 53-55.) The debt was not asserted as claim in the \nbankruptcy and the Trustee's Final Report and Account reflects there was no principal \npaid or interest paid. (GE 4 at 2; Tr. at 28, 29.)

He \ntestified his second spouse had verbally agreed to pay this debt. She was supposed to \nsend the monthly payments directly to the lender. (Tr. at 54.) Their divorce decree did not \naddress marital debts. (Tr. at 54.) He had been making payments until his 2018 divorce. \n(Tr. at 54.) He states the billing statements had stopped and that the lender had listed this \ndebt as being part of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. at 54; AE A.) He notes in his \ntestimony and in his Answer that the debt did not appear in the credit report he reviewed \nand that he never received notification from the lender that the account was not being \npaid. (Answer; Tr. at 28, 32, 78.) \nApplicant testified the lender would not work with him to set up any type of \nautomatic payment plan because it wanted payment in full. (Tr. at 29, 78-79.) He has \nbeen trying to refinance his home mortgage so he can consolidate his home mortgage \npayment and the delinquent account together. (Tr. at 37, 60.) He developed this \nrefinancing plan after the SOR was issued. (Tr. 61.) His first attempt at executing this plan \nwas denied because his credit score was too low. He thought it would be several months \nbefore he could raise his credit score to meet the lender\u2019s requirements. (Tr. at 37-38.) \nApplicant testified he had been paying debts not alleged in the SOR with funds he \nobtained from cashing out a retirement account. (Tr. at 43, 68, 70.) His only credit-card \naccount is current, with a $13,000 balance and $300 monthly payment. He states he does \nnot use this credit card anymore and instead relies on a debit card. (Tr. at 41, 62, 64; GE \n6 at 5; AE A.) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation was not credible for why he believed his former spouse \nwould assume the home equity debt when 1) it was not addressed in their divorce; 2) the \nloan related to a home he owned prior to their marriage; and 3) the address the creditor \nassociated the debt with was still his. He initially testified he did not know debt was not \nresolved in the bankruptcy until the security clearance process had been initiated. (Tr. at \n29-30; GE 4 at 2.) He stated he and his former spouse \u201chad a verbal that [it] was going to \nbe taken care of along with, you know, the term equity deal, but, of course, I have no legal \ndocumentation that states that.\u201d (Tr. at 47, 53, 55.) He stopped making payments when \nhe was not getting statements from the lender anymore. (Tr. at 35.) He stated \u201c\u2026the \nbilling statements stopped coming, and I had said previously that it was my ignorance for \nnot following up with them and saying, hey, why am I not getting statements anymore, so \nmy home equity was current until 2017, 2018. 2017, I think, is the correct year.\u201d (Tr. at \n54.) He did not make any change to the billing address even though his former spouse \nno longer lived with him. (Tr. at 55.) \nApplicant testified that, after doing some research on the security clearance \n\u201ccriteria,\u201d he identified that he needed to come in with \u201cminimal debt as possible.\u201d (Tr. at \n68, 69.) In order to meet the requirements for a security clearance, he resolved a number \nof debts by cashing out a retirement account and has been paying down his other debts \nwith on time payments. (Tr. at 43, 68-70.) A January 2024 credit report shows two \ndiscrepancies, a $70 debt in collection and a closed mortgage, which lists \u201cAt least 120 \ndays or more than four payments past due.\u201d (GE 6 at 1, 8; Tr. at 49.)

Citing his credit report, he notes \nhe does not live beyond his means. (Answer.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant had debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2010 and he is past due on a \nhome equity loan. His admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations.) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant blames his former spouse \nfor not adhering to a verbal agreement made during their divorce to make the payments \non this debt, a home equity loan in his name, for a home that he kept after the divorce, \nand listed under his current address. This is not credible. He has not been making \npayments on this debt since the divorce. His behavior is recent and ongoing, which raises \nserious concerns about his judgment and reliability. He failed to address his financial \nissues until he recognized the security clearance process required him to be in good \nfinancial health. This is not a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nestablished for SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant complied with the terms of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nto resolve pre-SOR debts totaling approximately $65,000. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant did experience a divorce and his third \nspouse was unable to work for a year because of medical reasons. He began addressing \nhis debts in anticipation of the security clearance application process. He offered he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by attempting a plan, which was unsuccessful \nbecause of his low credit score. His stated reliance on a verbal statement by his former \nspouse, to continue to make payments after their 2018 divorce, is not supported by any \nadditional evidence. He admitted he did not track the debt, which was listed under his \naddress, to ensure the payments were being made. AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that \u201cthe \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d His intention to resolve the \nfinancial problem when his credit score improves is not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.b. He established a track record of debt \nrepayment and a responsible approach for this legal obligation under the terms of the \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is insufficient evidence that \nApplicant has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve \nthe delinquent status of his home equity loan. He listed the home equity loan in his \nbankruptcy and admitted that he stopped making payments in about 2017 or 2018 \nbecause he believed his former spouse had agreed to make the payments as part of their \ndivorce. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d Good faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acted in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation \nto resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns about his financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.b: \nConclusion\nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 6, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H. Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on June 10, 2023, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2024. The SOR was \namended on February 2, 2024, and Applicant responded to the amendment on March 1, \n2024. \nThe hearing was convened on April 10, 2024. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n3 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-L were admitted in evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s disclosure letter dated June 28, 2023, was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nI. Applicant testified and offered no additional evidence. Neither side requested to have \nthe record held open. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 19, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the amended allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.a, that he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about May 2017 to about March 2023, including while holding \na sensitive position, i.e., one in which he held an interim security clearance, and admitted \nand denied in part SOR \u00b6 1.b, that he expressed an intent to continue to use marijuana \nin the future during his September 2022 enhanced subject interview (ESI). \nApplicant is a 26-year-old project engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked \nfor his sponsor since 2022. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in December 2021. He is single but has a girlfriend whom he intends \nto marry. He has no children. (GE 1 at 12, 13, 30, and 37.) \nApplicant has a history of marijuana use. In his July 26, 2022 Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SCA), he reported using marijuana from May 2017 to July \n2022. He noted \u201cenjoyed consuming marijuana frequently between May 2017 and July \n2018\u201d but after 2018 he estimated he consumed about 15 times. He has not had any \nviolations while handling classified material while working for his sponsor under an interim \nsecurity clearance. (GE 3; Tr. at 40-41.) After the SOR was issued his interim security \nclearance was withdrawn. (Tr. at 43.) He stated on his July 2022 SCA he did \u201cnot intend \nto consume marijuana in the future because it still impacts [his] behavior in a negative \nway.\u201d (GE 1 at 39.)  \nAs part of the Government interrogatories, Applicant was asked to verify the \naccuracy of his September 2022 ESI. He made no changes and marked that the \ninformation he provided the investigator was accurate. (GE 2 at 6.) In his ESI, Applicant \ndiscussed with the investigator his future intent regarding marijuana use. He stated he \nmay keep trying it with friends to see if he likes it. The investigator asked if he knew what \nthe current policy at his current employment was regarding marijuana use, which he \nassumed it was not allowed but he was not aware. He told the investigator that he was \nliving with his girlfriend, and he would continue to try marijuana. He gave the investigator \nan example that if he was back at his apartment, he would still smoke it if he had energy \nafter he had been out drinking. He stated if people at work found out and he could not \nwork there, he would stop. (GE 2 at 4-5.) \nApplicant told the investigator that he stopped using marijuana in college and he \nhad not tried marijuana in over a year. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 55.) He then admitted he smoked \nmarijuana with his father in July 2022. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 49.) He testified that he used \nmarijuana in August 2022, March 2023, and in October 2023 to support his girlfriend. He \ndescribed the reason he smoked in August 2022 was to provide love and support after \nthey had moved into their new apartment. He used marijuana in October 2022 and March \n2023 to support his girlfriend because she was in an agitated state of mind. He testified \nto her mental health issues. She did not ask him to smoke with her on these occasions. \n(Tr. at 31-33, 44, 64.) His girlfriend possesses medical marijuana cards for two states. \n(AE E; Tr. at 30.) He offered two negative February 2024 drug tests that he privately \nsought. He testified he took the tests to \u201cput my money where my mouth is and prove that \n\n3 \n \nI can stay sober from marijuana.\u201d (AE C; Tr. at 38-39.) Both his father and girlfriend \ncontinue to smoke marijuana in his presence. (Tr. at 51, 52.) \nApplicant provided statements in support of his character (AE F), his performance \nevaluations with his sponsor (AE G), an award from his sponsor (AE H), and academic \nrecords (AE I). The documents reflect a high achiever who is well regarded. He offered \nhis Declaration of Intent dated April 26, 2023, abstaining from any future marijuana use \nand acknowledgement of the consequences for any future use and a Drug & Alcohol \nEducation Course Certificate of Completion dated March 29, 2024. (AE A; AE D.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n4 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA, Answer, and testimony are sufficient to raise \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25:  \n  (a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n\n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were  \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent and was not infrequent. He used marijuana with his \ngirlfriend multiple times on his own initiative to support her when she was in an agitated \nstate of mind. In doing so, Applicant knowingly disregarded security clearance eligibility \nstandards while holding an interim security clearance. He lives with his girlfriend who \ncontinues to use marijuana and his family uses marijuana as well. Given the familial \nrelationships, disassociation is problematic. While he offered negative drug tests taken in \nFebruary 2024 there has been insufficient time to establish if he has been able to create \nan environment where he will not again use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises \nsubstantial questions about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Applicant's \nwillingness to sign a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future does not \nmitigate the scope of these security concerns raised by his statements to the investigator \nconcerning his intentions for future use or his recent actions. Applicant has failed to fully \nestablish AG \u00b6 26 conditions that could mitigate the security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n6 \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered his character \nstatements, declaration of support of his girlfriend, and his miscellaneous awards as well \nas his Declaration of Intent and Drug & Alcohol Education Certificate of Completion. I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse). \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:   \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:     \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n   Subparagraphs 1.a-b: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 4, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The DOD acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2021. (This date is obviously incorrect, \nbut it is listed as such in her SOR answer.) She requested a hearing. The case was \nassigned to me on September 20, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 28, 2023, and the hearing was held on \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember 1, 2023, after initially being scheduled on October 31, 2023. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe Government\u2019s exhibit list and pre-hearing discovery letter were marked as hearing \nexhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified, offered the testimony of two witnesses, but \noffered no exhibits. The record closed at the completion of the hearing. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with some explanations concerning the \ndrug use allegations. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 24 years old. In May 2021, she graduated from college with a degree \nin mechanical engineering. She is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. 20, 41; \nGE 1-3) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from about February 2021 through about March 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that \nshe used marijuana in about July 2021, after being granted eligibility for access to \nclassified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on her March 2021 security clearance application (SCA) when she failed to \ndisclose her illegal drug use as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b above (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that she \ngave false information during her June 16, 2021 and July 27, 2021, background \ninterviews, when she initially denied any use of illegal drugs. After being confronted with \ninformation about her marijuana use, she admitted it as described in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b \nabove. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nApplicant began working for her current employer, a DOD contractor, in her full-\ntime position in August 2021. She had previously worked as a summer intern for this \nsame employer from June to August 2020, the summer between her junior and senior \nyears of college. She completed an SCA for the internship in February 2020 (GE 1) and \nwas granted a security clearance in late July 2020, shortly before her internship ended. \nShe also signed a classified nondisclosure agreement in June 2020 (GE 4). After her \nsummer internship ended, she was asked to stay on with her employer through her last \nyear of school as a part-time intern. All the work she performed during her summer \ninternship and her part-time internship involved unclassified material. She agreed to take \nthe part-time position and worked in this capacity from August 2020 to June 2021. She \nstopped working in July 2021 to have some time off before her full-time position started \nin August 2021. (Tr. 18-19, 31, 34; GE1-2) \nIn March 2021, Applicant completed a second SCA. In Section 23 of the SCA \ncovering past drug use or activity, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking if in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe past seven years, she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances. She also \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking if she had ever used illegal drugs while possessing \na security clearance. (GE 2) \nOn June 16, 2021, Applicant was telephonically interviewed by an investigator as \npart of her background check. She was asked about prior drug use and she answered \nthat she had no involvement with any illegal drugs, including marijuana, in her past. (GE \n3) \nOn July 27, 2021, Applicant was reinterviewed telephonically by the investigator \nabout her drug activity. She was asked if within the past seven years she had used any \nillegal drugs or controlled substances and she responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The investigator then \nconfronted Applicant with information developed during the investigation that she had \nused marijuana edibles early in 2021. Applicant acknowledged that use and explained it \nby saying she had blocked that time from her mind. She further explained that she went \nthrough a breakup with her boyfriend and was home alone and upset. She decided to \ningest several marijuana gummies (2-4) that her former boyfriend had given her. She \nwent on to explain that earlier in her relationship with the former boyfriend, which started \nin February 2021, she smoked marijuana with him one time. She also ate a marijuana \ngummy on one other occasion. Her relationship with her former boyfriend ended in March \n2023. Applicant claimed the reason she did not disclose this information when she was \nfirst interviewed was because she was nervous about the questions and just blurted out \n\u201cNo.\u201d (GE 3) \nThe investigator asked Applicant about any other drug involvement and she \nadmitted going on a picnic with friends in early July 2021, where she ate a marijuana \nedible offered by her friend. She acknowledged this use was after her initial interview with \nthe investigator on June 16, 2021. (GE 3) \nOn July 29, 2021, Applicant called the investigator to relay additional details about \nher marijuana use. She smoked marijuana about four times with her former boyfriend. \nShe ate edible forms of marijuana on two occasions. After her breakup with her boyfriend, \nshe consumed four edibles. All this marijuana use occurred in February and March 2021. \nApplicant further described her claimed last use of marijuana with her friends in early July \n2021. She also told the investigator that she initially failed to disclose this information \nbecause she \u201cfelt on the spot\u201d and she feared losing her job. (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing testimony was consistent with her later admissions of \nmarijuana use in February, March, and July 2021, as described above. She claimed her \nlast use of Marijuana was in July 2021. She also claimed she no longer associates with \npeople who use drugs. She stated she had no intentions to use marijuana in the future. \nShe further stated that she failed to disclose this information because she was scared of \nlosing her job and she did not want to disappoint her parents. On cross examination, \nApplicant admitted that, as early as her first summer internship, she knew marijuana use \nwas prohibited by her employer\u2019s drug policy. She had to take a drug test before she \nstarted that internship. (Tr. 21-24, 26-28, 30, 33; GE 5) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has matured since she began her full-time employment \nin August 2021. Specifically, she has better friends now who do not use illegal drugs. She \nhas a new boyfriend, and she has moved away from the location where her former friends \nlive. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant\u2019s two supervisors, one former and one current, testified for her at the \nhearing. Her former supervisor was in that position during 2021. She believes Applicant \nhandled classified information in an appropriate manner. She also opined that Applicant \nis reliable and trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor has been in that position since \nNovember 2022. He considers Applicant a good employee and has had no conduct or \nbehavioral issues with her. She handled classified information in an appropriate manner. \nHe is aware of the circumstances in this case and despite those, he has confidence in \nApplicant and believes that she should retain her security clearance. (Tr. 42-48, 62-64) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\u00ad\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in February and March 2021 is supported by her \nadmissions and other evidence. As for her admitted use of marijuana in July 2021, while \nshe held a security clearance at that time, there is no evidence that she had access to \nclassified information during the time of her marijuana use. On the contrary, the evidence \nestablished that she was on an employment break between her part-time internship, \nwhich ended in June 2021, and the beginning of her full-time employment, which began \nin August 2021. There is insufficient evidence to support that she used marijuana during \nthe time frame that she had access to classified information. I find only AG \u00b6 25(a) applies \nto both allegations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was not frequent, however, it was recent, with all use \noccurring in 2021. A troubling aspect of her marijuana use is that all it occurred after she \nwas granted a security clearance in June 2020. She admitted she knew what her \nemployer\u2019s drug policy was when she was hired as a summer intern during the summer \nof 2020 and that she was required to take a drug test at that time. Another troubling aspect \nof her marijuana use in July 2021, is that it came after she completed her second SCA in \nMarch 2021, after her first background interview with an investigator in June 2021, and \nbefore her second interview with the investigator on July 27, 2021, where she initially \ndenied all drug use. Her claimed recent abstinence is insufficient to convince me that \nrecurrence is unlikely. The recency of her past use, her use while holding a security \nclearance and, more specifically, after lying about her past marijuana use on multiple \noccasions, cast doubt upon her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) does not apply. While she may have distanced herself from her drug using \nfriends and stated her future intent not to use illegal drugs, she failed to present her intent \nin a written statement. While AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application, it is insufficient to \novercome her demonstrated unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant admitted that she deliberately provided false information on her March \n2021 SCA, and during her background investigation interviews on June 16, 2021 and July \n27, 2021. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after she was granted a security clearance, and her \nfailure to disclose that use on her March 2021 SCA and during her background interviews \ncause significant concerns. She was well aware of her responsibilities to disclose her drug \nuse in 2021, when she completed her SCA and during her interviews, but she failed to do \nso. She did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct her previous falsifications, \nrather it was only after she was confronted by the investigator, during the July 27, 2021 \ninterview, that she finally disclosed her past marijuana use. Deliberately providing false \ninformation on an SCA is not a minor offense. It strikes at the heart of the security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance investigation process. These actions raise questions about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Although Applicant claims she will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future, her credibility is suspect. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s youth, and the \nsupportive testimony of her supervisors. However, I also considered Applicant\u2019s history \nof marijuana use after obtaining a security clearance. She also deliberately falsified her \n2021 SCA and her interviews because she was afraid that she would lose her job if she \nwas truthful, thus putting her personal interests above being truthful to the Government. \nShe failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement and personal \nconduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He is 49 years old, married, and he has an adult child. He \ngraduated from high school in 1993 and attended various colleges from 1993 to 1995, in \n2004, and from 2006 to 2009, but he did not earn a degree. He received an aircraft \nmaintenance technician diploma in 1997, and he received numerous technical \ncertifications. He owned his first home from July 2004 to February 2014, and he has \nsince owned his second home. (Items 1-3, 7) \nApplicant has worked in the information technology field since 1997. He worked \nfor a DOD contractor overseas from December 2010 to July 2014, and he worked for \nanother DOD contractor from July 2021 to at least the date of his May 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA). He was self-employed from August 2014 to at least May \n2022, and he was unemployed from around March 2020 to October 2020. Since March \n2023, he has worked as an independent contractor network consultant for his employer, \na DOD contractor. He was first granted a security clearance in 2010. (Items 1-3, 7-8) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had eight delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$187,376 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.i) and a medical account in collection for $3,043 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d). The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, May \n2022 security clearance application (SCA), June 2022 background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator, November 2022 response to interrogatories, and credit \nbureau reports from June 2022, November 2022, February 2023, and July 2023. (Items \n1-8) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his failed house-flipping business he \nstarted with a business partner. He obtained large personal loans from 2018 to 2020 to \nfund the business. When he elected not to close on a property after deciding it was not \na worthwhile project because the property had a lien, he utilized the loan money to pay \nhis credit cards. He was financially overextended. (Items 2-3, 7-8) \nApplicant stated that the COVID-19 pandemic halted any further business, and \nhe was furloughed by his employer, a private company, in March 2020. He stated in his \nAnswer that his business ultimately failed when his partner became ill and subsequently \npassed away. He used the equity from the sale of his first home to settle some of his \ndebts upon obtaining employment. Although he considered resolving his debts through \na debt consolidation plan in approximately September 2019, as well as other debt relief \nprograms, he did not finalize any of those options. With his current employment as an \nindependent contractor, he stated in his response to interrogatories that he is required \n\u201cto pay for all expenses traveling and working to be reimbursed 30 days later.\u201d He \nconsequently has to \u201cbe careful with my finances and make payments that are \nmanageable for my debts.\u201d (Items 2-3, 7-8) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer that he had monthly payment arrangements of \n$277, $50, $50, and $243, respectively, to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and \n1.g, which total $113,351. He made the following payments in accordance with these \narrangements: for SOR \u00b6 1.a, he made a $100 payment in May 2023 and five monthly \npayments of $277 from June 2023 to October 2023; for SOR \u00b6 1.e, he made a $50 \npayment in May 2023; for SOR \u00b6 1.f, he made a $50 payment in May 2023; and for \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, he made a $116 payment in January 2019 and a $243 payment in May \n2023. He intended to increase his monthly payments for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g once \nhe had the financial means to do so. (Items 2, 7] \nApplicant also stated in his Answer that he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, \nbut he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. He stated that he was \nawaiting correspondence from the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he did not provide proof of \npayment. Although he provided a copy of a return receipt for correspondence that he \nmailed to an attorney for the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d, such documentation does not reflect \nthat he paid this debt. He intended to continue resolving these debts. (Items 2, 7) \nApplicant also stated in his Answer that he contacted the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nand that he was in the process of negotiating a payment arrangement to resolve this \ndebt. He intended to resolve this debt. He also stated that he contacted the creditor for \nSOR \u00b6 1.i to negotiate a payment arrangement, but that he had not received a \nresponse. He intended to continue trying to resolve this debt. (Item 2) \nApplicant also stated in his Answer that he had been paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h. He acknowledged that he did not have documentation to corroborate his claim of \npayment. He intended to continue resolving this debt. (Item 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary as of his Answer was $115,000. In November 2022, he \nestimated that he and his spouse\u2019s combined net monthly income was $10,600, and \ntheir monthly net remainder after expenses, which included some of the SOR debts, \nwas $3,546. He signed a statement of intent to \u201calways pay my debts to maintain \nfinancial stability,\u201d and that any failure to do so would result in the automatic revocation \nof his clearance. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant received any financial \ncounseling. He stated that he takes his security clearance responsibilities seriously, no \nmatter his financial status. (Items 2, 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. \nHowever, Applicant failed to show that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. \nHe failed to show a track record of consistent payments, in accordance with his \npayment arrangements, for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. He did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.d, and 1.h. He failed to provide proof of his efforts to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.i. There is no evidence that he has received credit counseling. There are not \nclear indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not \nestablished. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non June 29, 2023. The case was assigned to me on July 6, 2023. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July 17, 2023. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on September 19, 2023. The Government offered Government \nExhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through S. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 28, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 59-year-old senior systems engineer with a defense contractor. He \nhas worked for the company since November 2022. He previously owned or was \nemployed by another defense contractor from 1999 until approximately 2022. He is \ndivorced with four children. He currently has a girlfriend who he lives with. Applicant has \nreceived a bachelor of science degree. He is seeking to retain a security clearance \ngranted in approximately 2000 in connection with his work with the DoD.

During those times he was employed by a defense contractor and \nheld a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 3; Applicant Exhibit H.) \nApplicant has suffered from severe stomach pains for several years, starting in \napproximately 2019. He submitted his medical records showing his attempts to resolve \nthis issue with various doctors during that time. The pain, while not constant, was often \ndebilitating. On two different occasions in 2021, in different states and with different \npeople other than his girlfriend, he was offered and used very small amounts of marijuana \nthat he believed would be good for his pain. He discovered it did not help with his pain \nissues and stopped the use after the second time. He has not used marijuana since that \ntime and evinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. He admits that his \ntwo-time use of marijuana was foolish and against Government policy and that of his \nemployer. He stated that this experimentation was brought about by his continuing \nabdominal pain and frustration with the inability of normal medicine to resolve it.

(Government Exhibit 3; \nApplicant Exhibit H; Tr. 30-48, 56-74.) \nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana on an e-QIP that he filled out in July 2021. \nThis was two months after the last of his two uses. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; \nGovernment Exhibit 3; Tr. 44-45.) \nApplicant submitted recent negative drug-test results. He also submitted a signed \nstatement of \u201chis intent never to use illegal drugs again.\u201d The statement also declared, \n\u201cShould there be any violation with regard to illegal drug use, I hereby consent to \nautomatic revocation of my security clearance.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits Q and R.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or \nunreliability. Specifically, the Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant\u2019s drug-\nuse history, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nHe denied the single allegation under this paragraph with explanations. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted in part and denied in part the single allegation under this guideline with \nexplanations. \nThis allegation concerned a lawsuit that was filed by the State A government \nagainst Applicant and 3,500 other people in 2021. This lawsuit was filed in connection \nwith a grant that was given to Applicant and others due to a devastating natural disaster \nthat occurred in 2005. The lawsuit was not due to misconduct by Applicant, but rather to \nthe misconduct of a contractor hired by State A to manage the grant program. The lawsuit \nwas eventually resolved with the contractor paying the State A government over $100 \nmillion. State A dismissed the lawsuit filed against Applicant with prejudice at plaintiff\u2019s \ncosts in March 2023. A conformed copy of the order of dismissal is attached as Applicant \nExhibit S. (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant Exhibits E and P; Tr. 48-55.) \nMitigation \nLetters of recommendation were submitted by Applicant\u2019s coworkers and personal \nfriends.

(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 62.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant used marijuana twice in 2021, while he was employed in the defense \nindustry and held a security clearance. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant experimentally used marijuana twice in 2021. This was a result of his \ncontinuing medical issues and the inability of his doctors to control it. This conduct was in \nthe past and has not been repeated. Applicant thoroughly understands the consequences \nof any future drug use or exposure, and has taken several steps to avoid it. He has \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent. Viewing his extremely minor marijuana use in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his past \ndrug involvement. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use was infrequent, in the \npast, and he evinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. He has mitigated \nthe single allegation under this guideline. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant was a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the State A government in \nconnection to a grant given to him due to a devastating natural disaster. The evidence is \nclear that the lawsuit was not due to misconduct of Applicant, but of a State A contractor. \nWhile the disqualifying conditions are minimally applicable, the negative inference is more \nthan overcome by the evidence showing the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice \non the motion of the State A government. The mitigating conditions apply, and this \nallegation is also found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his \nminor drug use and the lawsuit brought against him by State A. His forthright disclosures \nminimized or eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. Continuation or \nrecurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence does not create any \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 9, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on February 21, 2023, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 26, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on October \n27, 2023, scheduling the matter for a hearing on November 17, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. At the hearing, I admitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 without objection. Applicant testified and he did not call any \nwitnesses or present any documentation. I kept the record open until December 1, 2023, \n1 \n\nto enable him to submit documentation. He did not do so and the record closed. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f, and 1.h-1.i and he denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. He is 37 years old. He has never married and he has two children, \nages 11 and 9. He graduated from high school in 2010 and attended college part time in \nFebruary 2012 and from January 2017 to January 2018 but did not earn a degree. He \nhas lived with his mother since 2021. (Tr. 6-7, 24-28, 57-59, 69-71; GE 1-2) \nApplicant worked for non-defense contractors as a medical secretary from 2010 to \n2018, an office manager from 2018 to 2019, a security site manager from 2019 to 2020, \na security lieutenant from 2020 to 2021, a concierge and then a leasing manager from \n2021 to 2022, a restaurant chef from 2022 to 2023, and a chef for a private company \nsince September 2023. He was unemployed for three months in 2013 and again in 2018. \nSince 2020, he has also worked as a consultant for his employer, a defense contractor. \nHe has never held a security clearance. (Tr. 7-8, 28-32, 52, 66-67, 71-79; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$19,609 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-h) and $12,000 in child support arrears (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The SOR \nallegations are established by his admissions in his Answer; his February 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA); his March 2022 interview with an authorized DOD \nbackground investigator; his October 2022 response to interrogatories; and credit bureau \nreports (CBR) from March 2022, November 2022, January 2023, and November 2023. \n(GE 1-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a debt buyer account placed for collection in the amount of $5,201. \nApplicant used this account when he worked for a previous employer to purchase \nelectronics. He paid the account through automatic deductions from his paycheck and \nwas unaware that he had an outstanding balance until he was contacted by the creditor \nin approximately 2020. He made monthly payments of $100 at unrecalled dates but \nstopped because he could no longer afford to do so. As of the date of the hearing, he had \nnot contacted the creditor to try to resolve this debt. (Tr. 31-36, 79-80; GE 4, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a $586 charged-off online retail account. Applicant believed he paid \nthis debt in 2021. When he learned during his March 2022 background interview that he \nhad an outstanding balance of approximately $500, he telephoned the creditor to \ndetermine its status. He stated that the creditor informed him that he had a zero balance \nbut he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. Although this debt is \nreported on the January 2023 and November 2023 CBRs with a zero balance, both CBRs \nalso reflect that this account was charged off in the amount of $586. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 36-40, 80-82; GE 4, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $9,174 charged-off auto loan. Applicant obtained this auto loan in \n2012 to purchase a car. His car was involuntarily repossessed in approximately 2013 \nbecause he could no longer afford to make his monthly car payments. He believed he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nresolved this debt when the creditor sold the car at auction and applied the proceeds to \nhis remaining loan balance. When he learned during his March 2022 background \ninterview that he still owed this debt, he contacted the creditor and entered into a payment \narrangement of $380 monthly. He made payments of $174 and $375 in October 2022 \nand November 2022, respectively, but he has not since made any payments. This debt \nis not resolved. (Tr. 39-43, 82-84; GE 2-3, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a cellular account placed for collection in the amount of $1,912. \nApplicant cosigned this account for his ex-fianc\u00e9e and her children. He was unaware that \nit had an outstanding balance until his March 2022 background interview. He has not \ncontacted the creditor to resolve this debt. (Tr. 43-44, 84-86; GE 2, 4-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a music store account placed for collection in the amount of $1,110. \nApplicant opened this account so that his ex-girlfriend could purchase a violin for her child. \nWhen they parted ways, his ex-girlfriend was supposed to pay this debt but she did not. \nHe stated that he telephoned the creditor in February 2023 and was informed that he had \na zero balance but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. This debt \nis unresolved. (Tr. 44-45, 86; GE 2-3, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $732 charged-off credit card. Applicant could not recall when he last \nmade a payment toward this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 45-50, 86-87; GE 2, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a cellular account placed for collection in the amount of $651. \nApplicant was unsure why he had an outstanding balance because he has a cellular \naccount with this creditor that is current. He has not contacted the creditor to determine \nthe status of this debt and it is unresolved. (Tr. 48-49, 87; GE 2-3, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a $243 charged-off credit card. Applicant stated that he made an \nunspecified number of payments of $20 toward this debt and he last made such a \npayment in March 2023. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim of \npayments and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 45-51, 87-88; GE 4-5, 7) \nApplicant incurred $12,000 in child support arrears (SOR \u00b6 1.i) when a child \nsupport order was issued in 2019 for his nine-year-old child. Aside from a few missed \npayments when he was unemployed in 2018, he stated that he has consistently paid this \nchild support obligation through automatic pay deductions of $1,000 monthly, of which \n$400 is applied to his arrears. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim \nof payments toward these arrears. (Tr. 25-27, 51-53, 59-69) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to his periods of unemployment, minimal \nincome, and his child support obligations. In addition to the child support arrears in SOR \n\u00b6 1.i, Applicant was ordered in 2018 to pay child support for his 11-year-old child, which \nincluded $7,000 in arrears. He stated that he paid this child support obligation through an \nautomatic pay deduction of $975 monthly until 2019, when it was modified to $600 \nmonthly, of which $150 was applied to his arrears. He stated that he paid this obligation \nuntil 2021, when the child support enforcement agency stopped the order at the request \nof the child\u2019s mother. She and Applicant agreed that she would make such a request \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause he could not afford the payments, but he would financially contribute when he \nhad the ability to do so. He stated that he resolved the arrearage through monthly \npayments of $380 until September 2023. (Tr. 25-32, 42, 44, 50-79, 81, 84, 88-91; GE 1-\n3) \nApplicant earned approximately $48,000 annually before 2020. As a DOD \nconsultant, he earned an annual income of $5,000 in 2020 and $10,000 in 2021 and 2022; \nhe had not yet earned an income in 2023 due to a lack of work. In his non-DOD \nemployment, he earned an annual income of approximately $40,000 from 2020 to 2021; \n$60,000 in 2022; and $65,000 until September 2023, when his annual salary dropped to \n$38,000. He stated that he did not have much of a monthly net remainder after \ncontributing $1,700 for rent, and that his mother provided him with financial assistance. \nHe estimated that he had $200 in his combined checking and savings accounts. He did \nnot have a retirement savings account. He spoke with a debt consolidation company in \n2020 but elected not to pursue it. He has not received credit counseling. (Tr. 27-32, 42, \n44, 50, 52-59, 69-79, 81, 84, 88-91; GE 1-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. Although Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his claim of payments toward his child support arrears SOR \n\u00b6 1.i, he incurred these arrears immediately upon issuance of the child support order in \n2019. In addition, except for a few missed payments during his 2018 period of \nunemployment, he stated that he has consistently paid his child support obligation since \nthe order was issued. He has done so through automatic pay deductions of $1,000 \nmonthly, of which $400 is applied to his arrears. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply to \nSOR \u00b6 1.i and I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has either not made efforts to resolve or did not provide documentation \nto corroborate any of his claims of payment or resolution for the remaining SOR debts. \nHe has not received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has \nhis finances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2009. In May \n2023, as part of government interrogatories, he authenticated the accuracy of the \nsummary of his February 2009 interview. During his interview, he reported he had been \narrested five times for DUI in the past and that he had a drinking problem for the past 25 \nyears. At the time, he said he was attempting to reduce his alcohol consumption, and he \nhad reduced it since his 2006 DUI arrest when he consumed four or five beers prior to \nriding his motorcycle before he was arrested. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless \ndriving after he completed the terms of his sentence. (Items 4, 7, 10) \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator a 2001 DUI arrest. He said he had \nconsumed alcohol to excess and was involved in an accident. He was uncertain as to \nhow much he had consumed, but he believed it was between six and nine beers over a \ntwo-to-three-hour period. He told the investigator the charges were dismissed due to a \ntechnicality. (Items 4, 10) \nApplicant discussed with the investigator a 1993 or 1994 DUI arrest after \nconsuming alcohol to excess, when he was stopped by police for speeding. He paid a \nfine and performed community service. He further disclosed he was arrested for DUI in \n1989 after he consumed alcohol to excess and had used marijuana. He was sentenced \nto 30 days in jail. He also disclosed he was arrested for DUI in 1986 but could not recall \nthe details. (Item 4, Item 10 page 3) \nApplicant told the investigator said he had consumed six to nine beers on average \nthree to four times a week prior to 2006 when he was last arrested for DUI. Since then, \nhe consumed two to three beers two to three times a week. He uses alcohol to relax and \nenjoys drinking beer after work. He considered himself an alcoholic in the past but did not \nat the time of his 2009 security interview.

He said because he was newly married with children he can not \nbe intoxicated when he cares for his children. His intention at that time was to continue to \nconsume alcohol socially. (Item 10 page 4) \nOn August 18, 2021, Applicant voluntarily sought alcohol treatment and \nparticipated in an inpatient program until September 9, 2021. A response for his medical \nrecords is dated September 2022. The treating physician stated at the time of discharge \nfrom treatment in September 2021, that Applicant was \u201cin remission of his symptoms at \ndischarge. Conditions of symptoms are unknown to us since then.\u201d His prognosis was \npositive. (Item 9 page 18) Applicant provided a statement with his August 2022 \ninterrogatories. He said, \u201cI do not drink alcohol. I got carried away with my drinking during \nthe COVID lock down and working from home. I have corrected that now.\u201d The statement \nis undated. (Item 9) \nApplicant\u2019s inpatient treatment records show he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use \nDisorder by a qualified medical professional. He disclosed to the doctor that he was self-\nreferring for treatment after years of heavy alcohol consumption and unsuccessful \nattempts to quit. He provided a history of his past alcohol abuse which began with heavy \ndrinking in 2012. He consumed a six-pack of beer (12 ounces) together with a half bottle \nof hard liquor daily. This pattern continued for seven years uninterrupted. In 2019, he tried \nto quit alcohol consumption on and off unsuccessfully. In 2020, he was able to stop \nalcohol consumption for six months. He told the doctor that he attended AA for six to eight \nweeks, but he did not benefit from it. He started consuming alcohol again after six months \nof sobriety. His consumption gradually and then drastically increased. Upon admission \ninto the treatment program, he was consuming a six-pack of beer plus a half bottle of hard \nliquor each day during the weekend and a reduced amount two to three days during the \nweek. He reported his drinking was causing significant problems with his family and work \nwith the potential of separation/divorce from his wife and unemployment. Prior to \nadmission, Applicant reported he had been drinking heavily for four days straight. (Items \n9, 10) \nApplicant was in a locked unit for assessment, detoxification, and monitoring of \nwithdrawal symptoms. He was provided medication to help him with his withdrawal \nsymptoms. After he was medically stable and his withdrawal symptoms improved, the \nmedication was discontinued, and he was transferred to an open unit to \u201cstart a rigorous \nsubstance use treatment.\u201d The report of treatment stated that he was integrated into a \nmultimodal treatment program which included intensive psychotherapy, occupational \ntherapy, art therapy, and physiotherapy, as well as medical optimization, daily visits by \nthe psychiatry team, and a through medical evaluation to rule out medical diagnoses. \n(Items 9, 10) \nThe treatment report stated that Applicant\u2019s intervention followed a substance use \nspecific protocol, which targeted cessation, maintenance of abstinence, and relapse \nprevent. (emphasis added) Acamprosate was added to his medication regime to aid with \nreported cravings. The treatment report further stated:  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUpon discharge, [Applicant] denies cravings and urges to drink, as well as \nwithdrawal symptoms. He expressed confidence in his ability to maintain \nabstinence and use relapse prevention strategies. We recommend that \nhe continue taking Acamprosate to help with cravings and use the \nskills that he learned during admission to maintain abstinence. We \nrecommend he follows-up with outpatient psychotherapy as needed and/or \nat least once every three months to aid in his recovery. (emphasis \nadded) (Item 10 page 28) \nAdditional notes from the treatment report for Applicant\u2019s inpatient treatment \nstated:  \nWe discharged [Applicant] to his home on 02.09.2021 without any indication \nof acute danger to himself or others and free of suicidal tendencies. We \nrecommend the continuation of the medication with regular checks of \nthe associated laboratory parameters and the ECG in the context of \nregular check-ups by general practitioners and neurologist. (emphasis \nadded) (Item 10 page 30)  \nIn August 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. He was asked if \nhe currently consumed any alcohol and he responded \u201cno.\u201d (Item 9 page 2) He was asked \nwhy he stopped drinking and he stated: \nI started to drink more often and a little more than I should have during the \nCOVID 19 lock down. I stopped because I love my family and wife. I decided \nto take alcohol out of the equation and stop drinking for a healthier family \nlifestyle. (Item 9 page 2)  \nApplicant further disclosed he was taking medication to help him abstain from \ndrinking on an as needed basis. When asked if he intended to consume alcoholic \nbeverages in the future, he responded \u201cno.\u201d He disclosed he had inpatient alcohol \ntreatment from August 2021 to September 2021 and his aftercare was \u201cas needed\u201d and \nthere was no follow-up required. He reported his last consumption of alcohol was in \nNovember or December 2021. This consumption was after his inpatient treatment. (Item \n9) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories on May 7, 2023.

Prior \nto the altercation, it is alleged he consumed approximately four to five beers over the \ncourse of a couple hours. He explained in his SOR answer that the district attorney \ndeclined to file charges or to prosecute because there was insufficient evidence. He \nadmitted he had a marital dispute and the police arrived and it was clear someone was \ngoing to jail, which was him. The police report shows his wife called the police because \nshe was scared. She later refused to cooperate and testify so the case was dismissed. In \nhis 2009 background interview, he admitted to consuming four to five beers before the \nincident. (Items 4, 10 at page 6) \nApplicant denied in his August 2023 answer to the SOR, the allegation in \u00b6 1.h \nwhich alleged that he received inpatient treatment from about August 2021 to September \n2021 for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder. Upon discharge it was \nrecommended that he continue to take prescribed medication to help cravings of alcohol \nand to abstain from consuming alcohol. In his SOR answer, he admitted he received \ninpatient treatment in 2021. He said at discharge he was advised to take his medication \nfor a period of time after discharge, but not to take it indefinitely. He explained the \nmedication prescribed, Acamprosate, is not for long term use. He was advised to take it \nas needed to curb his alcohol cravings. He further stated: \u201cThe issue was stopping the \ndrinking, and that happened. More importantly, I have continued to attend A[lcoholics] \nA[nonymous] meetings online and have used Celebrate Recovery study aids.\u201d (Item 2) \nThe treatment report as noted above states he was to abstain from alcohol consumption \nand follow-up as needed or at least every three months. (Item 2) \nApplicant denied in his SOR answer \u00b6 1.i which alleged in approximately \nDecember 2021 he resigned in lieu of being terminated from employment after his \nsupervisor allegedly smelled alcohol on his breath when he reported to work. He \nexplained in his SOR answer that he was forced to resign because his supervisor made \nfalse allegations against him, and he did not want the allegations to negatively impact \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhim. He adamantly denied the allegation. He told his supervisor that he did not drink on \nthe day in question and the person he was with that day provided a statement confirming \nthat while in his presence, he did not observe Applicant consuming alcohol. Applicant \nstated he was not afforded the opportunity to defend himself or take a blood test to prove \nhis innocence, which he believed would have exonerated him. He believes his supervisor \nwas looking for an excuse to fire him because his employer had tried to reduce his wages \nwhen he was in a contract for a specific wage. There is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat Applicant consumed alcohol that day. I find in his favor on this allegation. (Item 2) \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and part of 1.h that alleged that he continues to \nconsume alcohol, and that he has failed to take his prescribed medication to help alcohol \ncravings and abstention in accordance with his treatment advice and recommendations. \n(Item 2) \nApplicant stated in his August 2023 SOR answer, \u201cI will admit that [I] struggled in \nthe past and currently struggle with alcohol, I am an alcoholic and I must work every day \nto keep my sobriety. I drink occasionally if we have an event to attend, I will have a beer \nor glass of wine.\u201d In addition, he stated: \u201cI am doing what I was taught and keeping myself \nsober from excessive alcohol use.\u201d \u201cI will admit it is a daily struggle, but it is one that I am \nwinning and will continue to win.\u201d He further stated: \nI attended inpatient treatment, I have followed that up with continued after \ncare treatment including AA meetings and the Celebrate Recovery \nprogram. I made the requisite changes and have not had any other law \nenforcement involvement. This is a clear change from the previous pattern \nof DUIs. (Item 2) \nApplicant did not provide any supporting evidence that he is abstaining from \nalcohol, attends AA, or is in a recovery program. His attorney provided a brief in response \nto the FORM. It is dated November 17, 2023. Included and attached to the brief is an \naffidavit from Applicant dated November 17, 2022. I believe this is a typographical error \nand the affidavit is from 2023. In the affidavit, Applicant \nstates the following: \nI am in compliance with the treatment that has been recommended to me \nby medical professionals for my previously-diagnosed alcohol use disorder.  \nI have been given permission to drink alcohol in reasonable amounts from \nmy medical providers, based on the success of my treatment for alcohol \nuse disorder. \nI no longer have cravings for alcohol. \nI am currently abstaining from using alcohol, and I am willing to continue to \ndo so if the Administrative Judge believes it is the best way to minimize any \nsecurity risks I may pose.

He did not provide any \ncorroborating documentation showing a treatment plan by a medical professional for his \npreviously diagnosed alcohol use disorder and that it permits him to consume alcohol. \nThe only treatment plan submitted was that from his 2021 in-patient treatment. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol\nuse disorder;  \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThere is substantial evidence1 to conclude that in about 1983 Applicant was \narrested and charged with public intoxication after the police found alcohol in his vehicle, \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

In around January 1993, October 2001, and \nApril 2006, he was arrested and charged with DUI. In about May 2008, he was arrested \nand charged with battery-domestic violence following an altercation with his wife after he \nhad consumed four to five beers over the course of a couple hours. He received inpatient \ntreatment from August 2021 to September 2021 and was diagnosed with Alcohol Abuse \nDisorder by a qualified medical professional. Upon discharge it was recommended he \ncontinue taking his prescribed medication to help with alcohol cravings and to abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption. He continues to consume alcohol and has failed to adhere to \nthe treatment advice and aftercare recommendations. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nI find there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant was drinking before \nhe was terminated from his employment. I find in his favor in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAfter completing inpatient treatment and understanding the goal of his treatment \nwas abstinence, Applicant\u2019s treatment report stated: \n[Applicant] expressed confidence in his ability to maintain abstinence and \nuse relapse prevention strategies.

Applicant was to remain abstinent. Consistent with \nhis past history, he stops consuming alcohol for a period, but then resumes. He has \nprovided statements to the government saying he is not consuming alcohol only to be \nfollowed by later statements saying he is consuming alcohol. \nThe evidence does not support that Applicant has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. He did not provide current objective information or documentary proof \nthat he is participating in counseling, treatment, or attending AA. The evidence shows he \nhas a history of abstinence and then relapses. Although, he acknowledges his problems \nwith alcohol, he has also provided inconsistent statement as to his willingness to abstain. \nHe believes he can continue to consume alcohol, but also promises to abstain. This is \ninconsistent with his treatment plan. He has been suffering for years with alcohol \ndependency and based on his history, it is likely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s latest statement says he is permitted to use alcohol, but he will abstain \nin order to maintain his security clearance. He admitted to consuming alcohol as late as \nApril 2023. In addition, based on his repeated relapses, it is too soon to conclude another \nrelapse is unlikely to recur. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about whether he continues to \nconsume alcohol, his attendance at AA, his adherence to his treatment plan, and other \nmatters to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. \n01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). I find none of the Guideline G mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

He has two children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 22, 92-93; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant served in the Reserve from about 2012 until he was separated in about \n2016 or 2017 with a general under honorable conditions discharge for unsatisfactory \nparticipation. He admitted that he missed some drills, but it was because of financial \nissues, and he could not afford the transportation to his drills. He asked to be activated \nto active duty so that he would not have the transportation costs, and his finances would \nimprove. That request was not granted, and he was separated. (Tr. at 20-22, 34-47, 86-\n87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant \nwent \nthrough \nextended \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment after he was discharged from the military in 2012.

(GE 1, 2) \nApplicant worked as a cook for a defense contractor overseas from about late \n2017 through March 2019. He worked as a cook in the United States, not in the defense \nindustry, from about April 2019 through September 2019. He returned overseas and \nworked for another defense contractor from about September 2019 to October or \nNovember 2020. He was unemployed for a time, and then he drove for a rideshare \ncompany from about early 2021 until the summer of 2021 when he started working for a \ndefense contractor on a military installation in the United States. Applicant moved to a \nforeign country in September 2021 to work for a defense contractor on a military \ninstallation. He worked there until May 2023 when he had to leave because he did not \nhave a security clearance. He was unemployed until he found a job in a restaurant in \nNovember 2023. He stated in his post-hearing submission that he lost his job a week \nafter his hearing. His former defense contractor employer will rehire him and send him \noverseas to work on a military installation if he receives a security clearance.

He was cited in August 2023 with, among other violations, \nunknowingly operating a vehicle while driver\u2019s license suspended, cancelled, or \nrevoked. He was not cited for failure to maintain liability insurance. He paid a fine. His \nlicense was replaced in September 2023, and is currently valid.

His IRS wage and income transcript showed $99 and \n$4,898 in wages, tips, and other compensation from wage and tax statements (W-2s) \nfrom two employers. His second employer withheld $320 in income taxes; $303 for \nSocial Security; and $71 for Medicare. If there was no other income, Applicant would \nnot have been required to file a federal income tax return for 2017. (Tr. at 47-53; GE 2; \nHE I; AE A, B) \nApplicant did not file his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal income tax returns when \nthey were due (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He reported in his August 2020 Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) that he failed to file a tax return in 2019, because he was \nworking out of the country and \u201cjust completely forgot about it.\u201d He was interviewed for \nher background investigation in December 2020. He told the investigator that he did not \nfile his 2018 and 2019 returns because he thought he was tax exempt from working \noverseas. He told the investigator that he intended to file his 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax \nreturns by April 2021. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant did not file his 2018 through 2020 tax returns by April 2021.The IRS \nprepared a substitute tax return for 2018 in July 2022. An IRS account transcript from \nMarch 2023 indicated that based on the substitute return, he owed the IRS $23,556 in \ntaxes, penalties, and interest for 2018. Applicant retained a tax professional to prepare \nhis tax returns. Applicant filed his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal income tax returns in \nMarch 2023. Because of the amount of foreign income, his 2018 return indicated that he \ndid not owe the IRS; his 2019 return indicated that he was due a refund of $366; and his \n2020 return indicated that he was due a refund of $1,999. (Tr. at 53-54; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant has not filed his 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2022 (not alleged) income tax \nreturns. He plans on having the same tax professional prepare the returns. (Tr. at 57-\n58, 87-88; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nThe SOR originally alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling about $32,350. After 2 \ndebts totaling about $4,940 were withdrawn because they were paid, the SOR alleges \n12 delinquent debts totaling about $27,420. The debts are listed on one or more credit \nreports from August 2020, December 2022, and January 2024. Some of the debts have \nbeen paid. \nApplicant has not paid the $17,368 defaulted auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), but he \nstated the balance on the auto loan was $4,606. He fell behind on the payments, and he \nlet the mother of his children drive the vehicle while he was overseas, and she got in a \nminor accident. The vehicle also needed maintenance. It was repaired and maintenance \nperformed, incurring a bill of about $6,000 or $7,000. Nobody paid the bill. The auto \nrepair shop had a mechanic\u2019s lien on the vehicle and eventually sold it to recoup its \ncharges. The debt is listed on all three credit reports in evidence, with the most recent \nreport listing the balance as $20,747. The original creditor apparently did not receive \nanything from the sale.

The \n$996 debt is listed on all three credit reports in evidence. Applicant thought the VA paid \nthe college. He did not submit any documentation establishing that the $996 debt has \nbeen paid.

(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5-7; AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems including delinquent debts and \nincome tax returns that were not timely filed. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nApplicant did not file a federal income tax return for 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), but the \nGovernment did not establish by substantial evidence that he was required to file a \nreturn. The language in SOR \u00b6 1.a relating to tax year 2017 is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended in about March 2023 for failure to \nmaintain liability insurance on his vehicle. (SOR \u00b6 1.q). He was working overseas at the \ntime, not driving the vehicle, and he did not realize that he needed to maintain the \ninsurance. He was cited in August 2023 with, among other violations, unknowingly \noperating a vehicle while driver\u2019s license suspended, cancelled, or revoked. He was not \ncited for failure to maintain liability insurance. He paid a fine. His license was replaced in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSeptember 2023, and is currently valid. Any financial considerations security concerns \nraised by his failure to maintain liability insurance are mitigated. SOR \u00b6 1.q is concluded \nfor Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant \nwent \nthrough \nextended \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment after he was discharged from the military in 2012. He told a \nbackground investigator in December 2020 that he intended to file his 2018, 2019, and \n2020 tax returns by April 2021. He did not file his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal income \ntax returns until March 2023. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to those years. He still has not \nfiled his returns for 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2022 (not alleged). He plans on having the \nsame tax professional prepare the returns. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). This is true even when the tax returns are eventually filed. \nApplicant paid $3,546 in October 2020 to satisfy a judgment that was previously \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He paid $1,118 to a credit union in October 2020 for the $1,398 \ndebt that was previously alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He paid four of the SOR debts totaling \nabout $1,513 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j). The four paid debts are mitigated. He \ndisputed owing five debts totaling about $2,655 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p) for \nvarious reasons. I am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt, and I find those debts \nare also mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved. However, he still owes three debts totaling \nabout $23,250 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.k), and he has not yet filed his federal tax \nreturns for 2021 and 2022. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. His \nfailure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his debts continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was separated from the Reserve in about 2016 \nwith a general under honorable conditions discharge for unsatisfactory participation. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges that Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended in about March \n2023 for failure to maintain liability insurance on his vehicle. His conduct raises security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), and 16(e). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is old, minor, or both. It does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for tax \nyear 2017, which is found For \nApplicant) \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.q: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Since then, he has worked as a security officer for a fourth defense contractor. \nHe was first granted a security clearance in 2022. (Tr. 6-11, 28-33, 53-56, 63-64; GE 1; \nAE B) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 17 delinquent federal student loans, totaling \n$111,769 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.q); a credit card in collection for $456 (SOR \u00b6 1.r); and a city \ndebt in collection for $210 (SOR \u00b6 1.s). Each of the SOR allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit bureau reports from June 2022 and January 2023. \n(GE 1, 3-4) \nApplicant attributed his indebtedness to a variety of factors, including his \nunderemployment and unemployment, the extraordinary expenses associated with \nrelocating to State B, and his financial illiteracy, particularly with respect to his student \nloans. Since August 2021, he has resided in State B with his sister, an elementary school \nteacher, who financially supported him while he was unemployed. (Tr. 27-28, 30-31, 33, \n36-38, 56, 58-63, 73-74) \nApplicant used the student loans to pay for his college and graduate school \nexpenses. Until he received correspondence from the U.S. Department of Education \n(DOE) concerning his student loans in about 2019 or 2020, he had neither made a \npayment nor initiated any contact with the DOE. At that time, he made one payment of an \nunrecalled amount toward his student loans, which he maintained was all that he could \nthen afford. He attributed his prior inaction to his financial illiteracy. On an unrecalled date, \nhe unsuccessfully applied for the student loan forgiveness program. He was not required \nto make any payments during the COVID-19 payment pause. (Tr. 36-50, 61, 64-67, 72-\n78; AE A-B) \n2 \n\nWhen Applicant completed his June 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he \nlearned that his unresolved student loans raised security concerns. On an unspecified \ndate, he contacted the DOE and made an unspecified payment, in an amount under $100. \nOn another unspecified date, sometime after he received the SOR in February 2023, he \ncontacted the DOE again. At that time, his student loans, which were not then in \ndelinquent status due to the COVID-19 payment pause, had been transferred to two \nservice providers: Companies A and B. He set up two separate monthly payment \narrangements in the amounts of $64 and $151, respectively, scheduled to begin in \nOctober 2023. He made a $50 good-faith payment to Company A in June 2023 and three \nmonthly payments of $64 between October 2023 and November 2023. After some \nconfusion on his part as to whether Company B was the same as Company A, he paid \nCompany B $157 in November 2023. He maintained that has the financial means to meet \nboth monthly payment obligations until his student loans are resolved. (Tr. 36-50, 61, 64-\n67, 72-78; AE A-B) \nApplicant made a payment of an unspecified amount in October 2023 to resolve \nthe credit card debt. He made a $25 payment in March 2023 and three payments totaling \n$188 in August 2023 to resolve the city debt. The most recent credit bureau report from \nNovember 2023 does not reflect any debts in delinquent status, including his student \nloans. (Tr. 51-53, 60-61; GE 5; AE B) \nApplicant earned approximately $30,000 annually from 2016 to 2019; \napproximately $35,000 annually from 2019 until September 2022; and between $40,000 \nand $45,000 annually since then. He intends to seek part-time employment to supplement \nhis income. He and his sister split their monthly household expenses. He estimated that \nhis monthly net remainder, after expenses, was about $150 to $200. He has not received \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 30-31, 33-36, 53-58, 60, 64) \nApplicant provided letters of support from individuals who attested to his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Among these individuals were his employer\u2019s regional site \nmanager, as well as the physical security operations manager, both of whom describe \nApplicant as one of their best officers. (Tr. 64-65; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds... \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. His pre-SOR efforts to resolve his student loans were thwarted by his lack \nof available income. Since receiving the SOR, he resolved his two smaller SOR debts \nand has made meaningful progress in resolving his student loans, which are no longer in \ndelinquent status. His finances are under control and no longer cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n5 \n\n________________________ \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug and personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 10, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Service (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing reasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse and \npersonal conduct guidelines the DSCA CAS could not make the preliminary affirmative \ndetermination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral \nto an administrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked.

(Item 4) In an updated April 2022 PSI, he claimed an understanding at \nthe time that he thought he only has a temporary clearance and could not recall whether \nhe was granted a full clearance before his last use of marijuana during the Thanksgiving \nholidays. (Item 4) \nDISS CATS records document that Applicant was granted a full security \nclearance on July 31, 2021. DISS CATS records further document that he signed a non-\ndisclosure agreement (NDA) on August 9, 2021. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \nafter being granted access to classified information in July 2021, signing an NDA in \n2021, and completing an e-QIP in 2023, not only conflicts with his own claims of \nunknowing use of marijuana while having access to classified information, but contrasts \nand contradicts with  his commitments to avoidance of all uses of illegal drugs while \nholding a security clearance.  \nSummarized, Applicant\u2019s claims of isolated use of marijuana in November 2021 \nwithout any awareness of his violating his abstinence commitments cannot be \nreconciled with his received notices and acknowledged understandings of illegal drug \navoidance requirements for anyone with granted access to classified information. \nCommitments made to avoid illegal drugs while holding a security clearance cannot be \ndiscounted or relaxed absent exigent circumstances, which are not present in \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n  Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThe AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                                           \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n                                              \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \n \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

Considered together, \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs raises security concerns over whether his \nactions reflect an historical pattern of marijuana use incompatible with the good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified \ninformation. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to using marijuana raise security concerns over judgment \nand risks of recurrence. On the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while \ngranted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with \nmarijuana. For over two years, he has remained abstinent from illegal drugs (inclusive \nof marijuana) and exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or \npressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future. \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmarijuana) are encouraging. And, his efforts warrant partial application of two mitigating \nconditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \nthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to  .  .  .  \n, (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used  .  .  . \nStill, with the combination of a lengthy history of marijuana use (2010-2021) and \nhis continued use of the drug over a Thanksgiving holiday after being previously notified \nof his approved access to classified information, it is still too soon to absolve Applicant \nof risks of recurrence. Without more time and evidence from corroborating sources to \nestablish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence from the use of illegal drugs by \nApplicant, none of the mitigating conditions are fully available to him. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any judgment \nreservations the Government may have for the clearance holder employed by a defense \ncontractor, the Government has the right to expect the keeping of promises and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n      \n \n \n \n   \n                                \n \n \n \n                \n         \n  \n \n  \n \n                             \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ncommitments from the trust relationship it has with the clearance holder.

He lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in abstinence from active \nuse of illegal drugs to facilitate safe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, there is insufficient evidence of \nsustainable mitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments about \nApplicant\u2019s trusted ability to avoid illegal drugs in the foreseeable future. Taking into \naccount all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug activities over a \n10-plus- year periods, he does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the \nallegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and 2.a-2-b. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and\npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

At the time, he \ntravelled a significant distance from State B, where he lived and worked, to a U.S. \nterritory to repair communication equipment on a U.S. Naval vessel. He was in a high \nstress environment because there was a time deadline to complete his work on the \nNaval vessel before a typhoon came through the Territory. He and his supervisor had \nan argument over the timeliness of his efforts early one morning at about 2:00 or 3:00 \na.m. His supervisor thought Applicant should have completed his work earlier, but \nApplicant claimed he could not because of a customs issue. He ultimately completed his \nwork and heard nothing about fallout from the argument until a few months later when \nhe incorrectly filled out a timecard. As a result of the earlier argument, he was \ncounseled, told to be more careful with his language, and received a written reprimand. \nWhile it was not listed in the SOR, he also received written discipline for the timecard \nissue. He did not list either of the 2015 employment disciplinary actions in the 2021 SF \n86, but he listed both actions in the 2015 SF 86. (Tr. 23-26; Answer; GE 1, 2, 8, 9)  \nIn about October 2015, Applicant was charged by police with DUI. He claimed \nthat earlier that night, he had one whisky while playing pool with friends at a bar. \nHowever, during the 2020 PSI, he told a DOD investigator that he had about four beers \nover four or five hours.

He also provided this version of the \nreason for the accident to the DOD investigator during the 2020 PSI. He left his disabled \nvehicle, got a ride home from a friend and had a drink of whisky. He claimed that he \ndrank the whisky to calm his nerves. During the 2020 PSI, he told a DOD investigator \nthat he drank a beer at the friend\u2019s house who picked him up.

Police were on the scene \nand asked him to take a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer test. He refused. He \nclaimed that he refused these tests because they would be inaccurate because of the \nglass of whisky (or beer) he allegedly drank at home after the accident. He was arrested \nand taken to jail. He hired a lawyer and entered into a plea agreement reducing his \ncharge from DUI to reckless driving. The court required him to pay fines and costs \ntotaling about $1,095. It also required him to attend three hours of family counseling, 50 \nhours of community service, take a two-day aggressive driving course, and it \nsuspended his driver\u2019s license for three months.

During the 2020 PSI, he did not disclose his 2015 DUI arrest until he was confronted \nabout it by a DOD investigator. He told the DOD investigator that he did not disclose this \nDUI on the 2020 SF 86 or admit it until confronted because he was worried that it would \nnegatively impact his ability to obtain a security clearance. He claimed that he informed \nhis facility security officer (FSO) directly after his arrest. (Tr. 29, 38, 51, 53-; Answer; GE \n1-6; AE A) \nIn May 2020, Applicant\u2019s employer, a government contractor (Contractor A), \nterminated Applicant\u2019s employment. His supervisor, with whom he had been having \nongoing disagreements, accused Applicant of being at work while intoxicated. Applicant \ndenied that he was intoxicated at work. He claimed that he had two drinks the night \nbefore work, but he did not become intoxicated, and he stopped drinking at about 9:00 \np.m. the night before. However, minutes before he testified that he had two drinks, he \ntestified that he did not consume any alcohol. He claimed that his supervisor held a \ngrudge against him because he decided to stay with the subcontractor for whom he \nworked instead of accepting an offer with the general contractor for whom the \nsupervisor worked. He also claimed that he and his supervisor had the altercation \nbecause Applicant was not appropriately dressed. Initially, Applicant was terminated for \nbeing intoxicated at work. He received a termination letter to that effect. After he \ncontested the reason for his termination, Contractor A sent him a letter (Termination \nLetter) containing the subject matter line, \u201c[t]ermination of [e]mployment,\u201d informing him \nthat his services were no longer required.

(Tr. 29-34, 38, 40-43, 60-63; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4-6, 8) \nIn the 2020 SF 86, Applicant wrote that he left his employment with Contractor A \nbecause of stress, health problems, the death of his grandfather, and his father\u2019s health \nproblems. He also claimed he left because Contractor A was not allowing him to \npractice safe COVID-19 practices while he was living with his parents, who were \nparticularly vulnerable to it. He claimed he left by mutual agreement with the contractor \nfor unsatisfactory performance. He did not disclose that the contractor terminated his \nemployment and made no mention that he had been accused of being intoxicated at \nwork. During the 2020 PSI, he twice told the DOD investigator that the information he \nlisted in the 2020 SF 86 about the end of his employment with Contractor A was \naccurate. The second time the DOD investigator asked him, he expounded a little more \nand said that he did not like working for the overarching general contractor. (Tr. 38, 42-\n45; Answer; GE 2, 4, 5, 6, 8)  \nWhen the DOD investigator asked him a third time, Applicant admitted that \nContractor A had terminated him, and he had been accused of being intoxicated at \nwork. He also disclosed that his supervisor with Contractor A had accused him of being \nintoxicated at work on several occasions. Applicant told the investigator that he was \nnever intoxicated at work, but that he hobbled around because of an injury he suffered \nin a car accident. He also claimed that he was on an allergy medication that caused his \npupils to dilate. He initially claimed that what he wrote in the 2020 SF 86 about his \nreason for leaving Contractor A was his \u201cinterpretation\u201d of what information the 2020 SF \n86 required. He eventually admitted that he intentionally omitted the termination from \nContractor A and the reasons surrounding it because he feared for his security \nclearance and his employment chances. He acknowledged that this intentional omission \nshowed poor judgment. He testified that he did not try to mislead the DOD investigator, \nand because of stress and \u201cchaos,\u201d he thought all three explanations were true. He \nfurther testified that he thought the question about why he would lie on a security \nclearance application was a hypothetical that requested why a person who lied on a \nsecurity clearance application might do so. He did not make this point when he adopted \nhis 2020 PSI. Despite instructions in bold font informing Applicant that he could make \ncorrections to the summaries of his PSIs, he claimed he did not know he could do so. \nHe also testified that he was tired and worn down from travel, wanted the 2020 PSI to \nbe over, and just agreed with what the investigator said. (Tr. 38, 42-47, 53-55; Answer; \nGE 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) \nIn the 2021 SF 86, Applicant wrote that he left employment with Contractor A by \nmutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. He elaborated that he \nhad personal issues with the management team and that he was let go by the project \nmanager because he left the site during the COVID pandemic. He also claimed that his \nperformance was unsatisfactory because he was tired and because of mismanagement \nby the general contractor.

(Tr. 38, 47-48; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, \n8) \nOn August 30, 2022, at DOD\u2019s request, Applicant underwent a virtual \nassessment by a licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified neuropsychologist \n(Psychologist) utilizing the Zoom application. The psychologist issued a report based \nupon that assessment dated September 12, 2022. As part of the assessment, the \nPsychologist interviewed him and had him complete a standardized psychology \ninventory called the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). In her report, the \nPsychologist noted that Applicant was not forthcoming about the circumstances \nsurrounding his employment with Contractor A and his termination. Applicant also made \nno reference to the fact that he had been accused of being intoxicated at work. She \nfound Applicant to be evasive and not fully forthcoming with regards to his legal history. \nShe wrote that she is not confident that the information Applicant provided during the \ninterview was accurate. She noted that his PAI score with respect to alcohol related \ndifficulties was incongruent with what an honest responder might score given his history \nof alcohol-related incidents at work and in his social life. She wrote that he \u201cappears to \nlack insight into his past difficulties in the work place [sic], as well as in legal realms, due \nto alcohol use.\u201d (Tr. 34-35, 59; Answer; GE 6) \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related legal issues, the accusation against him \nthat he was intoxicated at work, his lack of candor about his alcohol related difficulties, \nand his continued consumption of alcohol, the Psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol \nuse disorder, mild, at a minimum. Given these issues, his lack of candor, and the \ninconsistencies between the records she reviewed and what he relayed during their \ninterview, she had significant concerns regarding his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. She reported that his prognosis is poor. Applicant testified that the \ninterview lasted 30 to 45 minutes, that the atmosphere was adversarial, and he was \nuncomfortable with the whole process. He claimed that the Psychologist lacked \nobjectivity, and he thought that she had already formed an opinion about him before the \ninterview. He has not had another assessment but testified that he would do so if \nrequired. (Tr. 34-35, 59-60; Answer; GE 6) \nApplicant testified that he modified his drinking after his 2015 DUI arrest. He \nclaimed that he did not drink at all for a couple of years. However, he also testified that \nhe reduced his alcohol consumption to a \u201cnegligible amount\u201d during this time. He started \nto drink again (or more) in 2018, but only an occasional beer after mowing the lawn. He \nclaimed he has not driven after consuming alcohol since 2015. He performs well at his \ncurrent job and provided several character-reference letters from friends and \ncolleagues. In those letters, his friends and colleagues note that he is honest, forthright, \nhardworking, loyal, dedicated, and he loves his country.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(b) alcohol related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was charged with DUI and convicted of that offense in 2003 after \nconsuming alcohol while underage and then driving. In 2015, he was arrested for DUI \nafter drinking and driving, getting into a single-car accident, and then refusing field \nsobriety and breathalyzer tests. While the accident may have been caused by \nsomething other than his alcohol consumption, he told a DOD investigator that he had \nfour beers that night prior to driving. This is sufficient evidence for me to find that the \nGovernment has met its burden of providing substantial evidence that Applicant was \ndriving his vehicle while impaired by alcohol. His refusal to submit to field sobriety and \nbreathalyzer tests provides additional context to inform this finding. Finally, a licensed \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclinical psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, mild. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), \nand 22(d) are established. \nAG \u00b6 22(b) is not established. I find there is insufficient evidence to establish that \nApplicant was intoxicated at work. While he was accused by a supervisor of being \nintoxicated while working, he denied it, and Contractor A did not ultimately terminate \nhim for being intoxicated. Therefore, I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c, as it \nindicates that he was terminated for being intoxicated at work. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \nIt has been about nine years since Applicant has had an established alcohol-\nrelated incident. Available evidence provides that he modified his alcohol consumption \nafter being arrested for DUI in 2015, and he continues to do so. I find that so much time \nhas passed that his alcohol-related incidents are unlikely to recur. I also find that he has \nacknowledged his pattern of maladaptive alcohol misuse and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant deliberately falsified the circumstances surrounding his termination \nfrom Contractor A on the 2020 SF 86. He claimed that he left by mutual agreement and \nprovided information implying that he left his employment there because he was \ndispleased with Contractor A. He did not divulge that Contractor A terminated him. \nApplicant did not deliberately fail to disclose his DUI arrests on the 2020 SF 86. \nWhile he did not divulge them on the 2020 SF 86, he divulged the 2003 arrest on the \n2011 SF 86 and the 2015 arrest on the 2015 SF 86. He also openly discussed the 2003 \narrest during the 2011 PSI and both DUI arrests during the 2016 PSI and 2020 PSI. I \nfind for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nApplicant deliberately falsified the circumstances surrounding his termination \nfrom Contractor A on the 2021 SF 86. Despite a DOD investigator making it clear to him \nin the 2020 PSI that he failed to properly report his termination in the 2020 SF 86, he \nrepeated his false claim in the 2021 SF 86 that he left Contractor A by mutual consent \nand again failed to disclose that he had been terminated. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts to a DOD investigator during the \n2021 PSI. During the interview, he told the investigator that he left employment with \nContractor A by mutual agreement. He did not tell the investigator that he had been \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterminated, despite having been previously confronted by another investigator with this \nfact. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct alleged under Guideline G that has been \ncross-referenced under Guideline E is explicitly covered under Guideline G. AG \u00b6 16(d) \nis not established by that cross-alleged conduct. Therefore, I find for Applicant with \nrespect to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant did not correct his falsification of the circumstances surrounding his \ntermination from Contractor A. Instead, during the 2020 PSI, the DOD investigator had \nto confront him before Applicant finally admitted he was terminated. He then repeated \nthe falsification in a subsequent SF 86 and during a subsequent PSI. AG \u00b6 17(a) does \nnot apply. \nDeliberately falsifying required information and lying to DOD investigators is not \nminor. Instead, these actions strike at the heart of the security clearance process, which \nrelies on candid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in this deceitful and \nmisleading activity multiple times and admitted that he did so to protect his security \nclearance and employment. Therefore, he has not shown that his behavior was \ninfrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant has not acknowledged his dishonest behavior. During the hearing, he \nclaimed that he told the truth on the security questionnaires and during the PSIs. \nHowever, he could not reasonably explain why he admitted that he lied to protect his \nsecurity clearance during his 2020 PSI. He has provided inconsistent reports of his \nconduct throughout the security clearance process. For the reasons I provided in my \nanalysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I do not find his dishonest behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) does not apply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 verbal reprimand for confrontational behavior may seem minor, \nhowever he had multiple instances of problem behavior with his employers. I do not find \nthat this type of behavior is infrequent or unlikely to recur. Moreover, he has not \nacknowledged his role in his problems with his past employers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) \ndo not apply to Applicant\u2019s verbal reprimand. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s good employment record. However, I find that the totality of the \nevidence, especially his dishonest behavior, leaves me with questions and doubts about \nhis eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I find the Guideline G security \nconcerns were either not established or mitigated but the Guideline E security concerns \nwere not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-2.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 3, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on March 1, 2023, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 7, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on November \n16, 2023, scheduling the matter for a video conference hearing on December 6, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. At the hearing, I admitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I \n1 \n\n \nkept the record open until December 20, 2023, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentation. He timely submitted documents, which I marked collectively as AE B and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 18, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. He is 45 years old. He has never \nmarried and he does not have children. (Tr. 7, 30, 32; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1996. He has worked as a logistics \ncoordinator for his employer, a defense contractor, since July 2008. He does not recall \nwhen he was granted a security clearance. (Tr. 7-9, 30-31; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had five delinquent consumer debts totaling $40,875 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) and a $96 delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The SOR allegations \nare established by his admissions in his Answer; his September 2022 interview with an \nauthorized DoD background investigator; and credit bureau reports (CBR) from June \n2022, January 2023, and November 2023. (GE 2-6) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts primarily to minimal income. He also \nincurred additional expenses when he moved in July 2023. He acknowledged that his \nfinancial irresponsibility also contributed to his delinquencies. (Tr. 37, 52, 55-59, 67-69; \nGE 2; AE) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $10,6843 charged-off auto loan. In October 2019, Applicant was in \na no-fault car accident that totaled his car. He believed the insurance company of the at-\nfault individual was responsible for paying the remaining balance on the loan, but it only \npaid half. In approximately February 2023, he contacted the creditor to try to settle this \ndebt. He intends to resolve it. (Tr. 32-35, 60-61; GE 2-4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a $2,256 charged-off credit card. Applicant obtained this card during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. He intends to contact the creditor to try to settle this debt. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Tr. 35-39, 61-62; GE 2, 4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are charged-off credit cards with the same creditor, in the \namounts of $900 and $629, respectively. He contacted the creditor and settled the debts \nfor a total of $900 and he paid $540 and $377, respectively, in September 2022. Both \n2023 CBRs reflect that these debts are settled and paid. (Tr. 39-40, 62; GE 2-4, 6; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is an auto loan past due in the amount of $7,806 on a $26,247 total \nbalance. This loan is for Applicant\u2019s current car. He stated that since approximately early \n2023, he makes his monthly car payment of $673 at the beginning of every month and \nthen pays an additional $350 in the middle of the month for the past due balance. He \nprovided documentation reflecting that he has had a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor since June 2022, scheduled to continue through November 2024, consisting of \nautomatic deductions from his bank account of $350 biweekly. He did not, however, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide documentation to corroborate his payments. (Tr. 40-44, 62-65, 67; GE 2-4, 6; AE \nB) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $96 medical debt in collection. Applicant was unaware of this debt. \nHe intends to look into it. (Tr. 44-46, 70-71; GE 3) \nApplicant earned approximately $30,000 annually when he first started working for \nhis employer. His income incrementally increased and he has been earning \napproximately $48,000 annually since around 2021. After paying his monthly expenses, \nto include $3,300 in rent, he does not have much of a monthly net remainder. He stated \nthat he utilizes a budget to track his income and expenses. He estimated a balance of \n$100 in his combined checking and savings accounts and $12,000 in his retirement \nsavings account. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He has not received credit \ncounseling. He anticipated receiving a pay raise and he applied for part-time jobs. He \nintends to resolve his debts so that he could purchase a home. (Tr. 31-32, 51-59, 65-69) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, \nso I find those debts in his favor. He did not provide documentation to corroborate any of \nhis claims of payment for SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he has yet to address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f. \nHe has not received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has \nhis finances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations charged under Guideline B concerning his family members in Bangladesh, and he denied all of the allegations cited under Guidelines F and E. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 40 years old. He was born in Bangladesh. In 2006 he obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in that country, and in June 2006, he married his wife. In 2007, he moved to the United States, and in 2013, his wife and their older son moved to the U.S. He has two sons, ages 9 and 14, and his youngest son has been diagnosed with autism. His youngest son requires a special diet and expensive medication that is not covered by insurance. In 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020, Applicant was unable to work and received unemployment until 2021. Since 2022 he has been employed by a government contractor as a testing engineer. His current salary is $97,000. His wife does not work.

During the hearing, I invited \nApplicant to provide missing bank statements from his AE F and to complete a Personal \nFinancial Statement (PFS).

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was born in Bangladesh. In 2006 he obtained his \nbachelor\u2019s degree from a university in that country, and in June 2006, he married his wife. \nIn 2007, he moved to the United States, and in 2013, his wife and their older son moved \nto the U.S. He has two sons, ages 9 and 14, and his youngest son has been diagnosed \nwith autism. His youngest son requires a special diet and expensive medication that is \nnot covered by insurance. In 2012, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. When \nthe COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020, Applicant was unable to work and \nreceived unemployment until 2021. Since 2022 he has been employed by a government \ncontractor as a testing engineer. His current salary is $97,000. His wife does not work. \nThis is Applicant\u2019s first application for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 39-48; GE 1; SOR \nresponse) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant began to experience financial difficulties after their second baby was \nborn in 2014. His wife was unemployed, and he relied on several credit cards to pay their \nmonthly household expenses. In 2016, their younger son was diagnosed with severe \nautism. At that time, they spent a significant amount of money for his treatment.

He \nprovided some bank statements that showed he made monthly payments of $907 in \nOctober and November 2019, March 2020, May through December 2020, and in June, \nJuly, October, and November 2022. It appears he completed the program in May 2023. \nThere is no information showing which delinquent creditors were included in this \nagreement, and which accounts were settled or satisfied while he was enrolled in the \nprogram. During the hearing, I offered Applicant the opportunity to provide more \ninformation on this matter while the record was held open. He did not submit additional \ndocumentation. (AE E, AE F; Tr. 50-55) \nThe SOR was issued in February 2023. Applicant provided documentation that in \nMarch 2023, he entered into a repayment agreement with another consumer debt \nresolution company (B). In this agreement he was to begin making monthly payments of \n$325 in March 2023, with his last payment scheduled for February 2026. There is no \nsupporting documentation to show what delinquent debts were included in the program \nor whether Applicant made any of these payments. (AE D) \nTwo months later, in May 2023, Applicant joined debt resolution company (C) to \nobtain debt settlements from his remaining delinquent creditors alleged in (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a \ndepartment store account in the amount of $8,203; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i), credit card \naccounts with the same creditor in the amounts of $3,799 and $825, respectively; and \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), for a bank credit card referred for collection in the amount of $3,442, for a \ncombined total of $16,269. He was to make monthly payments of $300 beginning in May \n2023 for an estimated 42 months. Based on the current credit report obtained in \nNovember 2023, it does not appear Applicant made the monthly payments per the terms \nof the agreement since several of the delinquent account balances remained unchanged \nafter the SOR was issued in February 2023. Only one debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was \nreduced by $59. He did not provide supporting documentation while the record was held \nopen to provide verification of monthly payments. These delinquent accounts remain \nunresolved. (AE B, GE 3, GE 4) \nThe November 2023 credit report showed that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.g, and 1.h (unpaid credit cards and another department store account with a combined \ntotal of $10,212), had been settled for less than the full balance. These debts are resolved. \nThe remaining delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, (a collection account \nand a retail merchant account totaling $6,000), did not appear on the current credit report. \nAlthough there is no documentation in the record to show that these debts were resolved, \nI have credited Applicant with the resolution of these debts based on his testimony and \nassurances that these debts were included in the first consumer debt resolution \ncompany\u2019s agreement he hired in 2019.

In response \nto Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record: Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts: In the \npast seven (7) years, [have you] defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned \nover to a collection agency; \u2026 been over 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously \nentered\u201d; Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d He deliberately falsified this information when he \nfailed to disclose his delinquent debts from the past seven years, as required. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.) In his SOR response and during the hearing, he stated that because he had \narranged to pay his delinquent debts through a consumer debt resolution company, he \nthought his denial on the SCA was appropriate. He said he did not fully understand the \nquestion and had no intention of omitting his delinquent financial obligations. (SOR \nresponse; Tr. 55-60) \nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant about his background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator in August 2022. Applicant had verified with the investigator \nthat all of the information he provided in his SCA was accurate. When the investigator \nconfronted him about a charged-off debt with a department store in the amount of $8,203, \nApplicant had disagreed with the information and stated that he was unaware of the \naccount. (Tr. 57-59) \nThe following relevant information was developed during the hearing: \nDepartment Counsel: \u2026at the time of the interview you knew you had this \n[department store] credit card that was delinquent; right? \nApplicant:  Yes. \nDepartment Counsel: So, why did you tell the investigator that you \ndisagreed and that you were not aware of the account? \nApplicant: Again, sir, I\u2019m so foolish that I write, not write this time true. I \nwas thinking that company take care of my credit cards. So, was telling me,\nlike, everything they will take care of. I don\u2019t have to worry about anything. \n \nDepartment Counsel: \u2026 So, one of the big things we care about in these \nsecurity clearance hearings is truthfulness. And it looks like that you \npurposely lied to the investigator. Did you lie to the investigator? \nApplicant: On that one I can say yes, I lied on that. Now I understand, sir. \nBut for this lying, I just begging you, ma\u2019am, like please pardon me about \nlike please pardon me about that. I agree with you, like, I was lying that time \nbecause of my misunderstanding, too. (Tr. 59-60) \nAdmin. Judge: All right.

And then when you met with the investigator during \nyour background interview, when she confronted you with all these \ndelinquent debts you lied to her about your debt situation; correct? \nApplicant: Yes. (Tr. 80-81) \nOn the basis of this testimony, I find that Applicant admitted that he deliberately \nfailed to disclose his debts on his SCA. Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also \nadmitted lying to the investigator during his background interview about his debts. \nForeign Influence \nSOR \u00b6 3.a stated that Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Bangladesh. \nApplicant testified that his father passed away in February 2023. This allegation is \nresolved in favor of Applicant. (Tr. 60-61; SOR response) \nApplicant\u2019s brother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.b) Applicant stated that his brother is 55 years old and is employed as a sales \nmanager in food supplies. He has never been affiliated with the Bangladesh military or \ngovernment. Applicant speaks with his brother every week through Facebook Messenger. \nHe last saw his brother in person in 2019 on a trip to Bangladesh. At one point Applicant \ngave his brother approximately $500 after he requested the funds to repair their father\u2019s \nhome. (Tr. 61-65, 72-73) \nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is a housewife. She is not affiliated with the Bangladesh \nmilitary or government. He rarely communicates with her and the last time he saw all of \nhis sisters in person was when he traveled to Bangladesh in 2019. His middle sister and \nyounger sister are employed as teachers for primary schools. Teaching positions are \naffiliated with the Bangladesh government because the schools are managed by the \ngovernment. The last time he communicated with these sisters was approximately six \nmonths ago. His siblings have never been threatened by any Bangladesh authorities and \nthey live in safe locations. (Tr. 65-70) \nThe SOR alleges that his mother-in-law is a citizen of Bangladesh. (SOR \u00b6 3.c) \nApplicant stated that his mother-in-law is a green card holder and lives with his family in \nthe U.S. about six months out of the year. She returns to Bangladesh to reside for the \nremaining six months.

(Tr. 73-75) \nAdministrative Notice \nBangladesh obtained its independence from Pakistan in 1971 and pursuant to its \nconstitution of 1972, it became a parliamentary democracy. Relations with Bangladesh \nand the United States are excellent, and Bangladesh has become a valuable United \nStates ally in the Global War on Terrorism. However, its human rights record has \nworsened over the years. Incidents causing injury and death derived from hate-based \ncommunal protests and political differences occurred, with some violent extremist group \ninvolvement. Some of the security forces have been accused of conducting extra-judicial \nkillings, arbitrary arrest and detention, and other human rights violations. The United \nStates Department of State advises United States citizens to exercise caution in \nBangladesh due to crime, terrorism, and kidnappings. (AN 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged and the Government established that Applicant had nine \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $34,200. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolve or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to a period of unemployment \nduring the pandemic and the expenses associated with the treatment and medication for \nhis son\u2019s medical condition. Notwithstanding these events that impacted his finances, \nApplicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nadmitted that he hired a consumer debt resolution company in 2019 to assist him with his \ndelinquent creditors, which demonstrates responsible behavior, but he did not include all \nof his delinquent accounts with this company. He successfully completed the terms of the \nagreement with this debt resolution company. \nAfter receipt of the SOR, Applicant retained first one (B), and then another \nconsumer debt resolution company (C) to assist him with four SOR accounts totaling over \n$16,200. Beginning in May 2023, he was to make monthly payments of $300 for an \nestimated 42 months. The November 2023 credit report does not show that Applicant \nabided by the terms of his repayment agreement since three of the four SOR account \nbalances remained unchanged, and one creditor account had been reduced by $59. He \ndid not provide supporting documentation while the record was held open to provide \nverification of systematic monthly payments from May 2023 through November 2023. \nApplicant did not demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his financial \ndelinquencies. He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \u2026 \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material information \non his SCA he completed in June 2022. I find that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nhis delinquent debts on his SCA. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or\nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \nApplicant did not disclose on the June 2022 SCA that he had several delinquent \naccounts within the past seven years. He initially claimed that since he had joined a \nconsumer debt resolution company in 2019, he did not believe he had to disclose his \nadverse financial information. When he was interviewed by an investigator shortly \nthereafter, she asked Applicant about a significant department store delinquent account, \nbut he denied being aware of the account and disputed the information. He disagreed \nwith all of delinquent accounts that were listed on his credit report. During the hearing, \nApplicant eventually admitted that he deliberately omitted listing his adverse financial \naccounts on the June 2022 SCA and that he lied during his background investigation too \nafter being confronted by the investigator. Applicant\u2019s failure to admit information honestly \nand candidly about his finances to the investigator will not be considered for \ndisqualification purposes. It will be considered in the mitigation and whole-person \nanalysis. \nIn light of the deliberate omission on his SCA and Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \nstatements during the security clearance investigation and hearing, I find that Applicant\nis not a credible witness. Overall, Applicant\u2019s failure to be honest and candid casts doubt\non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns\nare not mitigated. \n \n \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) (see previous section for format-consistency): contact, regardless of \nmethod, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n (b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \n[sensitive] information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). To establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Bangladesh. Given \nthe presence and activities of several terrorist organizations hostile to the interests of the \nUnited States in Bangladesh, the Government has established the requisite \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d and potential conflict of interest regarding Applicant\u2019s contacts with his brother, three \nsisters, and mother-in-law in Bangladesh. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 8 includes the following mitigating conditions under this guideline as \npotentially relevant: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe U.S. government has assessed that terrorist organizations pose an ongoing \nthreat to U.S. interests and foreigners in Bangladesh. Applicant\u2019s two sisters are \nemployed as teachers in primary education, which is managed by the government of \nBangladesh. Applicant actively maintains close relationships with his brother and mother-\nin-law, and to a lesser extent, his three sisters in Bangladesh. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not \napply. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s family members in Bangladesh, he has forged deep \nrelationships with U.S. citizens and strongly believes that he and his family are better \nsituated in the U.S., such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest, should any conflict arise. He came to the U.S. 16 years ago and \nhe hopes to purchase a home soon. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s deep relationships \nforged in this country mitigate the foreign influence security concern triggered by his \ncontacts in Bangladesh. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, E and B \nand the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s longstanding residency in the U.S., and the close relationships his \nfamily members have made here are such that any conflict of interest can be expected to \nbe resolved in favor of the U.S. interest. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns. However, his outstanding delinquent accounts totaling over \n$16,200 and the lack of supporting documentation of a good-faith repayment plan \nconcerning these debts, combined with his admitted falsification, reflect poor judgment \nand casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in the original SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) and provided a narrative explanation. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He graduated high school in 2008. He served in the Army from 2009 to 2011 and was discharged honorably. He and his wife married in 2012. They have one son, age eight. His son is developmentally disabled. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He worked in county government in State 1 from 2013-2014 and worked as a software engineer 2014-2015. He worked as a consultant in State 1 2015 to 2020. He left the job by mutual agreement after he was unable to work effectively from home during the COVID pandemic. This was due, at least in part, to fact that he found it difficult to work from home while balancing childcare responsibilities for his child with special needs. Applicant moved to State 2, where he had family support, in September 2020. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor and clearance sponsor, since October 2020, as a software engineering manager.

On January 29, 2024, following \nconsultation with the parties, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for March 8, \n2024. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through P. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I held the post-hearing \nrecord open, initially until March 25, 2024, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional information. He timely submitted numerous documents, which are marked as \nAE Q through AE BB. On March 28, 2024, he submitted one additional document, which \nis marked as AE CC. All of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 18, 2024. The record \nclosed on April 2, 2024. \nAmendment to the SOR \nAt the end of the hearing, based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, Department Counsel \nmoved to amend the SOR to add the following allegation:  \n1.j:  \nYou failed to file Federal tax returns for tax years 2021-2022.  \nThe amendment was adopted without objection. As noted above, Applicant was \ngiven time after the hearing to provide additional documentation on the new allegation. \n(Tr. 119-124) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the original SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) and provided a \nnarrative explanation. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He graduated high school in 2008. He served in the Army \nfrom 2009 to 2011 and was discharged honorably. He and his wife married in 2012. They \nhave one son, age eight. His son is developmentally disabled. Applicant earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He worked in county government in State 1 from 2013-2014 \nand worked as a software engineer 2014-2015. He worked as a consultant in State 1 \n2015 to 2020. He left the job by mutual agreement after he was unable to work effectively \nfrom home during the COVID pandemic. This was due, at least in part, to fact that he \nfound it difficult to work from home while balancing childcare responsibilities for his child \nwith special needs. Applicant moved to State 2, where he had family support, in \nSeptember 2020. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor and \nclearance sponsor, since October 2020, as a software engineering manager.

They are generally debts to consumer \ncreditors and public utilities. They are largely established through Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports from April 2022 and November 2022. (GE 2, GE 3) Applicant also disclosed \nseveral of his debts on his SCA and discussed them in his background interview. (GE 1, \nGE 2) The Government also provided a recent credit report, from March 2024. (GE 8) \nIn his answer to the SOR, and at the start of his testimony, Applicant noted that he \nhad made several poor financial decisions, due to what he called a \u201ccomplicated and \nfrustrating marriage.\u201d He said he has \u201ca hard time saying \u2018no\u2019\u201d to his wife, while \nacknowledging that this does not excuse him from fulfilling his obligations. He noted that \nmost of his debts are not recent, and that he and his wife have not incurred many new \ndebts beyond a leased vehicle. He noted that other debts not alleged in the SOR have \nbeen recently resolved, that he has sought financial counseling, and that he intends to \ncontinue to work to resolve his debts. (Answer; Tr. 29-27) \nIn his prior job, Applicant earned about $100,000 annually. He began his current \njob, in October 2020, at about $120,000 annually, and he now earns $143,000 annually. \nHowever, there is a higher cost of living in State 2. This includes a higher monthly \nmortgage and a higher interest rate. He saw moving as a fresh start, but he and his wife \nalso began falling behind on their debts soon after, in 2021. They considered bankruptcy \nafter seeking legal advice. He was advised to stop paying on his debts, but he also never \nfinalized a bankruptcy filing. He said he is now in worse financial shape than before. His \nson also faced expensive surgery, which was successful. Applicant and his family are on \nhis company\u2019s insurance plan but still faced medical expenses. He said he is in a difficult \nfinancial situation but is making progress. He intends to continue addressing his debts as \nbest he can. Applicant\u2019s wife recently began working part time but does not make much \nmoney. They home-school their son, so his wife\u2019s work means Applicant is more involved \nin dealing with school personnel. (Tr. 33-40, 61-62, 70-72, 117) \nApplicant has not participated in formal credit counseling recently. He spoke to a \nfinancial advisor when he lived in State 1. He also has a mentor who he met through his \nchurch in State 1, someone who he turns to for personal, marital, and financial advice. \nThe mentor runs his own company and is experienced in financial matters. The mentor \nadvised him to \u201cstop using credit\u201d and to cut down on expenses. Applicant acknowledged \nthat, with a special needs child, returning to financial stability is a long path. He tracks his \nmonthly expenses on a spreadsheet. Applicant also has seen a professional mental \nhealth counselor. He recently traded in his vehicle for a newer model He and his wife \nhave car payments of a combined $1,700 a month, due to high interest rates. Applicant \nsaid he received about $600 in disability benefits from the VA. He and his wife are living \npaycheck to paycheck, but her new job has allowed them to build a safety net. (Tr. 53-\n59, 64-65, 68-70, 89-90, 94-96, 104, 111-115, 130-131)  \nIn AE B, Applicant updated his financial situation and addressed the state of each \nSOR debt in a chart. He noted that when he answered the SOR, only one alleged debt \nwas under a payment arrangement. Since then, two small debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i) had \nbeen paid, and all but three of the others (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g) were under payment \narrangements, as were some debts that were not alleged.

While they \nare listed as current on a recent credit report, he is not making current, regular payments \non his student loans; however, he has contacted the creditor to arrange payments. (Tr. \n105-111) \nWhen questioned, Applicant testified that when he attempted to file his federal tax \nreturns for tax year (TY) 2022, he learned that his tax returns for TY 2021 had not been \nfiled with the IRS, although they were on record with the nationally known tax filing \nsoftware program (TFSP) he has used for years. He believes he would have been owed \na small refund for TY 2021 and that he owed about $150 for TY 2022. He also said he \nfiled an extension for TY 2022, but then forgot to follow up and file the TY 2022 return as \nwell, though he did pay the TFSP company to do so. His TY 2023 returns were due in \nmid-April 2024, about five weeks after the hearing date. State 2, where Applicant lives, \ndoes not have a state income tax filing requirement. (Tr. 98-103) (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided documentation that largely corroborates his \nassertions. He provided his federal returns for TY 2021 ($240 refund) and TY 2022 (owes \n$155), with extensive supporting federal forms for both years.

(AE \nO, AE P) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016), the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that failure to file tax returns is a security concern: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant incurred over $60,000 in delinquent debts in recent years. He also failed \nto timely file federal income tax returns for TY 2021 and TY 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant incurred some delinquent debts when he and his family were living in \nState 1. They moved to State 2 in fall of 2020. He took a job with a higher salary, but also \ndiscovered that State 2 had a higher cost of living. He and his wife began seriously falling \nbehind on their debts in early 2021. Applicant acknowledged that many of his debts were \ndue to poor financial choices. They have a child with special needs whom they are home \nschooling. This impacts the ability of Applicant and his wife to both pursue full-time \nemployment. Their son also had expensive surgery recently. \nApplicant began paying on some of his debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d) in about \nNovember 2022. Similarly, he is resolving other unalleged debts under payment plans \nwith an established track record. Some small, old utility debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i) are \npaid and resolved, as is another larger unalleged debt that Applicant resolved through \nmoney from his 401(k). Applicant\u2019s efforts to address other debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f) began \nonly shortly before the hearing. Some debts have yet to be addressed (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, \nand 1.g) and there are some newer, smaller delinquencies on GE 8, a recent credit report. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s 2021 and 2022 federal tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.j), the \ndocumentation Applicant provided corroborated much of what he said about them. \nHowever, he did not establish that either return had been filed with the IRS by the close \nof the record. While his tax filing issues are limited to these two years, they are also \nunresolved. This undercuts the evidence that Applicant has been making some headway \ntowards addressing his quite significant financial delinquencies through good-faith, \nresponsible action. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has numerous unresolved financial \ndelinquencies and two years of federal income tax returns that he has not shown to have \nbeen filed. His financial issues are ongoing and not isolated and they continue to cast \ndoubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nThe record supporting full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) is mixed. As \nApplicant acknowledged, his debts, many of which are consumer credit accounts, were \nlargely incurred due to poor financial decisions. He earns a good income, though he and \nhis wife faced a higher cost of living when they moved to State 2 in late 2020. Applicant\u2019s \nability to better address his debts is negatively impacted by the fact that he and his wife \nhave a child with special needs, which is a circumstance beyond their control that effects \ntheir ability to both work outside the home full time and earn more income. \nApplicant began addressing his debts in late 2022, which is before the SOR was \nissued. He has been on a payment plan for some of his debts (some alleged, some not) \nsince then. This is evidence of good faith. Action on other debts is more recent and was \ntaken on the eve of the hearing, which undercuts a finding that they are taken wholly in \ngood faith. Some debts are not yet addressed (again, some alleged, some not). Applicant \nhas acknowledged that he has a long way to go to tackle his debt load and to achieve \nreal financial stability. He is not required to address all his debts at once, or to address \nthem in a particular way. But he must show that he has addressed his debts in a good-\nfaith, responsible manner under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) have some \napplication, but do not fully apply to mitigate his debts, given what remains. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply to Applicant\u2019s tax returns, which, though limited \nto two tax years, are also recent and unresolved. He has not established that he has \nmade arrangements with the IRS to file them. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nApplicant also is given some credit under AG \u00b6 20(c). He has engaged a financial \nmentor, though not an established credit counseling service, to assist him on the path to \nfinancial stability. However, he is still in a precarious position, and given the amount of \nhis remaining debt load, he did not provide enough evidence that his financial issues are \nbeing resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions based on all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered the whole person evidence provided by his references, as well as \nApplicant\u2019s military service. Applicant has numerous past due debts that remain \nunresolved. He did not provide enough evidence that the debts have been or are being \nresolved or that his tax issues are sufficiently in the past to mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. He needs to establish a consistent track record of debt resolution, financial \nstability, and compliance with tax filing requirements to fully mitigate financial security \nconcerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. This is not to say that \nApplicant might be a suitable candidate for eligibility for access to classified information \nin the future, if his financial stability improves. But at this time, I conclude Applicant did \nnot meet his burden to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial security concerns \nabout his delinquent debts and his unfiled tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

During his active service, he was deployed to a combat zone from May 2004 to \nFebruary 2005 and from August 2006 to October 2007. (AX H) He was awarded the Joint \nService Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, \nCombat Action Badge, Parachutist Badge, and various service medals. (GX 4 at 7, 14; \nAX H) While serving as a second lieutenant in September 2004, his company commander \nrecommended that he receive the Bronze Star Medal, but his award was downgraded to \nan Army Commendation Medal. (AX L) \nIn October 2007, Applicant was medically evacuated from his overseas \nassignment to the United States. (AX R) He was placed on the temporary disability retired \nlist in July 2011, and retired because of permanent physical disability in April 2014.

He received a security clearance in October 2004. \nApplicant married in December 2003, divorced in January 2008, and married in \nMay 2010. He has two children from his second marriage, ages 14 and 11. \nThe charges alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a were the result of incident involving his then \ngirlfriend and another woman. He was accused of grabbing and squeezing the two \nwomen by the neck for approximately 30 seconds, pushing one of the women onto a bed \nand squeezing her neck until she could not breathe, and slamming one of the women into \na wall while choking her. The arrest is reflected in GX 8. Applicant admitted the arrest in \nhis answer to the SOR. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he stated that, while he was separated from \nhis spouse in 2017, he began a relationship with Woman A. On the night of May 5 and \nthe morning of May 6, 2017, Applicant, Woman A, and Woman A\u2019s friend (Woman B) \nreturned to a hotel room he had rented after a night of bar hopping and drinking. Applicant \ntestified that he stopped drinking after they left the second bar, but the two women \ncontinued drinking at a third bar. (Tr. 34) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that both women were heavily intoxicated, and \nWoman B was invited to the room because she was too intoxicated to take a taxi or \nsubway train home. There was only one bed in the room. Woman A put Woman B into \nthe bed and placed a trash can next to the bed in case Woman B vomited. Woman A and \nApplicant got into the bed, with Applicant between the two women. (Tr. 34-36) According \nto Applicant, Woman A wanted to have intercourse, but he declined, because Woman B \nwas also in the bed and because Woman A was drunk. (Tr. 102) Woman A argued and \nasked Applicant if he wanted to have intercourse with Woman B. Woman A started calling \nhim names and hitting him. Woman B woke up and the two women started fighting. \nApplicant testified that he separated the two women with his hands on their necks. He \ntold both women to leave the room. When they refused, he forcibly ejected them. A hotel \nsecurity officer came to the room and asked if there was a problem, and Applicant told \nthe security officer that he had ejected the two women from his room. About an hour later, \nseveral police officers came to the room and arrested Applicant and took him to the police \nstation. He was detained for a few hours and then released. (Tr. 102-08) \nApplicant admitted that he put hands on the necks of both women to keep them \napart, but he denied choking them. (Tr. 105) He denied shoving one woman against a \nwall, but he admitted shoving her out of the room. He attended seven court hearings, \nrepresented by his brother, who is a lawyer. In February 2018, the charges were \ndismissed due to lack of evidence, failure of the arresting officer to appear in court, failure \nof Woman A to appear in court, and violation of his right to a speedy trial.

During an interview preceding a polygraph \nexamination on November 13, 2020, Applicant disclosed that he went to a massage parlor \nin 2018, while traveling away from home. He suffers from back pain and regularly receives \nmassages to alleviate his back pain. He was unable to find a massage parlor from his \ncustomary franchise at home, and so he went to an alternate parlor. He paid $20 for a \nmassage, and the masseuse ended the session by masturbating him. He was surprised \nbut made no attempt to stop it. He did not pay extra for the \u201chappy ending.\u201d (GX 5 at 2) \nThere is no evidence in the record reflecting that his conducted violated local law. \nHowever, Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that his conduct was illegal. \nIn 2020, Applicant traveled to the same city and chose to get a massage in a similar \narea of the city.

(Tr. 88) \nDuring a polygraph examination in February 2017, Applicant disclosed that he had \nengaged in prostitution on three occasions in 2009, 2011, and 2016. He did not disclose \nthat he engaged in prostitution three additional times between 2003 and 2004 and again \nin 2011. He underwent another polygraph examination in November 2020, in connection \nwith his application to another government agency for eligibility to have access to \nsensitive compartmented information.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant admitted that he was reprimanded by his commander for having an \nextramarital affair and consorting with prostitutes. There is no evidence in the record \nreflecting that prostitution was illegal in the two foreign countries where Applicant \nengaged in prostitution. Similarly, there is no evidence in the record that the \u201chappy \nending\u201d was illegal in the state where it occurred. Even though Department Counsel \nsubmitted no evidence of any criminal laws that were violated by his conduct, Applicant \nadmitted that he was guilty of criminal conduct. \nApplicant was arrested on May 6, 2017, and charged with (1) strangulation in the \nsecond degree, a felony; (2) criminal obstruction of breathing, a misdemeanor; and (3) \nassault in the third degree with intent to cause physical injury, a misdemeanor. Although \nApplicant denied committing the offenses, he admitted that he was arrested. \nApplicant admitted having an extramarital affair and consorting with prostitutes \nwhile assigned overseas and that his conduct was illegal. He also admitted trying to quell \na fight between two women, but denied the criminal acts that were alleged. He admitted \nreceiving a \u201chappy ending\u201d after receiving a massage in 2018. His admissions are \nsufficient to establish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and the following disqualifying \ncondition: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(c) are established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The \nincident in the hotel brawl occurred more than seven years ago. It was a bizarre situation \nthat is not likely to recur. Applicant was accused of this misconduct by two heavily \nintoxicated women. Woman A has recanted her accusation. The case lingered through \nseven hearings and finally was dismissed on multiple grounds, including lack of evidence. \n(GX 6 at 4) \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant has not repeated the criminal activity \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, but his lack of candor during the adjudication of his application \nfor a security clearance (discussed below under Guideline E) undermines a finding of \nrehabilitation. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c as sexual behavior \nunder this guideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment\nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise\nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior\nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or\nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this\nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the\nindividual. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \nApplicant admitted that his consorting with prostitutes and receiving a sexual \nmassage violated criminal statutes. His admissions are sufficient to establish behavior \nthat made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress and reflect a lack of discretion \nand good judgment. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) are established. \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s most recent sexual incident alleged in the \nSOR occurred in 2018, about six years ago, and it has not recurred. He has been \nevaluated by a clinical psychologist with experience in treating sexual addiction or \ncompulsivity, and he received a favorable prognosis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c as personal \nconduct under this guideline. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.f allege that Applicant falsified material facts \nduring a polygraph examination in February 2017, in an SCA submitted in October 2018, \nduring a security interview in February 2019, in a SCA submitted in April 2020, and during \na polygraph interview in November 2020, by failing to disclose the \u201cfull extent\u201d of the \ncriminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . :engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nSOR \u00b6 3.a, cross-alleging the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c, is \nestablished. The bizarre circumstances, in which Applicant, separated from his wife but \nnot divorced, spent a night bar hopping and, while somewhat intoxicated, shared a bed \nwith two heavily intoxicated women and then attempted to stop a fight between the two \nwomen instead of leaving the room or summoning law enforcement personnel, raises \nserious questions about his judgment which are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 16(c) and \n16(e). His responses at the hearing focused on refuting his guilt of the criminal charges \nand did not adequately address his bad judgment in putting himself in a bizarre, \nuncontrollable, and embarrassing situation. His involvement with prostitutes on multiple \noccasions and receiving a sexual massage in 2018 are also sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 \n16(c) and 16(e). \nSOR \u00b6 3.b, alleging falsification during a polygraph examination in February 2017 \nis established.

The \npurpose of the SCA is to discover potential disqualifying conduct that may require further \ninvestigation. An Applicant is required to disclose sufficient information to enable further \ninvestigation. He or she is not required recite all the details of an incident, especially if the \ndetails are disputed. Applicant disclosed the date and place of the incident, recited the \ngeneral circumstances leading up to his arrest, and the disposition of the charges, which \nwas sufficient information to enable security investigators to further investigate the \nincident. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d, alleging that Applicant did not disclose the \u201cfull extent\u201d of his criminal \nconduct during a security interview in February 2019, is not established. The SOR does \nnot allege what material facts were not disclosed. The investigator\u2019s summary does not \nreflect what questions he asked. Applicant told the investigator that he did not recall the \nspecific charges against him. This statement is consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony at \nthe hearing that the judge \u201cread off a whole bunch of charges and stuff.\u201d The evidence \ndoes not establish any intentional and material omissions. \nSOR \u00b6 3.f, alleging that Applicant did not disclose the full extent of his criminal \nconduct during a polygraph interview in November 2020 is not established. The \ninformation in the examiner\u2019s report is generally consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony at \nthe hearing. Applicant has consistently denied that he assaulted the women or used \nexcessive force to subdue them. His refusal to admit the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a does not amount to falsifying material facts during the interview. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) is established for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.b. It is not established for \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6 3.c-3.f. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and17(c) are not established for Applicant\u2019s falsification during a \npolygraph examination in February 2017.

Aug. 8, \n2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, D, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, including his service in a combat zone, and his service-related \ndisabilities. I have considered the testimonials to his strong moral character, integrity, \ngood judgment, and reliability. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines J, D, and E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his sexual \nbehavior, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct \nand personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c (2018 incident): \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c (2020 incident): \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a, cross-alleging \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c-3.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He \npreviously held a security clearance while serving in the Air Force from 2005 until 2013 \nand was discharged honorably. He married in 2011 and divorced in 2019 and has one \nchild, age 14. (GE 1; Tr. at 19-20.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied all the Guideline E allegations with \nthe exception of SOR \u00b6 1.b and denied SOR \u00b6 2.a under Guideline H, which cross-alleged \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 44.) \nThe allegations arose from a February 2021 incident while Applicant was \nemployed overseas by Company 1A. SOR 1.a, states: \nIn February 2021, while you were employed by [Company 1A] at [an] Air \nBase in [Country Y], a package containing marijuana was mailed to you and \nintercepted by customs officials. You subsequently told the Air Force Office \nof Special Investigations and the Security Forces Investigator that you knew \nthe package contained marijuana and that you use marijuana for medicinal \npurposes in the United States. In April 2021, you were [debarred] from U.S. \nmilitary installations by the Air Force and terminated from your employment \nby [Company 1A]. \nA package containing marijuana addressed to Applicant was intercepted by \ncustoms officials. He states he never saw the package. (Tr. at 27.) He acknowledged \nspeaking with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and the Security \nForces Investigator who interviewed him regarding the marijuana. The Air Force \nmemorandum reflects that Applicant knew the package contained marijuana: \nWithout being informed on what the substance was, you indicated to AFOSI \nand the Security Forces Investigator that you knew the package contained \nmarijuana. You also stated that even though you use these substances for \nmedical purposes in the United States, you were fully aware that marijuana, \nCBD Vapes, and THC were illegal in [Country Y] and not authorized on \nUnited States military installations. (GE 3.) \nIn his testimony he explained he told the investigators he had used hemp cream \nfor joint pain. He adamantly denied ever using marijuana. He overheard one the \ninvestigators slip up and say marijuana and given the questions by the investigators \npresumed it was marijuana in the package. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. at 21-24, 29-30.) \nAs a result of the incident, on April 15, 2021, Applicant was debarred from Country \nY and from all U.S. military installations by the Air Force. The debarment order was to \nremain in effect indefinitely. (GE 4.) He maintains he thought he had resigned. He \nsubmitted a memorandum for the record (MFR) on April 21, 2021. In the MFR he states \nhe was informed he needed to go by security forces squadron the next day to be \nquestioned by AFOSI and was advised he should probably seek a lawyer. (GE 5 at 8.)

He states in the MFR: \nI was informed that I was being terminated for an incident of which my only \ninvolvement was my name being associated with a package I have never \nseen or touched. \u2026 I believe this to be a wrongful termination and would \nlike for this to be further investigated. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on May 6, 2022. He \ntestified he completed the SCA and conducted the security clearance interview consistent \nwith the belief he had resigned. (Tr. at 21-24.) He testified he denied the drug allegations \nand being terminated for marijuana because he had never used marijuana and had quit. \nHe described that \u201cwhen the whole thing went down\u201d there was already some frustration \nbecause he was not doing his actual job he went overseas to do. He was working long \nhours in the library and gym with no other work. He felt the allegations about the drugs \nwere tied to his belief he was not supposed to be there. He reached out to his old \nsupervisor, who advised him to quit. (Tr. at 22-24.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant denied with an explanation that he \u201cdeliberately falsified \nmaterial facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), \nexecuted on May 6, 2022, in response to the following question, \"section 134 - \nEmployment Activities...[Company 1A]...Received Discipline or Warning.

(Tr. at 25, 29, 33.)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information.

The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country. \nApplicant received contraband while working overseas on a foreign country\u2019s air \nbase. GE 3 states Applicant knew the content of the contraband package without being \ninformed of its content. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a except for the language \nthat you use marijuana for medicinal purposes in the United States. \nApplicant denies any marijuana use but acknowledges use of hemp for medical \npurposes. There is no evidence of past drug use or that hemp products were illegal. He \ndid not believe his hemp use fell into the use of marijuana or other illegal drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and 16(b) are not applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h. \nGE 3 states Applicant knew the content of the contraband package without being \ninformed of its content. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b), are applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.f. \nApplicant failed to disclose on his SCA and to a DoD investigator that he had been \nterminated by Company 1A and ordered out of the country and debarred from U.S. military \ninstallations.

Applicant knew \nhe had been terminated by Company 1A over the package received overseas. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a \n  person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25.

AG \u00b6 25(a) is not applicable to the SOR \u00b6 2.a language \u201cthat you use marijuana \nfor medicinal purposes in the United States\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c) is applicable to the remaining \nlanguage. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knowingly received a package of \nmarijuana while stationed overseas on foreign country\u2019s air base. He maintains his \ninnocence regarding the package. Applicant\u2019s behavior regarding the package of \nmarijuana raises substantial questions about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. \n1, 2022).

On \nMarch 30, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

I kept the \nrecord open after the hearing until July 25, 2024, to enable Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. He submitted documents from a debt relief company, which were \nadmitted collectively as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJuly 22, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the 18 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.r.

(Tr. at 18-25.) \nApplicant pays his current spouse $200 in child support and pays his $88 a month \nin child support for his daughter from his second marriage. He also covers insurance \npremiums and other items for his children. (Tr. at 23, 26.) \nApplicant testified consistent with his Answer that he had done nothing to reduce \nthe debts alleged on the SOR. He offered that he had been in contact with various debt-\nrelief companies. He contacted one debt-relief company the night before the hearing. GE \n2 shows a screenshot of another debt-relief company he has contacted. He testified his \ncurrent spouse was responsible for paying the bills because he would take 18-month \nassignments in another state. He was at a loss for how to pay his bills when his wife was \nill for a month. (Tr. at 16, 27-30, 33, 36.) \nGE 5, a credit report obtained the day before the hearing, showed Applicant\u2019s debt \nhad increased from the over $34,000 alleged to over $45,000. AE A shows he enrolled \n$46,007 in debt with a debt relief company on July 25, 2024 (the day the record \nclosed)with a $299.50 monthly payment. The majority of the debts became delinquent in \nmid-2022. (GE 5; Tr. 32-34.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations.) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are not applicable. Applicant's financial difficulties \nmay have resulted in part because of his marital difficulties, which were a circumstances \nbeyond his control. However, by his own admission, he has not taken tangible steps to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddress and resolve his delinquent accounts, and he has not demonstrated that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Enrollment with a debt relief company on the day \nthe record closed does not demonstrate that Applicant has adhered to a good-faith effort \nto resolve his debts. An applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(d). See \nISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation \nto resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns based on financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

White, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n03/13/2024 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:  \nApplicant used alcohol to intoxication on a regular basis between 2018 and \nSeptember 2021. His excessive alcohol use led to his cocaine abuse from about April \n2019 to October 2021 while possessing a security clearance. His unsupported evidence \nin mitigation is insufficient to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion under both \nguidelines. His October 2021 non-judicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) for use/possession of a controlled substance has not been mitigated \nunder the personal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP, Item 3) on August 12, 2022. On September 21, 2022, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On February 13, 2023, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD), Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (CAS), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n  \n\n  2  \n  \ndetailing security concerns under the guidelines for alcohol consumption (Guideline G), \nsubstance abuse and drug involvement (Guideline H), and personal conduct (Guideline \nE). This case is adjudicated in accordance with Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \ndated June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated February 14, 2023. I was assigned the \ncase on July 17, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on November 20, 2023, for a hearing on December 4, 2023. The hearing \nwas held by Teams video teleconference as scheduled. I entered the Government\u2019s two \nexhibits (GE) 1-2 into evidence without objection. Applicant did not seek admission of \ndocumentary evidence. The record remained open until December 19, 2023 to allow \nApplicant an opportunity to submit exhibits. No post-hearing exhibits were received by \nDOHA. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 14, 2023. The record closed on \nDecember 19, 2023.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges alcohol consumption, drug involvement, and personal conduct. \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR without explanations. The Government\u2019s \ntwo exhibits were admitted in evidence. (Tr. 16) \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and separated, expecting to file for divorce. In June \n2005, he received a high school diploma. He collected community college credits between \nSeptember 2005 and April 2009, without obtaining a degree. (GE 1 at 7-10) \n \nWhen Applicant signed and certified the e-QIP in August 2022, he anticipated he \nwould start a new job during the month. From May to August 2022, he was a solar panel \ninstaller. From November 2015 to March 2022, he was on active duty in the United States \nNavy (USN). While in the USN, he was granted a security clearance in March 2021. (GE \n1 at 60) He held previous employment positions as a horse stable laborer and nursing \nassistant. (GE 1 at 15-26) \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant married. He separated from his wife in August 2021, but \nis not divorced because of marital issues and locating the right attorney. His wife has two \nchildren from another marriage. (GE 2 at 13; Tr. 20-21) \n \nIn Section 23 of his August 2022 e-QIP (Illegal Use of Drugs), Applicant indicated \nthat in the last seven years, because of depression and stress, he started using cocaine \nabout once a month. He purchased the drug in $50 amounts from cocaine dealers. He \nself-medicated with cocaine a couple of times while on ship deployment, but claimed that \n\n  3  \n  \nhe stopped using the drug in June 2021. The medical records indicate that his last use of \ncocaine was August 18, 2021 (positive drug test), and he explained in his testimony that \nhis last cocaine use was in October 2021. (Tr. 24) He received a Captain\u2019s Mast for the \npositive urine test and additional adverse consequences under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ). (GE 1 at 53-55; GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 20) \n \nAfter his failed drug test in August 2021, Applicant enrolled in treatment at the \nDrug and Alcohol Program Advisor (DAPA) program. He was admitted to inpatient \ntreatment in October 2021, and completed the program in November 2021. He explained \nthat the program helped him find other ways to relieve his depression like riding his \nbicycle, hiking, or running. He admitted using cocaine or crack cocaine while possessing \na security clearance. In February 2022, he received a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. (GE 1 at 53-55; GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 20, 45)  \n \nUnder section 24 of the e-QIP (Alcohol Use), Applicant admitted alcohol use \nbetween August 2018 and September 2021. When he was deployed in 2018, he began \ndrinking excessively when the ship stopped at ports. He drank to intoxication with his \ncoworkers and blacked out every day at the ports, with his most serious use occurring in \nAugust 2021. He realized that he had a problem and sought the month-long treatment \nreferred to in the preceding paragraph. Subsequent to his discharge, he learned that the \nprogram closed because of a lack of funding. Applicant recalled attending a couple of \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings after his November 2021 discharge, but ultimately \nconcluded that he did not need more counseling. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 30-32) \n \nThe medical records summarizing Applicant\u2019s treatment from October to \nNovember 2021 show that his admitting and discharge diagnoses were alcohol and \ncocaine use disorder, categorized as severe according to the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The reason for the admission was Applicant\u2019s \nintoxication and appearing suicidal over the weekend prior to his admission. His drinking \npattern in the period before his admission was four or five shots of whiskey every day with \nmore on the weekend. Applicant\u2019s last use of cocaine was in October 2021. He \nsuccessfully completed the program. He was referred to the Substance Abuse \nRehabilitation Program (SARP), but there is no indication in the record that he attended \nthe program. Applicant recalled the medical providers telling him that as long as he did \nnot have a relapse, he should be fine. They suggested that he utilize different resources \nlike the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) for assistance. He renewed a couple of medications \nfrom the VA. Applicant has not pursued treatment because he does not believe he needs \nhelp. He has handled depression by steering clear of negative people and his family. Now \nhe focuses on work at home rather than seeking negative influences. (GE 2 at 1-3; Tr. 24, \n32-33) \n \nFollowing treatment in November 2021, Applicant consumed a glass of wine in \nAugust 2022, a couple of drinks during the 2022-winter holidays, and a couple of drinks \n\n  4  \n  \nduring the summer and Thanksgiving 2022. The major adjustments in Applicant\u2019s life \nsince November 2021 treatment have been a change from an environment containing \npeople with bad habits to people with healthier lifestyles. He currently works at a job where \nexercise is part of the job. Finally, his job is stress-free, and he has no personality \nproblems with his coworkers. (Tr. 40, 46-47)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with commonsense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption  \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n  \n\n  5  \n  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence. \n \nThe medical records (October to November 2019) contain admission and \ndischarge diagnoses of alcohol and cocaine use disorder, severe. A couple of times, \nApplicant self-medicated with alcohol, or cocaine, or both during deployment. When his \nship stopped at port, he regularly drank to intoxication and blacking out. The evidence \nmeets the disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), and 22(d).  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol use occurred in October 2021, immediately \nbefore he was admitted for inpatient treatment. After his discharge in late November 2021, \nhe resumed drinking albeit at reduced levels. With Applicant\u2019s history of habitual alcohol \nconsumption, his continued use of alcohol casts doubt on his current reliability and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 25(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant contended in his answer to the SOR that the treatment program helped \nhim find other ways to deal with stress. What is missing from his case in mitigation is \nindependent evidence that reinforces his claims about modified consumption and other \nchanges in his life. Applicant only receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b623(b).  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d) applies only in part. Though the record shows that Applicant \ncompleted treatment in late November 2021, there is no record that he participated in \n\n  6  \n  \nrecommended aftercare. In sum, he has not presented a clear pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence.  \n \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding sensitive position. \n \nApplicant began using cocaine in 2019. He used the drug about once a month \nuntil October 2021, when he tested positive for cocaine. After his drug test, he enrolled in \nthe inpatient treatment program in October 2021. But he did not participate in aftercare. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), 25(d), 259(e) and 25(f) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n\n  7  \n  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply for the same reasons expressed under AG \u00b6 23(a). \nApplicant has furnished no independent evidence, i.e., aftercare, or follow-up counseling, \nor knowledge by a third party of Applicant\u2019s current drug and alcohol use, to support his \nclaims of abstinence or control under the drug involvement guideline.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has not been fully established. Though Applicant appears to have \ntaken some steps to remove himself from the drug environment, he failed to provide \nsubstantiating evidence to firmly establish he has overcome illegal drugs and alcohol, and \nis on the road to long-lasting recovery. Lastly, Applicant did not provide a signed \nstatement acknowledging that future drug use could be grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation or further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are:  \n\n  8  \n  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information \u2026 \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \nGuideline E addresses conduct of a questionable nature, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to obey rules and regulations which raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment and ability to protect classified information. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine resulted \nin a positive urinalysis test in August 2021. When this test result is considered with all \nother available information, it supports a whole person assessment of questionable \njudgment and unreliability within the scope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). \n \nThe potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment; and  \n \n\n  9  \n  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) has not been established even though the misconduct is unlikely to \nrecur. Receiving non-judicial punishment in October 2021 under Article 15 of the UCMJ \nfor wrongful possession of a controlled substance in the military while holding a security \nclearance was a major offense that resulted in Applicant being discharged from the USN \nin February 2022 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies on a limited basis to Applicant\u2019s acknowledgement of his \nalcohol and drug-related behavior and completion of a treatment and counseling, but there \nis no evidence of voluntarily seeking support to prevent a recurrence of the past alcohol-\nand drug-related conduct. Moreover, there appear to be lingering issues with his \nestranged wife that he has not resolved.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guidelines for dur involvement, alcohol \nconsumption, and personal conduct in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):   \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the \nspecific guidelines in the context of the entire record. Applicant is 37 years old and \nseparated. Between 2018 and October 2021, he was involved in excessive alcohol and \ncocaine use. Prior to his admission in October 2021, he was drinking heavily, and there \nis sufficient reason to believe he was using cocaine regularly. Though he successfully \n\n  10  \n  \ncompleted the inpatient treatment program in November 2021, there is no tangible \nevidence that he was involved in any significant aftercare.  \n \n \nFollowing a careful examination of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder the alcohol consumption, drug involvement, and personal conduct guidelines, I \nconclude that Applicant has failed to sufficiently mitigate the remaining adverse security \nconcerns arising from the guidelines  \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:   \n   \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT   \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access \nto classified information or a sensitive position. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \n \n \n__________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered 12 documents, marked as Applicant exhibit\u2019s (AE) 1-12, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 1, 2024. Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations (except for the second sentence in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which she denied), with detailed explanations. Those admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 26 years old. She was born in the United States (US). She also was a dual Kuwaiti citizen by virtue of her father\u2019s Kuwait citizenship. She moved to Kuwait with her family when she was about six-months-old. She lived there until she was two- years-old when she moved back to the US, where she has remained. At one time, she held both Kuwaiti and US passports. As explained in detail infra, she destroyed her Kuwaiti passport and believes she is no longer considered a Kuwaiti citizen.

The DCSA CAS acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implement by the DOD on June 8, \n2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR with an undated response, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as hearing exhibit (HE) I, and its disclosure letter was marked as HE II. Without \nobjection, I took administrative notice about factual information concerning Kuwait as \npresented in Department Counsel\u2019s request and the accompanying background \ninformation as reflected in HE III. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered 12 \ndocuments, marked as Applicant exhibit\u2019s (AE) 1-12, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 1, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations (except for \nthe second sentence in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which she denied), with detailed explanations. \nThose admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 26 years old. She was born in the United States (US). She also was \na dual Kuwaiti citizen by virtue of her father\u2019s Kuwait citizenship. She moved to Kuwait \nwith her family when she was about six-months-old. She lived there until she was two-\nyears-old when she moved back to the US, where she has remained. At one time, she \nheld both Kuwaiti and US passports. As explained in detail infra, she destroyed her \nKuwaiti passport and believes she is no longer considered a Kuwaiti citizen. (Tr. 21-22, \n25, 31-33, 61; GE 1; AE 2-3)  \nApplicant attended elementary school, middle school, high school, and college in \nthe US. She graduated from college in May 2020. She has worked for the same \ngovernment contractor as an engineer since July 2020. (Tr. 22-23, 25; GE 1; AE 1) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s father and mother are dual \ncitizens of Kuwait and the US and that her father resides in Kuwait; that she received a \nscholarship from the Kuwaiti government, valued at approximately $150,000, to attend \ncollege in the US and that because of that scholarship, she feels obligated to Kuwait; \nand that she had approximately $9,000 in a Kuwaiti bank account derived from \nscholarship money provided by the Kuwaiti government. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) \nForeign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Kuwait and is a Kuwaiti citizen. He came to the US \nfor college. He received the same type of scholarship his daughter would later receive \nto fund his college education. While living in the US, he met Applicant\u2019s mother. They \nwould marry and have four children, with Applicant being the youngest. They remain \nmarried. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1996.

He worked in that position for approximately 25 years when he retired. He \nreceives a government pension from that employment. Upon his death, Applicant\u2019s \nmother will then receive the pension. (Tr. 33, 41-43, 57, 59; GE 1) \nSince Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s retirement, he splits his time between Kuwait and \nDubai, where he manages or owns a retail store. Applicant believes he rents \napartments in both locations. She currently sees her father about once a year when he \ncomes to the US. She talks to him as little as once a month to as frequently as once a \nweek. He provides her no financial support. While he was working for the Kuwaiti \ngovernment and his family resided in the US, Applicant only saw her father several \ntimes a year when he came back to the US. (Tr. 29-31, 44) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a native-born US citizen. Her father was a chief master \nsergeant in the US Air Force, and she lived throughout the US and in several foreign \ncountries as a military dependent. She met and later married Applicant\u2019s father when he \nwas in the US as a college student. At some point, after their marriage, they moved to \nKuwait where her husband secured a job. She lived in Kuwait for about 10 years. She \nmoved back to the US for the birth of all her children so they would be US citizens. \nAbout six months after Applicant was born in 1998, they moved as a family back to \nKuwait. The family remained there until Applicant was two years old when the family, \nexcept for her husband, moved back to the US to the same area where Applicant\u2019s \nmother\u2019s family lived. The family has remained there ever since, never changing their \nresidence back to Kuwait. (Tr. 41-42, 57-58, 61; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that she obtained dual citizenship with Kuwaiti when \nshe lived there because she wanted to protect her children in the event something \nhappened to her husband. If he were deceased or incapacitated while they lived in \nKuwait and she was not a Kuwaiti citizen, she could have faced legal difficulties if she \ntried to relocate the family back to the US. She also stated that she moved the family \nback to the US when Applicant was two years old because she wanted her children to \nbe educated in the US. She has resided in the US since that time. She works as a \nbookkeeper for a local school. She last visited Kuwait in 2018 to see her husband. She \nexplained that the separate residencies of her and her husband worked for the family. \nHe was able to work and provide a good income for the family and she was able to live \nand educate the children in the US. As a Kuwaiti citizen, she is entitled to her husband\u2019s \npension upon his death. (Tr. 31, 43, 57-59) \nApplicant attended college from 2016 to 2020 when she graduated with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. She was able to fund her education with a scholarship she was \ngranted by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Higher Education. She qualified for the scholarship \nbecause of her relationship to her father, a native born Kuwaiti citizen. Her father and \nher three siblings all previously qualified for the same scholarship. She estimated the \nvalue of the scholarship at approximately $150,000. It paid for tuition, books and \nequipment, provided her a monthly stipend, and health insurance while she attended \nschool. The guidelines for being awarded and maintaining the scholarship are set forth \nin AE 6 (which were in effect when Applicant applied) and AE 7 (which are the current \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidelines). Nothing in either set of guidelines obligates Applicant to any sort of \n\u201cpayback\u201d to the Kuwaiti government for receiving and using the scholarship. While she \nwas in school, she was required to contact the Kuwaiti consulate yearly to ensure she \ncontinued to follow the prescribed guidelines. After her graduation, except for one \ncontact with the consulate about the end of her health insurance benefits, she has had \nno further contact with any representative of the Kuwaiti government about her \nscholarship. Her siblings have never been contacted by the Kuwaiti government about \nany further obligation to it because of their scholarships. She believes she has no \nobligation to the Kuwaiti government resulting from the scholarship. (Tr. 25, 33-36; AE \n6-7) \nApplicant\u2019s father established a Kuwaiti bank account for Applicant in order to \ndeposit the scholarship funds to which she would have access during her college \ncareer. During her background interview in January 2022, she told the investigator the \nestimated funds remaining in the account was approximately $9,000. In June 2020, \nApplicant contacted the Kuwaiti bank and arranged to have the remaining funds which \nwere only $3,702 wire-transferred to her US bank account. Her US bank statement from \nJune 2020 corroborates her action. Additionally, she provided text correspondence with \nthe Kuwaiti bank that shows her successful efforts to close that bank account on July 4, \n2020. She has no other bank accounts or assets of any kind in Kuwait. (Tr. 37-39; AE 6-\n10) \nApplicant explained that 2020 was a very difficult year for her because her father \nhad some health issues, and she was worried about him and being able to see him in \nKuwait if his medical condition worsened. She had that frame of mind when she \nunderwent her background interview in January 2020. This led her to state that she \nwould retain her Kuwaiti passport for ease of travel to Kuwait. She also stated she \nwould not renounce her Kuwaiti citizenship because she wanted to maintain it while her \nfather was alive. She further stated she felt a moral obligation to maintain her Kuwaiti \ncitizenship because of the scholarship she received. At the same time, she told the \ninvestigator that she is a loyal US born-citizen who planned to remain in the US \npermanently. She prefers the US to Kuwait in every way and is completely loyal to the \nUS. (Tr. 40; GE 2; SOR answer) \nSince the time of that background interview, Applicant has taken actions to show \nthat she has no obligation of loyalty to Kuwait. She researched her dual citizen status \nand discovered that because she kept her US citizenship past the age of 18 years old, \nshe is no longer considered a Kuwaiti citizen. She provided documentation showing that \nshe destroyed her Kuwaiti passport on September 19, 2023. The documentation \nincluded a declaration from her facility security officer attesting to the passport \ndestruction, which he witnessed. She testified that her last visit to Kuwait was in 2018 to \nsee her father. Her gross annual salary is over $100,000. She recently bought a home \nin the US with a value of approximately $400,000. Her savings account has \napproximately $50,000 and she has a retirement account of some unknown value. \nHypothetically, if she were asked by the Kuwaiti government to repay her scholarship \nmoney, she would sell her house and use those proceeds to make the payment.

She is aware of the allegations stated in the SOR. She described Applicant as an \nhonest, transparent and patriotic person. She recommended granting Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. (AE 11) \nAdministrative Notice-Kuwait \nThe United States has a long history of friendship and cooperation, rooted in \nshared values, democratic traditions, and institutional relationship with Kuwait. Kuwait is \nan important partner in US counterterrorism efforts, including efforts to block financing \nof terrorist groups. No negative information about Kuwait is contained in the background \ninformation supporting the administrative notice request. (HE III; AE 12) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd.

The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. In considering the nature of the government, an \nadministrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to \ngrant clearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area \nwhere family members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and     \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). See also ISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, \n2019) (\u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard.). Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s ties to Kuwait are \nsufficient to establish a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a is established because of Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s \ncurrent and past ties to Kuwait. Applicant\u2019s mother is a long-standing resident and \nnative-born citizen of the United States. She has not visited Kuwait since 2018 and \nretains her Kuwaiti citizenship only to benefit from her husband\u2019s pension upon his \ndeath. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) do not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c is established. Applicant was the recipient of a \ncollege scholarship from the Kuwaiti government valued at approximately $150,000. \nShe previously expressed feeling an obligation toward Kuwait for providing the \nscholarship. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) all substantially apply. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d is not established. Applicant documented that she closed the Kuwaiti bank account \nwhere she had received her scholarship funds and has no other foreign assets.  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nGiven the nature of the relationship between Kuwait and the United States and \nthe limited contact that Applicant has with her father who lives part-time in Kuwait, it is \nunlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of her father and those of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \nApplicant has met her burden to establish her \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She was born a U.S. citizen and has lived and \ngone to school only in the United States. She has a good job here, owns a home, and \nhas substantial assets. Her connection to Kuwait is only through her father. A friend \nattests to her loyalty and trustworthiness. Even though Applicant greatly benefited from \nher Kuwaiti-funded scholarship, there is no evidence to support that she is anyway \nobligated to their government because of that scholarship. She credibly explained why \nshe told the investigator that she felt obligated to Kuwait, but that she no longer feels \nthat way. The evidence supports that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United \nStates and would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The factors tending to support \ngranting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing towards \ndenying her clearance. I considered her minimal connection to Kuwait against the \nstrong ties she has to this country, thereby demonstrating her longstanding loyalty to the \nUnited States and that there are no foreign influence concerns. Therefore, she provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were either \nnot established or were mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guidelines note several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and other record evidence establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). For AG \u00b6 25(f), though Applicant admitted his \ndrug use occurred \u201cwhile granted access to classified information,\u201d there is insufficient \nevidence to make a finding with respect to this aspect of the allegation, as defined in ISCR \nCase No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), affirmed in ISCR Case No. 22-01661 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2023). I find that Applicant used marijuana \u201cwhile holding a \nsensitive position\u201d consistent with the Appeal Board\u2019s analysis in the above cited case. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted use and cultivation of marijuana, and his misuse of Adderall while \nholding a sensitive position are corroborated by the following: his detailed admissions in \nhis SCAs, his June 2022 investigative interview, and evidence he was granted a secret \nsecurity clearance and signed a DOD nondisclosure agreement in November 2018. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d appears to address the same disqualifying conduct \nalready alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Both allegations are listed below for ease of comparison: \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: You used prescription medication Adderall that was not \nprescribed to you, from about February 2021 to about March 2021, with \nvarying frequency, while granted access to classified information or holding \na sensitive position. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: You used prescription medication Adderall that was not \nprescribed to you, from about February 2021 to about March 2021 with \nvarying frequency. \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b is sufficient to allege disqualifying conduct within the \nscope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f). SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges the same disqualifying conduct, but \nonly within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(a).

See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.d, therefore, is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nGuideline H lists conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate security concerns raised \nby disqualifying conditions listed above. The following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not established. Applicant used marijuana from about \nMarch 2015 to about October 2020, including use and cultivation of marijuana after he \nwas granted a security clearance, and while holding a sensitive position. He also admitted \nmisusing the prescription medication Adderall as recently as March 2021 while holding a \nsensitive position. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana in his first SCA, completed in February 2017. \nIn that SCA, he admitted using marijuana from March 2015 through November 2016, and \nstated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he was career-focused \nand would not do anything to jeopardize it, or the defense company for whom he worked. \nBased on these assurances, the CAS granted him a security clearance in November \n2018. Despite holding a secret security clearance, he continued to use marijuana \u201con rare \noccasions\u201d with friends, up until about October 2020, as he disclosed in his second SCA \ncompleted in May 2022. His involvement with illegal drugs or controlled substances was \nnot infrequent; nor did it happen under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He has \nalso maintained continuous relations with the same friends with whom he used drugs, \nthough he states he has recently distanced himself from these friends. He has not \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement or substance \nmisuse in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cultivation and use of illegal drugs after being granted a security \nclearance reflect poor judgment and raise questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. His statements and evidence are insufficient to overcome concerns and \ndoubts about his current judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. 18-19, 28, \n31; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s had three delinquent accounts that \nwere charged off. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant recently incurred a significant \namount of debt that is in the process of being resolved. However, he is given credit for \ntaking the initiative to begin resolving his delinquent accounts in March 2022 when he \ncontacted the debt relief firm. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant took out the $10,862 loan, in part, to pay medical expenses related to his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nchronic medical condition. His medical issues were a circumstance beyond his control. \nThis mitigating condition is given less weight because of the other delinquent debts that \nhe incurred. He admits to letting his financial situation get out of control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant realized he needed to get control of his financial \nsituation. He hired the debt relief firm in March 2022 before the SOR was issued. He \nhas been making timely payments to them. The debt relief firm is negotiating \nsettlements and the debts are being resolved. Applicant is a making a good-faith effort \nto resolve his delinquent student loan accounts. \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \ntimely adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant has worked \nfor the same defense contractor since 2017. I also considered that Applicant took the \ninitiative to resolve his financial situation. He entered into a debt settlement agreement \nwith the debt relief firm in March 2022 prior to the SOR being issued. All three SOR \ndebts are included in the agreement. He is in the process of paying on the settlement \nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He resolved another debt that was included in the \ndebt settlement agreement but was not alleged in the SOR. He is making timely \npayments to the debt relief agency. They are negotiating settlements for the remaining \nSOR debts in a methodical and reasonable manner. Applicant also closed out several \ncredit card accounts. He has only one open credit card with a low maximum balance \nthat he uses for emergencies. He is making a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. He proved that he is reliable and trustworthy. Security concerns under \nfinancial considerations are mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

About a month after his 2020 DUI arrest, Applicant sought and received mental-\nhealth and alcohol-related counseling from a neural therapist until about December \n2021. He stopped attending this counseling because he could not afford it. He \ncontemplated attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings but has not done so \nbecause he considered the aforementioned mental-health and alcohol-related \ncounseling to be sufficient. He has access to alcohol-related treatment that he can \nafford through Veterans Affairs (VA), but he does not know how to begin the process \nand has not looked into it.

While he claimed that he was never told to abstain from alcohol or that he suffered \nfrom an alcohol use disorder, he did abstain from alcohol for about six months after his \n2016 DUI, and from March 2020 until December 2023. During his personal subject \ninterviews in late 2021 and early 2022, Applicant told a DOD investigator that he vowed \nto stop drinking and had no desire to start drinking again. However, in December 2023, \nhe had a glass of wine with his wife to celebrate his wedding anniversary. He also had a \nglass of wine on New Year\u2019s Eve 2023. He acknowledged that he should not be \nconsuming alcohol but, paradoxically, is not sure whether he will abstain in the future \nbecause he does not have an urge to drink and thinks he is in control. He claims that \ncounseling has taught him to use more healthy coping mechanisms. He also claimed \nthat he has not driven after consuming alcohol since his 2020 DUI. (Tr. 29-31, 49-62, \n73-82; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has made poor choices involving alcohol in the \npast, but he believes that he has remedied the underlying issues that caused them. He \nclaimed that he had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues that contributed to \nhis overdrinking. Sadly, within a six-month period prior to his 2016 DUI, his sister, \ngrandmother, and best friend passed away. He claimed that these losses contributed to \nhis mental-health issues, which resulted in him drinking more. He claimed that he does \nwell at work, has never shown up to work intoxicated, and has been entrusted to be a \nunion representative for about 700 people over the last eight years. (Tr. 22-25, 29, 35, \n51-52; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUIs in 2007, 2014, 2016, and 2020 \nafter drinking too much and driving. He acknowledged that he often drank too much \nalcohol. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions are established, and the burden \nshifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nOn at least four occasions over a span of about 13 years, Applicant has \nconsumed far too much alcohol, driven a vehicle while intoxicated or under the \ninfluence, and been arrested for DUI. Although it has been almost four years since \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related arrest, his pattern of impaired driving, with \nsignificant gaps between alcohol-related incidents, casts doubt on whether these \nincidents are likely to recur. His willingness to begin drinking again after three years of \nabstinence, albeit in moderation, despite acknowledging that he probably should not, \nalso gives me pause about his current judgment. For these reasons, he has not met his \nburden to show that the behavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He also has not met his burden of \nshowing that he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) do not apply. \nApplicant has not met his burden of proving that he completed a treatment or \ncounseling program and that he then followed treatment recommendations. While he \nclaimed that he completed ADAPT and SARP after his 2007 DUI, he clearly did not \nfollow treatment recommendations when he continued to binge drink and drive while \nintoxicated. There is no evidence that he successfully completed the treatment program \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthat he began in 2020. The only evidence he presented is that he stopped that \ntreatment at some point because he could not afford the cost. AG \u00b6 23(c) does not \napply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant drove while intoxicated on at least four separate occasions between \n2007 and 2020. The above-referenced disqualifying condition is established, and the \nburden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the reasons I provided in my analysis of potential mitigating conditions under \nGuideline G, I do not find that Applicant\u2019s DUIs are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does \nnot apply. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) has some applicability. Applicant has not driven under the influence \nof alcohol or engaged in other criminal behavior in about four years. There is also some \nevidence of a good employment record, such as his being awarded a role as a union \nrepresentative. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service. However, I find that the totality of the evidence, \nincluding his DUIs, his willingness to continue to drink, and his failed efforts to \neffectively modify his alcohol consumption after earlier DUIs, leaves me with questions \nand doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption or criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nWITHDRAWN \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant and the \nindividuals remained anonymous or on a first-name basis. He could only recall two \nindividuals who he met more than once, and he did not know their last names. He \nconcealed his behavior from his then wife and other individuals until about 2010. After \n2010, he and his wife had an open marriage, and she accepted that he had multiple \npartners outside the marriage. She also had at least one extramarital partner. (Tr. at 19\u00ad\n20, 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE M) \nApplicant and his then wife had an agreement that they would not have sex \nwithin 24 hours of either one of them having sex with someone else. He violated that \nagreement and sexually assaulted his then wife in about 2011 and again in 2012 while \nshe was asleep and within 24 hours of a sexual encounter. In 2011, he engaged in oral \nsex with her without her consent, and in 2012, he digitally penetrated her without her \nconsent. (Tr. at 21-23, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE M) \nApplicant and his second wife received couples\u2019 counseling, and he received \ncounseling for sexual addiction from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) from 2012 \nto 2014. He also attended Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) meetings. He attributes the \nassaults to his undiagnosed and untreated bipolar disorder and the incorrect \nmedication, which made him hypersexual. (Tr. at 20-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2, 3, 5; AE M) He wrote in his response to the SOR: \nThe sexual assaults were committed during a time when I was \nmisdiagnosed and prescribed an antidepressant that exacerbated my \nmanic episodes. Under proper diagnosis and proper medication, these \nevents would not have occurred, and will not occur again. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife became involved in an ongoing extramarital relationship in \nabout 2011.

(Tr. at 18-19, 27-29, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, AE K) \nApplicant has received treatment from a psychiatrist since 2014. He received \nseveral diagnoses over the years, but he has consistently been diagnosed with bipolar II \ndisorder. He was prescribed different medications based on that diagnosis. He told the \npsychiatrist in 2019 that he was disappointed his ex-wife chose to end the marriage \nafter he sexually assaulted her. He felt that since the assaults occurred before he \nreceived the correct diagnosis and treatment, she should have been more forgiving. In \nJuly 2021, the psychiatrist diagnosed him with bipolar II disorder; fetishistic disorder \n(non-living objects); amphetamine-type use disorder, intermittent relapse/remission; and \ncannabis use disorder, mild. In January 2023, he was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, \nstable; amphetamine-type use disorder, in sustained remission; cannabis use disorder, \nmild; and fetishistic disorder (non-living objects).

He stated that he did not believe he used marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance because his security clearance was no longer valid \nas of December 2019. He thought that his employer permitted his marijuana use \nbecause he did not have a security clearance.

The psychologist also found that \n\u201c[d]espite finding substantial relief from mood stabilizers, [Applicant] continued to \nstruggle with impulsive and compulsive behaviors.\u201d Regarding Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior, the psychologist found: \n[Applicant\u2019s test scores] are typically seen as consistent with the scores of \nthose who engage in or have engaged in sexually compulsive behavior. \nHe admitted his sexual behavior has caused problems for him in his life, \nthat he has felt distressed about his sexual behaviors, and that he tried \nand failed to stop engaging in distressing sexual behavior in the past. He \nadmitted he is often preoccupied with sexual thoughts and that, \nhistorically, his sexual behavior has created problems for him and his \nfamily and emotionally hurt those in his life. He admitted he has sought \ntreatment for sexual behavior problems. [Applicant] admitted he has had \nmultiple sexual partners at the same time and has engaged in risky sex \neven though he knew it could cause him harm. He admitted he had \ncruised public places, such as parks, for sex with strangers so that his \nsexual behavior has put him at risk for lewd conduct or public indecency. \n \n \n \n*\n*\n* \nFortunately, through specific treatment for sexual issues, participation in \nSAA, effective mood regulation, and personal growth and maturity, \n[Applicant] now seems to have gained a fair measure of control over his \nsexual behaviors. He has now been monogamous in his current \nrelationship since October 2023 suggesting this condition is in early \nremission. \nThe psychologist concluded: \nBased on all the available data, [Applicant\u2019s] mental health symptoms \nappear to be well controlled with medication at this time. He likely still \nexperiences mild mood symptoms but he has developed excellent insight \nconcerning bipolar disorder, is able to manage his symptoms and has a \ntrack record of seeking help when needed. [Applicant] no longer uses \nmethamphetamine and given his limited use history and the time since last \nuse, the risk he will relapse seems quite low. Likewise, he does not seem \nto be at risk for returning to marijuana use. [Applicant] has struggled with \nhis sexual identity and behavior for most of his adult life and this seems to \nbe an ongoing challenge for him. He has however, gained much through \nhis 10 year history of treatment and he has shown a pattern of increased \nself-control over the last several years.

(AE F, H-J) \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) \nThe DSM-5 is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental \nhealth professionals in the United States. The following is summarized from the DSM-5: \nBipolar II Disorder \nBipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood \nepisodes consisting of one or more major depressive episodes and at least one \nhypomanic episode. The major depressive episode must last at least two weeks, and \nthe hypomanic episode must last at least four days to meet the diagnostic criteria. \n \n \nMajor Depressive Episode\nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two \nweeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in \nnearly all activities. \n \n \nHypomanic Episode \nA distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable \nmood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least four \nconsecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day. \nThe episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is \nuncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic. The disturbance in mood and \nthe change in functioning are observable by others. The episode is not severe enough \nto cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate \nhospitalization. \nAdjustment Disorder \nThe essential feature of adjustment disorders is the presence of emotional or \nbehavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor. By definition, the \ndisturbance in adjustment disorders begins within three months of onset of a stressor \nand lasts no longer than six months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there \nmay be multiple stressors (e.g., marked business difficulties and marital problems). \nStressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling \nsexual relationships) or continuous (e.g., a persistent painful illness with increasing \ndisability, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood). Adjustment disorders are associated \nwith an increased risks of suicide attempts and completed suicide. \nSymptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of \nthe following: \n1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the \nstressor, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that \nmight influence symptom severity and presentation. \n2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of \nfunctioning. \nSubstance Use Disorder  \nThe essential feature of a substance use disorder (including cannabis use \ndisorder and amphetamine use disorder) is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and \nphysiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance \ndespite significant substance-related problems. \nFetishistic Disorder  \nThe paraphilic basis of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive \nuse of or dependence on nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically \nnongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal. A diagnosis \nof fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial \nrole impairment. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes.

AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h cross-alleges that Applicant \u201cintend[s] to use marijuana in the future.\u201d \nThat information is a valid allegation under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline, but it does not allege any additional personal conduct that is not already \ncovered under SOR \u00b6 1.g.

Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment \nand an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not \nperfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under the sexual behavior guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e cross-allege that Applicant received counseling and \ntreatment and was diagnosed with certain conditions. Counseling is a mitigating factor. \nIt does not raise a personal conduct disqualifying condition. The diagnoses may be valid \nallegations under the psychological conditions and drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guidelines, but they do not constitute personal conduct by Applicant. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant engaged in problematic conduct for more than three decades. Some of \nhis conduct was criminal, ranging from relatively minor (sex in public, illegal drugs), to \nmoderate (lying on SF 86 and during background interview in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001), to serious (sexual assault). He used illegal drugs while holding a security \nclearance, lied about it on two occasions, and only came clean when he realized that \nhis psychiatrist knew about his illegal drug use and the DoD had sought his medical \nrecords. He then continued to use illegal drugs and have indiscriminate high-risk sexual \nencounters. I am unable to find that problematic conduct is unlikely to recur. His conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are sufficiently applicable \nto overcome Applicant\u2019s three decades of problematic conduct. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used methamphetamine and marijuana. He was \ndiagnosed by his treating psychiatrist with amphetamine-type use disorder, in sustained \nremission; and cannabis use disorder, mild. He told a background investigator in \nJanuary 2022 that he would continue to use marijuana but would stop if he was required \nto for his employment or security clearance. In his February 2023 response to \ninterrogatories, he wrote that he was using marijuana about once or twice a week, but \nthat, \u201cIf required, in order to regain my clearance, I would be willing to give it up.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), 25(d), and 25(g) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe analysis under personal conduct also applies here. Applicant used illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance, lied about it on two occasions, and only came \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclean when he realized that his psychiatrist knew about his illegal drug use and the DoD \nhad sought his medical records. He then continued to use illegal drugs until April 2023. \nI am unable to find that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nApplicant has been involved in a series of compulsive, high-risk sexual \nencounters with consenting adults since about 1992. He met the individuals in hotels, \nhouses, public restrooms, public parks, and adult bookstores. He stopped using public \nplaces in about 2014. He concealed his behavior from his then wife and other \nindividuals until about 2010. He sexually assaulted his then wife in about 2011 and \n2012. All the above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant blamed his sexual assaults on a misdiagnosis and improper \nmedication. He received a proper diagnosis in 2014 and different medication. There is \nno evidence of any additional sexual assaults since 2012, but the compulsive, self-\ndestructive, high-risk sexual behavior continued until he married in October 2023. \nApplicant has received treatment for years, but the sexual assaults are too serious, and \nthe other problematic sexual behavior too recent, to consider his sexual behavior \nmitigated. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that \nApplicant \u201creceived counseling for sexual addiction and marital issues\u201d from 2012 to\u00ad\n2014. That does not raise a disqualifying condition under Guideline I. The language in \nSOR \u00b6 3.a referencing SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia and \ndelusional disorder (not present in this case) clearly impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nand trustworthiness, and by their very nature raise security concerns, and can be \naccepted as such without further elaboration by the mental health professional: Other \nconditions may require elaboration by the mental health professional as to how the \ncondition may impair the individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nBipolar II disorder falls into the category of conditions that by their very nature \nraise security concerns. See, e.g., USAF-M Case No. 23-00056-R at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 4, \n2024). AG \u00b6 28(b) is applicable to the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. \nWhile not listed among the seven per se psychological diagnoses that raise \nsecurity concerns, amphetamine-type use disorder and cannabis use disorder impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness because the diagnoses stem from \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 28(b) is applicable to those diagnoses. \nAbsent elaboration by the psychologist or another mental health professional that \nadjustment disorder and fetishistic disorder may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, I am unable to find AG \u00b6 28(b) applicable to those diagnoses. The \nlanguage in SOR \u00b6 3.a referencing those diagnoses is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby. or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant does not dispute that he has bipolar II disorder. He blamed his sexual \nassaults on a misdiagnosis and improper medication. He received a proper diagnosis of \nbipolar II disorder in 2014 and different medication. There is no evidence of any \nadditional sexual assaults since 2012, but he has no excuse for all the problematic and \ncriminal behavior that came after 2014. I found Applicant\u2019s psychological evaluation to \nbe helpful. I tend to believe most of the psychologist\u2019s findings, except for his finding \nthat \u201cbased on the available data and given his current mental status and track record of \nsuccessfully managing a clearance in the past, it is unlikely that any of his conditions \ncould negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment while working in a \ncleared setting or around classified information.\u201d I could not disagree more with that \nopinion. Three months of monogamy without problematic conduct was enough to sway \nthe psychologist. Thirty years of problematic conduct is enough to convince me that \nApplicant\u2019s psychological issues are not yet mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, D, H, and I in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old full-time employee of a defense contractor. He received his high school diploma in May 2008, and subsequently attended community college for about a year before leaving without graduating. He has never been married and does not have children. (GE 1; Tr. 21-30) Applicant was initially hired in September 2022 as a full-time pipefitter earning $19.75 per hour. He was released from the position in about February 2023 after he was not initially granted a security clearance. After about three months of unemployment, he testified he was re-hired by the same defense contractor in May 2023, and currently works as a full-time sheet metal fabricator earning $21.23 per hour. (GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 26-29) Applicant previously worked as a truck driver for three different non-defense employers from about June 2016 to about September 2022. He testified his annual earnings for work as a truck driver in 2016 ranged between $40,000 and $45,000. From 2017 until he left his last job as a truck driver in September 2022, he testified he earned between $52,000 and $53,000. He testified his delivery work slowed down during the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted his pay. He was paid based on the load and deliveries, and with few deliveries he was paid less. As a result, he fell behind on some bills. (Tr. 27-2",

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old full-time employee of a defense contractor. He received \nhis high school diploma in May 2008, and subsequently attended community college for \nabout a year before leaving without graduating. He has never been married and does not \nhave children. (GE 1; Tr. 21-30) \nApplicant was initially hired in September 2022 as a full-time pipefitter earning \n$19.75 per hour. He was released from the position in about February 2023 after he was \nnot initially granted a security clearance. After about three months of unemployment, he \ntestified he was re-hired by the same defense contractor in May 2023, and currently works \nas a full-time sheet metal fabricator earning $21.23 per hour. (GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 26-29) \nApplicant previously worked as a truck driver for three different non-defense \nemployers from about June 2016 to about September 2022. He testified his annual \nearnings for work as a truck driver in 2016 ranged between $40,000 and $45,000. From \n2017 until he left his last job as a truck driver in September 2022, he testified he earned \nbetween $52,000 and $53,000. He testified his delivery work slowed down during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted his pay. He was paid based on the load \nand deliveries, and with few deliveries he was paid less. As a result, he fell behind on \nsome bills. (Tr. 27-29, 49-51) \nApplicant gets paid weekly and his current net or take-home pay is about $628 \neach week. (Tr. at 55) He participates in his employer\u2019s 401(k) plan and saves a portion \nof his earnings each month. He has two savings accounts, one with a balance of about \n$1,800. He also minimized his living expenses by moving out of his independent \napartment to live with his sister. He pays her about $400 per month for rent, which \nincludes all utilities. He has not taken on any new debts. He owns an older car, \nmanufactured in 2001, and a 2011 motorcycle both without debt. He testified he used his \nprofit of about $25,000 from the sale of his home in June 2023 to pay off his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. at 64) He has not received formal counseling, but he maintains a budget, which \nhe plans to revise to reflect his current pay level. (Tr. at 59) He testified he is able to meet \nhis financial obligations though for some months he has less money remaining over. (Tr. \n55-60) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant disclosed he has not yet filed his 2022 federal and \nstate income tax returns because he is missing a W2 from his previous employer. He is \nseeking a tax professional to help him navigate this issue. He intends to file his 2023 \nincome tax returns on time.

The evidence regarding the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($10,207): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt for a car \nhe purchased for himself, a 2017 Ford. He fell behind on payments during the COVID-19 \npandemic because of cut-backs in truck deliveries and cargo loads. His pay as a truck \ndriver largely depended upon the weight and number of deliveries to factories and plants. \nDuring the pandemic, numerous factories and plants closed down, which \u201cdrastically \nreduced\u201d the number of deliveries and loads he was able to make. He testified his hours \nwere reduced significantly at times. For this debt he testified he was about four payments \nbehind, and the creditor was unwilling to work with him. (GE 2  at 1-2) In June 2023, he \npaid off this debt with proceeds from the sale of his home. (GE 3 at 2; AE C; Tr. 27, 49-\n51) This debt is resolved.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,541): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified \nthis was one of two car loans he cosigned for a long-time friend who needed help getting \nstarted after leaving the military. This car was a sports car, and unsuitable for use in \ninclement winter weather. His friend wrecked this car and it was deemed a total loss. His \nfriend ultimately lost his job, and was unable to pay. Applicant paid off this debt in June \n2023 with proceeds from the sale of his home. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4; AE B; and Tr. 34-\n36, 50-51) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,823): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified \nthis loan was a smaller consolidation loan to pay off smaller debts when he was younger. \nHe fell behind on payments in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic due to reduced pay \nas discussed above. He paid off this debt in June 2023 with proceeds from the sale of his \nhome. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 5; and Tr. 45-49) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,019): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified \nhe incurred this debt for the purchase of a refrigerator and stove for his first new home. \nHe testified he set up automatic payments for this bill, but believed the credit card he used \nexpired, and automatic payments stopped. He did not remember to reset automatic \npayments, which would have been in the 2020 timeframe during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n(Tr. at 41) He experienced financial problems for many of his bills due to reduction in work \nassignments and pay as discussed above. He addressed this debt when he learned about \nits existence during his interview with investigators in October 2022. He stated he \ncontacted the creditor immediately after the interview and begin working on payment \narrangements. He ultimately paid off this delinquent debt in June 2023 with proceeds from \nthe sale of his home. (GE 3 at 3; AE A; Tr. 40-42) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($8,347): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified \nthis was the second car loan he cosigned for a long-time friend who needed help getting \nstarted after leaving the military, discussed in SOR \u00b6 1.b above. This car was a four-wheel \ndrive car suitable for winter. He testified he learned his friend lost his job and defaulted \non the loan. Applicant has not communicated with his friend and stated he learned a \nvaluable lesson and will not take this kind of risk again to help a friend.

(GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at \n3; Tr. 43-44, 50) This debt is being resolved. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the case establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began during the COVID-19 pandemic. He fell \nbehind on paying bills when numerous factories and plants closed down, drastically \nreducing his work as a truck driver whose income was based upon the volume and \nnumber of deliveries made to factories and plants. Using the profit from the sale of his \nhome, he took action to pay off his delinquent debts. He paid off four of the five delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. He also made a lump-sum payment of $1,000 towards the payoff of \nhis fifth debt, and credibly testified concerning his commitment to paying off the debt \ncompletely. He also relinquished his independent apartment to save money by renting \nfrom his sister. He has not taken on any significant new debts despite owning a car as a \ndaily driver that is over 20 years old. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect; however, perfection is not required. The \nsecurity clearance adjudication process is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt collection procedure. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nOverall, Applicant has demonstrated he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation does not cast doubt on his judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Under the facts of \nthis case, he has mitigated the security concerns regarding his finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/26/2024 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts several years ago due to the failure of her \nhusband\u2019s trucking business during the COVID pandemic. Once their finances stabilized, \nshe established a responsible track record of repaying her creditors. All but two of the \nSOR debts are resolved and the remaining debts will be paid soon. She provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 14, 2021, \nin connection with her employment in the defense industry. On February 15, 2023, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(CAS) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. The CAS issued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 3, 2023. She initially elected to have her \ncase decided by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, instead of a hearing. In an email to DOHA \npersonnel on April 18, 2023, she changed her mind and requested a hearing. The case \nwas assigned to me on October 31, 2023. On November 15, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling a video-teleconference hearing for December 11, 2023. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered documents that \nI marked as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant testified and submitted \ndocuments that I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. At the end of the hearing, I held the record open until \nDecember 20, 2023, to provide Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record. \nOn December 14, 2023, Applicant submitted an updated chart regarding the status \nof her SOR debts (AE I) and multiple new exhibits in support (AE J \u2013 AE T). All are cited \nin the Facts section, below. All her post-hearing exhibits were admitted without objection. \nThe record closed on December 18, 2023, when she said she had no further documents \nto submit. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted each debt alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u00ad\n1.k). She also provided a chart detailing the status of each debt alleged, and a narrative \nexplanation. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 44 years old. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has been employed \nin the defense industry since at least 2001, with a clearance. She has worked for her \ncurrent employer since 2012. She is currently a technical writer. Applicant and her future \nhusband met in 2011, and were in a long-term relationship together until they married in \nMarch 2021. They have no children together. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 18-19. 81-82) \nWith Applicant\u2019s help, her husband, then her boyfriend, started a trucking business \nin 2014. In about 2016 or 2017, his trucks needed costly maintenance and repairs. They \ntook out loans in both their names to help the business. The COVID pandemic crippled \nhis company in early 2020, and their financial problems worsened from there. She trusted \nhim to handle the finances of the business. All the SOR debts relate to this circumstance, \nas Applicant testified throughout the hearing that she took out credit accounts to get him \nset up in the business. She had no prior financial problems. After his business failed, he \ngot a stable, well-paying job in auto sales in December 2020, and they began addressing \ntheir debts. She owns their home, and they recently refinanced the mortgage, using some \nof the equity to address their debts. (Tr. 18-19, 81-82) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant learned a hard lesson about tying her credit to someone else, particularly \nbefore marriage. After receiving the SOR, Applicant talked to her security officer and \nlearned that she remained responsible for many of her delinquent debts, like charge offs \nor debts in collection. (Tr. 18-19, 38-45, 80-81). \nApplicant disclosed several debts on her December 2021 SCA and discussed \nthem in her April 2022 background interview. They are established by credit reports from \nNovember 2021, January 2022, August 2022, and March 2023. (GE 2 \u2013 GE 6) The \nGovernment also added a December 2023 credit report before the hearing. (GE 7) The \ndebts in the SOR total about $107,500. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($9,229) is the amount owed to Bank S from a judgment entered against \nApplicant in 2021. The debt concerns a past-due consumer credit card that H used for \ngas. The debt was resolved as of May 2023, through the equity in her home when they \nrefinanced. (Tr. 52-55, 68-69; AE G AE I, AE J) This is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.h \n($6,270), an account placed for collection by a bank. (Tr. 77-78) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($13,264) is the amount owed to a credit union on a judgment entered \nagainst Applicant in 2019. The amount, $14,901 with fees and costs, was paid in full in \nMay 2023. The debt concerned one of her husband\u2019s trailers from the trucking business. \n(Tr. 55-57; AE I, AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,827) is the amount owed to Bank C on a judgment entered against \nApplicant in 2019. During her testimony, she was unsure what this debt concerned. \nHowever, she later provided a letter from Bank C\u2019s successor, Bank G, reflecting that she \nhad a checking account there that was charged off in September 2019, with a balance \ndue of about $416. The account was paid in full in March 2020. (Tr, 57; AE I, AE L) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($36,749) is a charged-off auto debt. (GE 7) This debt concerns \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s truck that he used to haul the trailer for his business. The amount \nis the charged-off remainder after the vehicle was sold at auction. Applicant put her name \non the vehicle so he could buy it, in about 2014 or 2015. They fell behind on payments \nduring the COVID pandemic. In 2023, they negotiated a settlement of $20,000, with \n$2,000 monthly payments beginning in April or May 2023. As of December 2023, $12,000 \nhad been paid and $8,000 remained. (Tr. 58-61, 73; AE A, AE, AE M) This debt is being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($21,939) is a charged-off auto debt. This is another of Applicant\u2019s \nhusband\u2019s trucks. The amount is the charged-off remainder after the vehicle was sold at \nauction. In April 2023, the creditor initially offered to settle the debt for $15,000, in six \ninstallments. (AE A) By December 2023, the balance had been reduced to just under \n$19,000. The creditor offered a new settlement, for $8,500, with one payment of $1,416 \ndue in December 2023, and six payments of $1,181, with final payment due in early June \n2024. (AE I, AE N; Tr. 61-63, 74-76) This debt is being resolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($6,854) is a bank credit card with a hardware store, an account placed \nfor collection. The account, another one Applicant set up for her husband, was paid in full \nas of May 2023. (AE G, AE I, AE O; Tr. 63-67) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($5,709) is an account placed for collection by Bank C. This account is \nanother that Applicant set up for her husband\u2019s business. She provided a satisfaction of \njudgment showing that this account has been paid. (AE I, AE P; Tr. 67-68) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,355) is an account placed for collection by Bank S. This account is \nanother that Applicant set up for her husband\u2019s business. She made payments totaling \n$7,183 to resolve this account, and it was satisfied in August 2023. (Tr. 68-69, 78; AE F, \nAE I, AE Q) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($1.458) is a charged-off credit account that was used for Applicant\u2019s \nhusband to purchase tires for his business. In February 2023, the creditor offered to settle \nthe account for $875, which she promptly paid with a credit card. (Tr. 69; AE I, AE S) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($797) is a charged-off credit card from a tire company. As with other \ndebts, Applicant took out the account to help her husband with his business. The account \nwas settled and paid in August 2023. (Tr. 69-70; AE I, AE T) \nApplicant has an annual salary of $105,000, a 401(k) pension with about $65,000, \nand about $10,000 in savings. Since her husband changed careers in December 2020 to \nbecome an auto salesman, their finances have stabilized. She estimated that her \nhusband would earn about $250,000 in annual income by the end of 2023. She is now \nactively involved in the family finances and is the one who pays the bills. They have a \njoint bank account. She is also trying to pay down other household debts beyond the SOR \naccounts. She has no new credit cards or debts. She took a course at work through a \nnationally known and reputable credit counseling service that teaches clients the \n\u201csnowball\u201d way of paying debts (smallest debt first, one by one). They have no past-due \ntaxes or returns. Her plan is to continue to resolve the two debts that remain. (Tr. 19, 46-\n52, 66, 70-71, 81-87; GE 7) \nApplicant is highly experienced and highly rated at work, earning ratings of either \n\u201cOutstanding\u201d or \u201cExceeds Expectations\u201d across the board in recent performance \nevaluations. (AE B, AE C) Two supervisors of either 4 or 10 years of experience working \nwith Applicant, as well as her facility security officer (FSO) attested to her ability to get \nalong with others, her dependability, accountability, integrity, judgment, responsibility, \ntrustworthiness, and overall clearance worthiness. (AE D) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Applicant incurred numerous financial responsibilities starting in about 2014 \nwhen she helped her thenboyfriend, now her husband, start a trucking business. The \nbusiness failed during the COVID pandemic in 2020, and the accounts all became \ndelinquent. The disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and \n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) both apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll the delinquent debts in the SOR were accounts Applicant set up years ago, in \nhelping her thenboyfriend, now husband, start his trucking business. This included \nfinancing of multiple trucks, related tire and other accounts, as well as consumer credit \ncards. The business failed in 2020, the year the COVID pandemic started. Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to help her husband were well-intentioned, but she learned through experience the \nrisks that resulted when things later got out of hand. She testified credibly about the \nimpact this had on her, and I believe her when she says she will not make this mistake \nagain. Her husband soon took a new job as an auto salesman, has prospered, and now \nmakes about $250,000 annually, she estimated. They began using a reputable credit \ncounseling service and have steadily paid down their debts. She provided extensive \ndocumentation of her efforts. All but two of the accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) have been \npaid in full or have been settled and resolved. These last two debts are under a \nreasonable and responsible repayment plan and look to be resolved soon. They have \nincurred no new debts and their financial stability has steadily improved. Applicant also \nhas a long career as a cleared employee in the defense industry and is highly respected \nand highly trusted in her job. The above mitigating conditions fully apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I found Applicant to be a highly credible witness on her own behalf, and \nher well-documented case was supported by whole-person evidence from several work \nreferences. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern shown \nby her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to her continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 3.a-3.d. He did not admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 59-year-old information technology specialist employed by a defense contractor since May 2019. He has been employed by various federal contractors since August 2003. He was unemployed from March 2012 to April 2013 to care for a spouse with a complicated medical problem.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 1, 2021. On \nMarch 3, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G, J, and E. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses. He \ndid not submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until March 11, 2024, \nto enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A, B, and C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on March 11, 2024.  \nAmendment of SOR \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.f, which alleged \nthat a charge of driving while intoxicated was pending trial. The amendment deletes the \nwords, \u201cThe charge is still pending,\u201d and substitutes the words, \u201cYou were found guilty \nand sentenced to one year of probation.\u201d I granted the motion.

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 3.a-3.d. He did not admit or \ndeny SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f.

(GX 3 at 16) This incident occurred when he picked up his 17-year-old \nson and his son\u2019s friend at a movie theater and was driving home. (Tr. 32) He had \nconsumed wine with dinner and apparently consumed enough to be intoxicated. (Tr. 34) \nIn April 2009, Applicant was charged with felony DWI, third offense within five \nyears. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DWI, second offense within ten years. He was \nsentenced to 12 months in jail, with 11 months suspended, and placed on unsupervised \nprobation for five years. (GX 7; GX 8) He was required to install an interlock device on his \nvehicle for six months. (Tr. 37) This incident occurred after Applicant assisted a friend \nwhose car had a dead battery. After assisting his friend, they consumed tequila and a \nbeer. As Applicant was driving home, he was stopped by the police because his turn \nsignal was not working, and he had consumed enough alcohol to be intoxicated. (Tr. 34-\n35) He voluntarily sought and obtained counseling for three or four months, which he \nfound helpful. (Tr. 35-36) \nIn January 2021, Applicant was charged with DWI and refusal to take a \nbreathalyzer, a civil violation. The refusal was nolle prosequi. (GX 9) He was convicted of \nDWI and sentenced to 90 days in jail, suspended, and fined $750. (GX 10) Applicant \ntestified that he had not been drinking, but that he passed out while driving to his brother\u2019s \nhouse to pick up his mother and take her to dinner. He testified that he could not see, \ncould not speak, and was completely disoriented. He testified that he had a copy of the \npolice body camera recording that reflected a disagreement between the two police \nofficers. One officer declared, \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything,\u201d but the other says, \u201cHe\u2019s sauced.\u201d \nOn the advice of his attorney, he pleaded guilty to DWI. In March 2021, he went to a \nVeterans\u2019 Administration medical facility to determine what had happened, and he was \ndiagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic. (AX C) He believed that his incapacity during this incident \nwas due to diabetic retinopathy. After learning about his diagnosis, he decided to stop \ndrinking. (Tr. 40-43) \nIn January 2023, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor DWI, second offense \nwithin five years. In August 2023, he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail, \nwith four months and ten days suspended. He was fined $1,000, placed on unsupervised \nprobation for one year, and required to attend ASAP. (GX 13) His period of probation is \nscheduled to end in August 2024. This incident occurred when he tried to make a three-\npoint turnaround, using someone\u2019s driveway. He misjudged the distance and backed into \na ditch. It was raining, the ground was slippery, and he could not get out of the ditch. It \ntook about three hours for someone to help him. He had a bottle of alcohol in the vehicle \nthat he had intended to share with his sons to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. While waiting \nin his vehicle, he decided to drink some of the alcohol, and he consumed enough to be \nlegally intoxicated. When the police arrived at the scene, they charged him with DWI. At \nthe hearing, he testified that he has not consumed alcohol since this incident.

He worked for this employer for about eight and half years. He left the job after \na disagreement about a mission. A new resource manager sent him on a mission aboard \na Navy ship. While they were at sea, the commanding officer of the ship told him that they \ndid not ask for support and did not need it. He was sent back to shore, and he told a \ngovernment representative that the resource manager had sent him on an impossible \nmission. About two weeks later, Applicant\u2019s project manager told him that there was a \nrumor that he had identified the resource manager as \u201cthe single point of failure\u201d for the \nmission. The record does not reflect the source of the rumor. Appellant\u2019s project manager \ntold him that he had given the resource manager a \u201cblack eye\u201d by blaming him for the \nfailure, but that he could keep his job if he apologized to the resource manager. Applicant \nrefused to apologize, and he quit the job. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified SCAs submitted in April 2014, August \n2017, and July 2021. He denied the allegations in his answer to the SOR. \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in April 2014, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to the \nquestion asking if, in the last seven years, he quit after being told he would be fired. He \nstated that he was \u201cfalsely accused of making a statement concerning a government \nemployee, which was not true.\u201d He disclosed that he was unemployed from March 2012 \nto April 2013 because his then spouse had been diagnosed with a disease that was not \nproperly diagnosed for several months, and that he left the job to care for her and finish \nhis college degree. (GX 12 at 14, 16) In response to questions about his police record, \nhe disclosed that he was arrested for DUI in February 2009. (GX 12 at 27, 28) His answers \nin this SCA are alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b. \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in August 2017, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion in Section 13A (Employment Activities) asking if, during the last seven years, he \nhad been fired or quit after being told he would be fired. (GX 2 at 18-19) In Section 13C \n(Employment Record), he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the same question but disclosed that he left \nhis job after \u201cbeing accused of making a statement about a government employee, which \nwasn\u2019t true.\u201d (GX 2 at 22) He also disclosed that he had been unemployed from March \n2012 to April 2013 because his then spouse had been diagnosed with a disease that was \nnot properly diagnosed for several months, and that he left the job to care for her and \nfinish his college degree. (GX 2 at 20) He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question asking if he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. However, in the comments \nsection, he stated that he was arrested for DUI in February 2009. (GX 2 at 32). His \nanswers in this SCA are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in November 2018, he \nwas questioned about his record of alcohol-related incidents in 1987, 1988, 1999, 2008, \nand 2009.

However, when he was \ninterviewed in November 2021, he disclosed the 2009 DWI and told the investigator that \nhe had three to four DUIs and had talked about them in previous investigations. The \ninvestigator did not question him further about the earlier alcohol-related offenses. (GX 3 \nat 38) His answers in this SCA are alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA \nhearings and precludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal \nacts for which they were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, \n1997). In short, an Applicant is not permitted to relitigate a criminal trial that resulted in a \nconviction. \nThere are exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor \nconvictions based on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral estoppel \nto misdemeanor convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full and fair \nopportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for \ncollateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the applicant in the \ncriminal trial. Third, the application of collateral estoppel must not result in \u201cunfairness,\u201d \nsuch as where the circumstances indicate lack of incentive to litigate the issues in the \noriginal trial. None of these exceptions apply to Applicant\u2019s conviction of DWI in January \n2021. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse is recent, frequent, and \nhas not happened under unusual circumstances making it unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive \nalcohol use, but except for the short period of counseling after the April 2009 incident, he \nhas not sought or received counseling. He has been required to attend ASAP courses, \nbut those courses provide education, not treatment. He declared his intent to stop drinking \nafter each of the alcohol-related incidents, but he has not adhered to his intentions. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the alcohol-related conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal \nconduct is recent and did not occur under unusual circumstances. He is still on probation, \nand he submitted no evidence reflecting successful rehabilitation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question in his 2017 \nSCA, asking if in the last seven years, he quit a job after being told he would be fired or \nleft a job by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. This \nallegation is not established. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and explained that he \nquit his job after he was falsely accused of making a derogatory statement about a \ngovernment employee.

(GX 12 at 27-29) \n8 \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that he falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d in his 2017 SCA, asking if he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. This allegation is \nestablished. His SCA reflects that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, but in the preceding \nquestions about his police record, he disclosed February 2009 DUI arrest, alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. However, he did not disclose his arrests for DUI and DWI in 1987 and 1999, alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.

(GX 1 at 34-36) \nHowever, he did not disclose his earlier alcohol-related incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.d. When he was questioned by a security investigator in November 2021, he admitted \nall his previous alcohol-related arrests and convictions and told the investigator that he \nhad talked about them in previous background investigations. (GX 3 at 38) \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence to determine an applicant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining \nwhether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was \ndeliberate.

Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin November 2018, he admitted the two previous arrests but explained that he did not list \nthem in the 2017 SCA because he had disclosed them during a previous investigation. \n(GX 3 at 15.) \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThis allegation is established by the evidence supporting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d. I am \nsatisfied that Applicant intentionally omitted information in later SCAs that he had \npreviously disclosed. His omissions appear to have been caused, at least in part, by his \nreluctance to repeat his entire record in each iteration of the SCA. Nevertheless, he knew, \nbased on his experience, that his SCAs would be closely scrutinized and that he probably \nwould be questioned about them, especially after the first iteration. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established.

Applicant\u2019s omissions from his SCAs were recent, \nfrequent, and did not occur under unique circumstances. Falsification of an SCA is not \nminor. It \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). At the hearing, \nApplicant was sometimes resentful and argumentative, but he was sincere, candid, and \ncredible. I have considered his long record of public service, both in and out of uniform. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, J, and E, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas refuted some of the allegations under Guideline E, but he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(AE B) Terms of payment have not been set and are not expected \nto be set before the Fall of 2024. (AEs B-C; Tr. 41, 56) In the interim, Applicant has \nmade no student loan payments while he continues to wait for his lender to set income-\nbased monthly amounts of payment on the loans.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These AGs include conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                            \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

These \ndebt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of \nthe financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is \nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance \nthat entitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

He has avoided any breaks in employment since 2017 and has been \nfinancially positioned to address his debts. What has prevented him from paying on his \nstudent loans before they were paused in 2024 and addressing most of his consumer \ncreditors is unclear. \nAvailable mitigating conditions (MCs) under Guideline F are limited to \u00b6 20(b), \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency \na death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Because \nApplicant has not documented any actions taken to date to resolve his SOR-listed \nstudent loans and other debts through payments and payment plans before his student \nloans were paused, he cannot satisfy the \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d \nprong of \u00b6 20(b). \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old. He was born in the United States and his family immigrated to another country when he was an infant. In 1977, they immigrated to Canada, and he became a dual citizen. In 1984, he returned to the United States and enlisted in the U.S. military. He was honorably discharged in 1996 in the paygrade E-5. He married in 1991 and divorced in 1998. He has a grown child from the marriage. He remarried in 1998, divorced in 2002, and remarried in 2018. He has no other children. While in the military and for a period of time after his discharge, he held a security clearance, but it is no longer active. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a prospective employer.

(Tr. 9-11) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the original and amended SOR. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He was born in the United States and his family \nimmigrated to another country when he was an infant. In 1977, they immigrated to \nCanada, and he became a dual citizen. In 1984, he returned to the United States and \nenlisted in the U.S. military. He was honorably discharged in 1996 in the paygrade E-5. \nHe married in 1991 and divorced in 1998. He has a grown child from the marriage. He \nremarried in 1998, divorced in 2002, and remarried in 2018. He has no other children. \nWhile in the military and for a period of time after his discharge, he held a security \nclearance, but it is no longer active. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a \nprospective employer. (Tr. 27, 34-36, 91-93; GE 1) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s discharge from the military in 1996, he worked for company CA \nas a field technician. He was required to travel to other countries as part of his job. He \nsaid his job was to bring test equipment and fix problems. There were U.S. State \nDepartment travel advisories for some of the countries due to dangers and other risks. \nHe said he was also required to sell CA\u2019s equipment to their clients in these countries. He \nwould often receive cash for the sale. He was unaware that his actions may have been \ncircumventing export, customs, and tax laws. He would receive large sums of cash, \nsometimes as much as $30,000. He said he did not bring over $10,000 in cash into the \nUnited States. He would travel from wherever he was and go to the company\u2019s Paris \noffice and deposit the cash there.

At some point CA was not happy with his \nperformance and in September 1999 he was terminated for poor performance. He said \nduring his exit interview that he had certain equipment at his house, such as a pager and \ncell phone that he was to return. (Tr. 55-58) \nIn November 1999, Applicant returned to the CA office to retrieve his last \npaycheck. He was confronted by police and was asked if he knew who Mr. N was. He \ndenied he knew the person. He was asked if he had ever done any business with Mr. N. \nHe denied he did business with him. The Government\u2019s evidence includes emails \nbetween Applicant and Mr. N. showing that in May 1999, Applicant sold a piece of CA\u2019s \nequipment (spectrum analyzer) on eBay to Mr. N through a rent-to-own agreement. \nApplicant was still employed by CA when he sold the equipment. Mr. N sent three checks \nmade out to Applicant, totaling $800. Each check was deposited in Applicant\u2019s bank \naccount. Applicant told Mr. N that he purchased the equipment from CA before he was \nterminated. At some point, Mr. N noticed that there was a sticker on the equipment that \nidentified it as the property of CA. Mr. N contacted CA and it was determined that the \nproperty was stolen. The equipment was estimated to be worth about $20,000. \nApplicant\u2019s car was searched by police, and other equipment was found in his trunk that \nbelonged to CA. His home was also searched, and two other items of equipment owned \nby CA were found. Two spectrum analyzers and a frequency counter were found in \nApplicant\u2019s possession. (Tr.58-59, 115-118; GE 10) \nAt his hearing, Applicant could not recall or remember important aspects of the \nincident and investigation. He testified that he was unaware of the value of the equipment \nhe sold to Mr. N. When questioned further, he admitted it may have been worth between \n$5,000 and $15,000. Although he denied to the police that he knew who Mr. N was, at his \nhearing, he admitted he had made contact with him, but said he was selling the equipment \non eBay at the request of CA. He said it was CA that wanted him to sell the equipment \non eBay, and he did not believe he was doing anything wrong. His testimony was not \ncredible. (Tr. 59, 62, 119-122, 135-136) \nApplicant was on probation in November 1999 for a driving under the influence \n(DUI) of alcohol offense when he was arrested and charged with grand theft-\nembezzlement, a felony, for the property he stole from CA. He said either his wife at the \ntime or her family posted his bond. He could not recall. He thought the bond was about \n$20,000. He was released on his own recognizance. He first testified that he was aware \nhe was required to appear for every court date. He then said he was not sure he \nunderstood the requirements of the bail and bond. He was uncertain if one of the terms \nwas that he was not to leave the country. He said he figured he could reschedule his court \ndates by just asking his lawyer to do it for him. He said his intent was not to run away to \nCanada. He did not have a job and found one in Canada. About a month or two after he \nwas released on bail he moved to Canada. He was still on probation for his DUI when he \nwent to Canada. He could not recall if he had his probation officer\u2019s permission to move \nto Canada. He did not notify his probation officer he was leaving the country. He could \nnot recall if he was to notify the court of a change of address. He did not obtain permission \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor notify the court he was moving out of the country. I did not find Applicant credible. (Tr. \n62-66, 119-1122 \nApplicant was supposed to start his new job in Canada on the same day he was \nrequired to be in court in the United States. He testified that he was practically homeless \nat that time and needed the job. He said he tried to call his attorney to tell him he was \ntaking a job in Canada and said, \u201che did not pick up the phone for whatever reason.\u201d He \nleft the country. His attorney reached out to him and asked where he was when he failed \nto appear in court on the scheduled date. He stated in his SOR answer that he did not \nrealize that his court appearance for a felony charge was mandatory. He forfeited the \nbond. He missed his court date and in 2002 was charged in federal court with unlawful \nflight to avoid prosecution. Applicant testified that he never intentionally tried to run from \nthe law but rather was trying to get home when he left the United States and went to \nCanada. I did not find his testimony credible. (Tr. 61, 63, 66-70, 78-79; Answer to the \nSOR; GE 3) \nApplicant then explained that he hired a Canadian attorney. He said the state \nwhere he was criminally charged would not negotiate with him for his return. He wanted \nthe state to withdraw the unlawful flight charge and failure to appear charge and then he \nwould voluntarily return. He explained that the state knew where he was located. He was \nconcerned that the additional charges of failure to appear and unlawful flight could \npotentially add three years of prison if he was convicted. He claimed he knew he could \nbeat the grand theft-embezzlement charge, but he was concerned with the other charges. \nHe said the only way to fight the charges was to force the United States to extradite him. \nHe fought extradition, which is why it took six years. In October 2006, he was extradited \nto the United States from Canada. He testified that U.S. Marshals were required to travel \nto Canada and escort him to the United States to address his criminal charges. In 2009, \nhe pleaded guilty to the felony grand theft-embezzlement charge and was found guilty. It \nappears the other charges were dropped. He received a 90-day sentence and all but a \ncouple days were suspended. (Tr. 70-76,79, 80, 122-129) \nIn 2016, Applicant petitioned the court for his felony grand theft-embezzlement \nconviction to be expunged. Under the state\u2019s law, the charge was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor and then the finding of guilty was changed to a not guilty finding, dismissed, \nand expunged. Unlike other states the expungement is still a matter of record and can be \nretrieved. This practice appears to be unique to this state. (Tr. 24, 79-80, 127; GE 4; AE \nC) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2022. \nSection 22 asked him to disclose any offense not previous disclosed and if he had ever \nbeen charged with a felony and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol or drugs. He responded \u201cno.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant did not disclose his 1999 DUI offense, the felony grand theft-\nembezzlement charge, fleeing from prosecution, and failure to appear charge.

He said he assumed the question asked if these offenses had \noccurred within the last seven years and the word \u201cEVER\u201d was a complete oversight. \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2022. He was asked \nwhy he failed to disclose his felony grand theft-embezzlement charge and his DUI. He \nsaid he thought he was only required to disclose the charges for the past seven years. \nHe then explained the circumstances around his 1998 DUI. (GE 1, 2, 9) \nWhen questioned at his hearing, Applicant explained his failure to disclose his past \nfelony and DUI was a typographical error, and he selected the wrong answer for this part \nof the SCA. It was also learned through Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was charged and \nconvicted for DUI in 1988 in another state. He did not disclose this offense on his SCA. \nHe also did not disclose to the investigator during his March 2022 interview his 1988 DUI. \nHe admitted he was charged, found guilty and received two days in jail. He said he \nchecked his FBI report on his criminal activity and the 1988 DUI was not reported, so he \ndid not disclose it. This offense was not alleged in the SOR or his failure to disclose it on \nhis SCA. I did not find Applicant credible. I find he deliberately failed to disclose the \nrequired information as alleged in the SOR on his SCA. (Tr. 80-82, 84-87; GE 1) \nApplicant was also asked in his February 2022 SCA if in the past seven years he \nhad failed to timely file or pay his federal, state, or other taxes as required by law. He \nresponded \u201cno.\u201d He commented: \u201cI have filed within the past seven years but due to \n[C]ovid I was unable to file a couple of years.\u201d In June 2022, he was contacted by a \ngovernment investigator to clarify information about filing his tax returns. He admitted he \nhad not filed federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2019, 2020, and 2021. He \nexplained that he expected to get a refund and he did not file because he did not have an \naccountant to assist him, and the accountant he used in the past was elderly, and he was \ndeterred in using him because of COVID and health reasons. He explained to the \ninvestigator that he answered \u201cno\u201d on his SCA by mistake. He also explained that he did \nnot know the amount of taxes he might owe as they had not been completed at that time. \nHe attempted to complete them himself but was unsuccessful and he was consumed with \ncompleting his wife\u2019s immigration paperwork. He planned to have the delinquent returns \nfiled by July 2022. \nApplicant was questioned at his hearing about his failure to timely file his 2018, \n2019, 2020, and 2021 tax returns. He explained he did not believe he had to file tax \nreturns because of his low income. He admitted when he was in the military he did not \nearn much money and had to file his income tax returns. He then said he had many things \nhappening. He was hit by a postal truck, his parents\u2019 health was failing, he was \nexperiencing stress due to his wife\u2019s immigration status, and his wife had cancer and he \nwas worried about a relapse. When questioned further, he stated his wife had been \ndiagnosed in 2015 and he continued to be worried. He admitted these were all stressors, \nbut they did not prohibit him from filing his tax returns on time. He stated his failure to \ntimely file was not intentional.

He had no excuse for failing to file. He said that \nhe hired a tax preparer in 2017 to do his 2018 tax returns, but they did not get completed \nbecause of the other stressors going on in his life.

State documents show that \nApplicant filed his 2018 through 2021 state tax returns in January 2023. For tax year 2019, \nhe listed his adjusted gross income as $1 on his federal income tax return. He admitted \nat his hearing that this was not true information when he filed his tax return. He testified \nthat all of his income taxes are paid. A review of Applicant\u2019s tax transcripts shows that \ntaxes owed for certain tax years were paid by his withholdings and the balance was paid \nby the pandemic tax credits that were applied to the remaining balances. He does not \nhave any outstanding balances on his federal taxes. He said he will never be late filing \nagain. (Tr. 40, 46-49, 101-107; GE 2; AE D) \nA review of Applicant state income tax transcripts shows he filed his 2022 return \ntimely. He filed his 2021 state tax return in January 2023 and paid the amount owed when \nhe filed the return. His 2020 tax return was filed in January 2023, and he paid the tax \nwhen he filed the return. He filed tax year 2019 state income tax return in January 2023, \nand he owed $280, which was not paid at that time. He filed his 2018 state income tax \nreturn in January 2023, and he owed $594, which was not paid at that time. Applicant \nprovided another document from his state that reflects he has zero balances owed for tax \nyears 2019 through 2022. It does not reflect information for tax year 2018. (Tr. 101-107; \nAE D) \nApplicant was asked at his hearing if he owed any other federal or state taxes. He \nstated he was unaware that he owed any. Documents support that there are two \noutstanding tax liens from a state where he had lived. A lien filed in 2000 is for $3,000 \nand another filed in 2002 is for $11,000. Applicant said these liens never came up when \nhe retrieved his credit report, and he would take care of them. (Tr. 107-108; GE 8) \nApplicant received government interrogatories in November 2022. In them, he \ndisclosed numerous delinquent debts that he had not paid and were not part of payment \nagreements. He disclosed in the interrogatories that he had paid his 2018 federal income \ntaxes. He signed the interrogatories on December 16, 2022. \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2023. He explained that he knew \nto obtain a security clearance he would need to show he was resolving his delinquent \ndebts to show he was trustworthy and responsible. He wanted to show he was taking his \nfinances seriously and filing for bankruptcy was the fastest way to show that. He disclosed \non his bankruptcy documents that he has approximately $19,600 of unsecured debts. He \npays $640 a month for his Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

He attributed his problems to stressors in \nhis life and his parents\u2019 declining health issues. The pandemic impacted his ability to find \nemployment.

(AE A, B). \nI have not considered any derogatory information for disqualifying purposes. \nHowever, I may consider it when applying the mitigating conditions, in making a credibility \ndetermination and in my whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(d) deceptive or illegal fraudulent practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \nand \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired.  \nThere is substantial evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2018 to 2021. He eventually filed them when the security clearance review process \nstarted. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nIn November 1999, law enforcement found in Applicant\u2019s possession two spectrum \nanalyzers and a frequency counter, all of which belonged to an employer who had \nterminated him in September 1999. The properly was worth thousands of dollars. Prior to \nhis termination, he sold a spectrum analyzer that had been converted from his employer\u2019s \npossession for approximately $20,000 on eBay. AG \u00b6 19(d) applies. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2023 because he had \nnumerous delinquent debts, wanted to obtain a security clearance, and became aware \nhis finances may hinder him. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2023 and has made monthly \npayments of $640. He testified his motivation for resolving his debts was because he was \napplying for a security clearance and was aware that his finances could be a potential \nissue. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a legal means of addressing one\u2019s burdensome debts. I \nhave considered that Applicant is in compliance with his payment plan under Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. The fact that Applicant has a payment agreement and has made payments \n\u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd. Oct. 30, 2014). AG \u00b6 20(d) has some application. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2018 through 2021 federal and state tax returns. \nIn January 2023, he filed them. His motivation for filing was to obtain a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns are recent, numerous, and did not occur under circumstances making \nrecurrence unlikely. He failed to timely file his tax returns for multiple tax years and then \neventually did so after the security clearance process began, which demonstrates that he \ndid not act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(g) is established because Applicant\u2019s past-due tax \nreturns have been filed. \nI did not find Applicant credible during his testimony. His motivation for making \nfinancial arrangements through bankruptcy and the eventual filing of his federal and state \ntax returns was not because it was the right thing to do and it was his legal obligation but \nwas because his negative financial record would impact his ability to obtain a security \nclearance. He said his parents were in poor health and he had employment issues. These \nwere beyond his control. He failed to show how he acted responsibly when his debts were \ndue, after he regained employment, and why he delayed for years to file his tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent taxes and debts until after realizing \nthat they were an impediment to obtaining a security clearance \u201cdoes not reflect the \nvoluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the \nnation\u2019s secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016.) \nApplicant converted property worth about $20,000 that belonged to a former \nemployer at a company where he had worked and been terminated from employment. He \nsold the property on eBay. He was charged with a felony and pleaded guilty. Applicant \nboldly misused his position as an employee when he took equipment from his former \nemployer and later sold it. His hearing testimony and denials were unbelievable. He \ncannot be trusted and has a history to prove it. There is scant evidence of other mitigation. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. \nBd. Jun. 21, 2010). This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might \nknowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). Although, there is some mitigation, it is \ninsufficient to find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn November 1999, Applicant was on probation for driving under the influence of \nalcohol, when he was arrested and charged with grand theft-embezzlement, a felony, in \nstate court. He was accused of stealing property from a former employer and selling it on \neBay as noted above. It was worth about $20,000. He had in his possession two spectrum \nanalyzers and a frequency counter taken from his former employer worth about $20,000. \nHe failed to appear while on bail in connection to the charges above. He was charged in \nfederal court with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and failure to appear. He left the \ncountry and went to Canada where he is a dual citizen. He did not voluntarily return to the \nUnited States, but instead in about October 2006, he was extradited to the United States \nfrom Canada. He pled guilty to the charge of grand theft-embezzlement. He was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail. The charge was eventually expunged under state law.

The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was convicted of grand theft-embezzlement in state court. I have \nconsidered it was eventually expunged. Despite being aware when he was released on \nbail with a $20,000 bond that he was required to appear in court, he decided to leave the \ncountry. I did not find Applicant\u2019s explanation believable that he had no other alternative. \nHe did not return to the United States voluntarily. Instead, he blamed the state for not \nbeing willing to negotiate with him. It took years to extradite him, and he forced the United \nStates to send U.S. Marshals to Canada to escort him back. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious. He failed to take responsibility for his \nconduct. He blamed his employer from whom he stole high-price equipment. He provided \nlittle explanation for why he was selling it on eBay other than to say his employer asked \nhim to. When he left the country, he blamed his attorney and then the state because it \nrefused to negotiate with him to reduce or withdraw charges. He forced the United States \nto extradite him instead of returning voluntarily. The predicament he found himself in, \nbeing charged with flight, was one he created and then attempted to use to negotiate his \nreturn. The offense of grand theft-embezzlement is a crime of moral turpitude because \nApplicant was placed in a position of trust, and he violated the trust of his employer. \nAlthough, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred years ago, he has not taken full \nresponsibility for it and there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. His \ntestimony was repeatedly not believable. I cannot find that future criminal conduct is \nunlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his trustworthiness, reliability, and \ngood judgment. I find the above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which , when combined with all available information , \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose on his February 2022 SCA his DUI and \ngrand theft-embezzlement, and failure to appear charges as was required. I did not find \nhis explanations credible regarding these matters. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy and failure to file both federal and state income tax returns \nfor multiple years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) as alleged under Guideline F, and his criminal \nconduct as alleged under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), were cross-alleged under \nthe personal conduct guideline. The adverse conduct in these allegations is adequately \ncovered under both Guidelines F and J. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his felony charges for grand theft-\nembezzlement, failure to appear, and his alcohol-related charge of DUI are not minor \noffenses. His multitude of explanations to the government investigator and at his hearing \nonly exacerbated the concern. The security clearance process relies on those seeking a \nclearance to be honest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and numerous awards and certificates and \nperformance appraisals. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns from 2018 to 2021. Motivated by the security clearance process he filed them in \nJanuary 2023. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His father, who \nwas born in Egypt, came to the United States many years ago to pursue a graduate \neducation and became a U.S. citizen. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant has U.S. citizenship, \nderived from being born overseas of a naturalized U.S citizen (his father). Applicant also \nholds Egyptian citizenship through his father. Applicant has an Egyptian passport, but it \nexpired several years ago and he does not intend to renew it. Applicant\u2019s mother was \nborn in Egypt of a Saudi father and an Egyptian mother. She is a citizen of Saudi Arabia \nand has never held Egyptian citizenship. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant has a brother and a \nsister who are citizens and residents of the United States. (GE 1; 29-41, 51-57, 88-89) \nApplicant spent the first three years of his life living in the United States. His \nparents moved the family to Saudi Arabia in about 2003, after the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, led them to feel persecuted in the United States as Muslims. He \nspent the rest of his childhood in Saudi Arabia and graduated from an international high \nschool in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 26, 29-30, 36, 43-44, 57) \nWhen he turned 18, Applicant decided \u201cto come to my country, the United States\u201d \nfor college. (Tr. 24) He briefly pursued pilot training in 2016, but then changed schools. \nHe earned an associate degree in 2018 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics in \nDecember 2020. He later pursued a master\u2019s degree but is no longer in school. He \nworked for an economics firm as an intern from November 2018 until May 2020, when \nhe lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was then unemployed until June \n2021. Since July 2021, he has worked full time as an analyst or consultant on \ngovernment contracts for a large consulting firm. He earns $90,000 annually and has \nabout $20,000 in his 401(k)-pension plan. He seeks a security clearance through his \nemployment and has not had one before. Between 2016 and Mach 2023, he lived in \nState 1. (GE 1; AE D; Tr. 8, 26-27, 44-47, 69-71) \nApplicant\u2019s parents remain in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 35, 53, 56) In recent years he \nhas visited them regularly in Egypt and in Saudi Arabia. (GE 2) Since his September \n2022 background interview, Applicant has visited them in Egypt twice a year, most \nrecently in May 2023, and again from December 2023 to January 2024. (Tr. 38, 43, 53-\n54, 57, 79-81)  \nApplicant speaks to his parents daily or every other day.

(AE A, AE B, AE C) \nAdministrative Notice \nEgypt (Taken from Government\u2019s AN II and AE H):  \nEgypt is a republic governed by an elected president and bicameral legislature. \nInspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led \ndemonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni Mubarak's \nouster in 2011. In January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and \nin May 2014 elected former defense minister Abdelfattah El Sisi president. El Sisi was \nreelected to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via \nnational referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending El Sisi's term in office \nthrough 2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. (AN II) \nHistorically, Egypt has been an important country for U.S. national security \ninterests based on its geography, demography, and diplomatic posture. Egypt controls \nthe Suez Canal, which opened in 1869 and is one of the world\u2019s most critical maritime \nchokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. As of 2023, an estimated 12% of \nglobal trade, including 7% of the world\u2019s oil, ships through the Suez Canal. Egypt\u2019s \npopulation of more than 104 million people makes it by far the most populous Arabic-\nspeaking country. Egypt\u2019s 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most \nsignificant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While \npeople-to-people relations remain limited, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have \nincreased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai \nPeninsula and Gaza Strip.

(AE H) \nThe U.S. Department of State advises individuals to reconsider travel to Egypt \ndue to terrorism. The Department of State also advises individuals to exercise increased \ncaution in Egypt due to the Embassy\u2019s limited ability to assist dual national U.S.-\nEgyptian citizens who are arrested or detained. Terrorist groups continue plotting \nattacks in Egypt. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted \ndiplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, \nwestern businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists \nhave conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security \npresence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites, to include mosques, churches, \nmonasteries, and buses traveling to these locations. The State Department has also \ncatalogued and taken notice of human rights issues in Egypt. (AE II) \nSaudi Arabia (Taken from Government\u2019s AN II and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I): \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King Salman bin Abdul \nAziz, who is both head of state and head of government. The 1992 Basic Law sets out \nthe system of governance, rights of citizens, and powers and duties of the government, \nand it provides that the Quran and Sunna (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) \nserve as the country\u2019s constitution. It specifies that the rulers of the country shall be \nmale descendants of the founder, King Abdulaziz (Ibn Saud) (AN II) \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wields global influence through its administration of \nthe birthplace of the Islamic faith and by virtue of its large oil reserves (17.2% of global \ntotal) and its role as a major oil exporter. Since acceding to the throne in 2015, King \nSalman bin Abdul Aziz (age 87) has empowered his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin \nSalman as heir apparent, prime minister, and the central figure in Saudi policymaking. \n(AE I) \nSaudi leaders\u2019 top priority at home appears to remain their Vision 2030 initiative, \nthrough which the kingdom is attempting to transform its economy, public finances, and \nsocial contract. Abroad, Saudi officials conduct a multidirectional foreign policy that \nembraces parallel partnerships with the United States and U.S. strategic competitors, \nsuch as Russia and China. Saudi policy toward the Middle East region currently \nappears to prioritize d\u00e9tente; in March 2023, the kingdom reestablished diplomatic \nrelations with Iran in an agreement facilitated in part by China. Lower regional tensions \nmay contribute to Saudi government efforts to market the kingdom as an attractive hub \nfor investment, commerce, and tourism\u2014all central to the Vision 2030 initiative. \nContinued Saudi cooperation with Russia on oil output decisions bolsters revenue for \nboth countries.

(AN II) \nDuring the Biden Administration, the U.S.-Saudi relationship at times has \nappeared strained, but public comments in 2022 and 2023 from both countries have \nhighlighted ongoing cooperation and new collaborative opportunities. During a June \n2023 visit to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted ongoing U.S.-Saudi \ncounterterrorism and regional security cooperation and promoted emergent U.S.-Saudi \ncollaboration on global infrastructure financing, digital communications technology \ndevelopment, and clean energy adoption initiatives.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence-collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nA heightened security risk is established by the administratively noticed facts \nabout Saudi Arabia and Egypt, especially human rights concerns, risks of terrorism, and \nongoing regional instability. Applicant unquestionably has strong and ongoing ties to \nboth Egypt and Saudi Arabia, through his wife and his parents. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \nboth apply to them. \nThe remaining allegations concern Applicant\u2019s \u201cclose and continuing contact with \nfriends who are citizens and residents\u201d of either Egypt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) or Saudi Arabia \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). While Applicant admitted each allegation without explanation, neither \nallegation describes any individual with any specificity. Further, none of these contacts \nsuggest a current foreign influence security concern. Applicant has maintained \nfriendships with some childhood schoolmates (from school in Saudi Arabia) and college \nfriends (from college in the United States), and he maintains social media and other \ncontact with other foreign citizens through a shared interest in online gaming. None of \nhis friends or contacts are foreign government or military employees, and his \nrelationships with them are largely casual. I do not find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) or 7(b) apply to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d or 1.e and find those allegations for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \nUnderstandably, Applicant maintains close and frequent, even daily, contact with \nhis parents in Saudi Arabia and his wife in Egypt. His new wife has never visited the \nUnited States, and indeed, is not allowed to do so until her visa is approved. She \nremains an Egyptian citizen (as does Applicant, through his father). If anything, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Egypt have strengthened since the issuance of the SOR, since he \nand his fianc\u00e9e are now married. The presence of Applicant\u2019s parents in Saudi Arabia is \nan additional security concern, given the heightened risk concerns about the Saudi \ngovernment and its treatment of its own citizens, and other reasons laid out in the \nadministrative notice materials. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family members, her parents and siblings, are not alleged as \nindependent security concerns but their presence in Egypt undercuts any mitigation \notherwise shown, as Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt are therefore increased even if he and his \nwife have a strained relationship with her family. \nApplicant regards the United States as his country, and he has ties here through \nhis citizenship, education, his professional career, and his siblings. As he \nacknowledged, establishing property ties (buying a home) is expensive, particularly at \nhis relatively young age, and he has yet to find a home for himself and his wife here. \nWhile this is understandable, these ties must be weighed against his strong connections \nto his family in Egypt and Saudi Arabia \u2013 ties that have now strengthened due to his \nrecent marriage. Based on the administrative notice materials, there is strong evidence \nthat Applicant may be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between \nU.S. and Egyptian or Saudi interests, and a heightened risk of the potential of \nexploitation, duress or coercion is shown. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) do not apply to \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. Applicant has not met his heavy burden \nof persuasion of establishing that the foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nrecommendations and strong professional evaluations. However, given the strong \nheightened risk of foreign coercion, exploitation, or duress, Applicant has not met his \nheavy burden of showing that the security concerns established by his family \nconnections to Egypt and Saudi Arabia through his wife and parents are mitigated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant has numerous unresolved delinquent debts. He failed to timely file his \n2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 federal income tax returns. He is indebted to the \nfederal government of unpaid federal income taxes. The guideline notes several \nconditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are established \nby the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant has not established that he has \nmade a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts or shown that he has acted in a \nreasonable and responsible manner in addressing these financial problems. He provides \ndocumentation of his actions that he claims in his security clearance interview or in his \nresponse to the Government interrogatories. To receive full credit under Mitigating \nCondition AG \u00b6 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d He has stated his intentions to act but has \nnot resolved any debts. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He \nhas not provided documentary evidence of payments or other action on the debts alleged \nin the SOR. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d Good faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acted in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. \n4, 2001). Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes from tax years 2016 and 2017 are unresolved. He \ncites various reasons for his delinquent taxes. He has not shown he has initiated a \npayment plan with the IRS. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.12-01664 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, \n2014). \nApplicant attributes his debts to an illness, periods of unemployment, and his \ndivorce. These events were beyond is control. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For \nfull consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. Even if Applicant\u2019s debts \noccurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant offered evidence he had recently filed his \ntax returns for the years in question. He declared his filing issues on his SCA citing his \n2013 divorce for not being able to file for tax years 2015 to 2019 and gave the same \nreason for tax year 2020. He did not support why his 2013 divorce resulted in his repeated \nfailure to fulfill his legal obligations in tax years 2015 through 2020. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n   \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017). Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. In 1989, he married and in 1995 he was divorced. He married again in 1996. His second wife works by managing their two rental properties. Applicant has three adult children and an adult stepson. Since March 2022, he has been employed as a database administrator for a DOD contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 19-20) Applicant stated that he has always had the responsibility for filing the household income tax returns with the use of computer tax software, but recently his wife became involved by organizing the rental expenses. In his Answer, he stated that his tax problems developed during his February 2019 to November 2021 employment with a company providing medical equipment, such as respirators, hospital beds, and oxygen, which became chaotic during the pandemic. His employer required him to work numerous hours and be on call 24 hours a day, to include while he was on vacation. The time requirements enforced by his employer left him little time to prepare and file his 2019, 2020 (and 2021) federal income tax returns, (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), as well as his state income tax returns for the same tax years.

On May 6, 2024, I notified all parties that I \nwould have to reschedule this hearing, and all parties agreed to reschedule the hearing \nfor May 13, 2024. The hearing proceeded as scheduled via online video-teleconferencing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which I admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted six exhibits, which I admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through F without objection. Upon Applicant\u2019s request, I kept \nthe record open until May 28, 2024, to provide him the opportunity to supplement the \nevidentiary record. He timely submitted three state income tax returns, which I admitted \nas AE G without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 20, 2024. \nThe record closed on May 28, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 years old. From 1989 to 1995, he served on active duty in the U.S. \nAir Force, from which he received an honorable discharge at the rank of E-4. He earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. In 1989, he married and in 1995 he was divorced. He married \nagain in 1996. His second wife works by managing their two rental properties. Applicant \nhas three adult children and an adult stepson. Since March 2022, he has been employed \nas a database administrator for a DOD contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 19-20) \nApplicant stated that he has always had the responsibility for filing the household \nincome tax returns with the use of computer tax software, but recently his wife became \ninvolved by organizing the rental expenses. In his Answer, he stated that his tax problems \ndeveloped during his February 2019 to November 2021 employment with a company \nproviding medical equipment, such as respirators, hospital beds, and oxygen, which \nbecame chaotic during the pandemic. His employer required him to work numerous hours \nand be on call 24 hours a day, to include while he was on vacation. The time requirements \nenforced by his employer left him little time to prepare and file his 2019, 2020 (and 2021) \nfederal income tax returns, (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), as well as his state income tax returns for the \nsame tax years. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) He said, \u201cconsidering the things that were going on in my \nlife from 2019 to '21, it just -- it wasn't -- it was a priority to pay, less of a priority to get it \nfiled, because I felt like I would get it done at any time.\u201d He left this employment in \nNovember 2021, and he remained unemployed until March 2022. Department Counsel \nasked Applicant why he did not use that time to file his 2019 and 2020 income tax returns, \nand he said that he most likely needed that time to recover from his demanding and \nstressful job. (Answer; Tr. 21, 28-30, 47-51; AE D) \nApplicant disclosed on his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), submitted in March 2022, that he had not yet filed his 2020 and 2021 federal \nincome tax returns. He listed that he planned to file these income tax returns by the April \n15, 2022 deadline.

His new employer required \nhim to become certified in cyber security, which was a difficult and time-consuming \nprocess, and time got away from him. He also did not think it was very important because \nhe believed he did not owe any taxes, which ultimately was a wrong assumption. (GE 1; \nTr. 30-32, 37-38) \nIn September 2022, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. When questioned about his unfiled 2020 and 2021 tax \nreturns, Applicant stated that he was delayed from filing these tax returns due to lost \nexpense records from his two rental properties. He told the investigator that he would \nhave these tax returns filed by November 2022. (GE 2; Answer) \nOn February 3, 2023, another DOHA Department Counsel contacted Applicant via \ne-mail to request he provide copies of his 2016-2021 federal tax transcripts. On February \n15, 2023, Applicant provided copies of his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcripts for \ntax years (TY) 2018-2021. His 2018 tax transcript was the only record that reflected he \nhad filed a tax return in October 2019. Applicant stated, \u201cI will complete all required actions \nby close of business Friday.\u201d He also reported that he thought he had filed his 2019 \nfederal income tax return more than a year earlier, but it looked like it was not properly \nprocessed through the tax software. (GE 3) \nApplicant provided updated IRS tax records. His 2019 federal tax return was \nreceived by the IRS on March 14, 2023, and processed on May 1, 2023. There is a zero-\nbalance reflected on this record. His 2020 federal income tax return was received by the \nIRS on February 27, 2023, and processed on April 3, 2023. He made payments totaling \n$2,905 and the account balance is zero. His 2021 federal income tax return was received \nby the IRS on March 22, 2023, and processed on May 22, 2023. After he made payments \ntotaling $5,923, his account balance is zero. The tax record for tax year 2022 showed that \nApplicant filed this return late, since it was received by the IRS on May 31, 2023, and was \nprocessed on June 26, 2023. The account balance is zero. He requested an extension \nfrom the IRS to file his 2023 income tax return in October 2024. Applicant admitted that \nhe was motivated to finally get the income tax returns filed by \u201cDOHA and his wife.\u201d The \nupcoming DOHA hearing was part of the reason he was inspired to file his tax returns, \nbut he also just wanted to get this problem resolved so that it was no longer weighing on \nhim. (AE C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-7; Tr. 32-35, 39) \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant provided documentation of his state tax return \nstatus, but he did not provide information when the 2019, 2020, and 2021 state income \ntax returns were actually filed. After the hearing, he submitted state tax documents that \nreflected that his 2019, 2020, and 2021 state income tax returns were all filed on February \n24, 2023. He was issued refunds for all three tax years. (AE G; Tr. 33-34, 40-41) \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant owes the IRS $8,234 in back taxes, \ninterest, and penalties for TY 2012.

He received \ntwo 1099s for the 2012 tax year, but when he filed the 2012 tax return, he only attached \none 1099. When he discovered that he owed back taxes, penalties and interest, he \nappeared before the U.S. Tax Court in 2016 to challenge it. The court ruled that Applicant \nhad a deficiency in income tax due for 2012 in the amount of $23,091. Applicant was \nunsatisfied with this ruling, and instead of making payments, he opted to have his tax \nrefunds be intercepted every year to satisfy this tax debt. He testified that after he \nchallenges the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s ruling for a second time in the near future, and if he is \nfound liable in the amount of $8,234, he will then make monthly payments of $500 until \nthe tax debt is satisfied.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following one is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleges and the Government established Applicant failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TY 2019, 2020, and 2021. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2019, \n2020, and 2021. He attributed his tax issues to his period of employment with a medical \nequipment provider during the COVID-19 pandemic and the numerous hours required by \nhis employer. He admitted that he was aware he was required to file annual federal and \nstate tax returns; however, he took no steps to file the unfiled returns for multiple years, \nor during the time he was unemployed for about four or five months following his departure \nfrom this employer in November 2021. He had promised in his March 2022 e-QIP that he \nwould file these tax returns by April 15, 2022. He then promised during his September \n2022 background interview that he would file his tax returns in November 2022. He failed \nto fulfill his promises on both occasions. It was not until a DOHA Department Counsel \nrequested his tax transcripts in February 2023 that finally motivated Applicant to file his \nincome tax returns between February and May 2023. The SOR was issued on February \n22, 2023. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. The timing of \nhis filings undermines the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement under consideration in this case. \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant filed his 2022 federal (and presumably \nstate) income tax returns untimely as well. Applicant currently owes $8,234 for TY 2012, \nand he testified at the hearing that he plans to challenge, in the near future and for a \nsecond time, the amount of 2012 income taxes that was determined he owed. Applicant \nhas had many years following his 2016 U.S. Tax Court ruling to challenge the decision, \nbut based on the facts, I find he clearly has a history of procrastination. Applicant\u2019s delay \nin addressing these delinquent taxes undercuts evidence that he has acted in a financially \nresponsible manner. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not \nbe considered for disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant claimed that he initially believed that he was not required to timely file \nhis tax returns if he expected a tax refund; however, he provided no plausible basis for \nhis belief that he was due a refund when the evidence showed he owed taxes for federal \nTYs 2020 and 2021. The March 2022 e-QIP put Applicant on notice that his unfiled tax \nreturns were a security concern, however he did not consult any tax preparers to assist \nhim with his filings.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, and his otherwise favorable financial \nhistory with his creditors. I also recognize that he was working in a stressful work \nenvironment during the pandemic, which impacted his ability to file his tax returns timely. \nBy the time he completed the e-QIP in March 2022, however, he was aware that his \nunfiled tax returns were a security concern and he failed to make them a priority. He did \nnot address his tax issues until February 2023, after a DOHA Department Counsel \nrequested copies of his tax transcripts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Unio Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 73, 183 D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, \n367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Notwithstanding his recent filings, he did \nnot establish that he acted responsibly to address his tax problems. For all these reasons, \nI conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2023, and the \nhearing was held as scheduled on December 12, 2023. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s \nexhibit list and pre-hearing discovery letter were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A1-A3 and B, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since April 2022. \nHe worked for an electronics company for about 21 years. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree, \nawarded in 1988. He is divorced (married 1997-2011) and has no children. This is his first \ntime seeking a security clearance. (Tr. 20; GE 1; Answer Exh. 1, 6) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana at various times from about October \n1980 to about December 2021; that he purchased marijuana from about October 1980 to \nabout September 2020; and that he used the prescription medication, OxyContin, not \nprescribed to him, at various times from about September 2018 to about September 2020. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol in excess, and to the point \nof intoxication, from 1980 to present; that he was arrested in November 2013 and charged \nwith driving under the influence (DUI); that he received treatment at an alcohol treatment \nfacility from June to July 2010, for a condition diagnosed as episodic alcohol abuse \ndisorder; and that he continues to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his treatment for \nepisodic alcohol abuse disorder. Applicant admitted to this conduct in his April 2022 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.d) \nApplicant\u2019s Drug Activity \nApplicant began using marijuana when he was in high school (about 1980). The \nfrequency of his use then and while in college was about two times a week. As he became \nolder, his recreational use of marijuana coincided with his alcohol consumption, discussed \nbelow. He continued to use marijuana recreationally through the years. He would stop for \na period if he needed to take a drug test for employment purposes. He used marijuana \nbecause it relaxed him. In 2021, he used marijuana about once a month. He stopped \nusing it in December 2021. That was his last use of marijuana. He had tapered off his use \nbecause he was not enjoying using it as he had in the past. He stopped in December \n2021 so he could pass a drug test when he applied for his current position.

(Tr. 27-28, 30, 77-78; GE \n1, 2 (pp. 3, 13-14)) \nApplicant was the trustee of his late uncle\u2019s estate and was cleaning out his uncle\u2019s \napartment after his death in approximately September 2018, when he discovered a bottle \ncontaining 25 OxyContin pills. He ingested the pills over the next two years by taking one \nor two at a time. He did not have a lawful prescription for these pills. He took them because \nhe liked how they relaxed him. He took the last OxyContin pill in September 2020 and \nhas not taken any more since then. (Tr. 30-32, 53, 70; GE 2 (p. 3)) \nApplicant testified that he has no intention to use any illegal drugs in the future, \nincluding marijuana and OxyContin. He also provided a written statement of intent not to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 33; Answer Exh. 11) \nApplicant\u2019s Alcohol Use \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol while in high school and continued through \ncollege and beyond. He enjoys drinking alcohol, and he did not believe he had a problem. \nHis drinking increased in 2008 probably because he stopped smoking cigarettes and \nmarijuana for a time. By 2010 he was drinking 10 to 12 drinks per night. His preferred \ndrink was wine and some brandy. Sometime in 2010, friends and family approached him \nabout his excessive drinking. This motivated him to get treatment. Additionally, at about \nthe same time, a coworker said she could smell alcohol on him at work. He claimed he \ndid not drink at work, but he would stay up late at night and into the early morning drinking \nup to 12 drinks of alcohol, which was probably still in his system the next day at work. His \nprimary care physician had diagnosed him with episodic alcohol abuse disorder in late \n2010 or early 2011. His wife also served him with divorce papers about this time. (Tr. 34-\n35, 53-55, 63, 67-68, 74; GE 2 (pp.11-12)) \nIn June 2010, Applicant voluntarily entered an inpatient alcohol-treatment facility. \nIt was a 30-day program. He admitted that he drank either the day before entering \ntreatment or the day he entered it. He did not drink while in treatment. He claimed that it \nchanged his attitude toward drinking and that it was \u201clife changing\u201d for him. He completed \nthe program in July 2010. No treatment records are included in the record. Outpatient \ntreatment was recommended for Applicant after he completed his inpatient treatment, but \nhe did not pursue additional treatment because \u201clife got in the way.\u201d He remained sober \nfor about six months after his treatment, then he resumed consuming alcohol. Between \n2011 and 2023, he estimated that he remained sober for six or seven different time \nperiods. His longest period of alcohol abstention was about 13 months, from January \n2019 to April 2020. He admitted that he used marijuana and OxyContin during this period. \nHis other periods of alcohol abstention were about two to three months. He resumed \ndrinking alcohol regularly in 2020 during COVID.

He has continued to participate in AA irregularly through the \nyears. After completing treatment in 2010, he attended 90 AA meetings in 90 days. At \nthat time, he was going to three to four meetings a week. He established a home AA \ngroup in 2010 and continues to attend those group meetings. He admitted that the longest \nperiod of sobriety for which he received an AA sobriety chip was one year. He has \nreceived a one-day sobriety chip three to four times over the years. A one-day chip \nsignifies the first day of sobriety. He admitted having an AA sponsor at one time, but he \nhas not had a sponsor since 2012. He currently attends AA meetings two times a week. \nHis participation is corroborated by two other AA group members.

He \nattended a concert where he drank two 16-ounce beers and two 16-ounce margaritas. \nHe believed he was okay to drive home because he walked around for awhile after the \nconcert to give the alcohol a chance to wear off. He proceeded to drive home. He was \nstopped by law enforcement for speeding. He was clocked going 61 miles-per-hour in a \n45 MPH speed zone. Later his blood was drawn and tested, which revealed a blood-\nalcohol content of .08, the legal level of intoxication. He ultimately reached a plea \nagreement and pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He was sentenced to one year of \nunsupervised probation and payment of fines and fees. These included fees for attending \na DUI education class and a Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) panel. He complied \nwith all his sentencing requirements. He has not had any further arrests since this \nincident. He admitted that he has driven five to six times after having drunk alcohol since \nthis arrest. He claimed his consumption on those occasions was one or two drinks. He \ntestified that he continued to drink alcohol after this arrest \u201cbecause I enjoyed drinking.\u201d \n(Tr. 37-43, 64; GE 2 (pp. 10-11); Answer Exh. 12) \nIn addition to AA, Applicant also participates in a faith-based alcohol recovery \ngroup. He began attending that group in approximately 2015. His attendance is \ncorroborated by another group member. He finds both group meetings helpful. While he \nhas attended both AA and this group over the years, he has also continued to consume \nalcohol during the same time. (Tr. 46-49; Answer Exh. 10) \nApplicant claims that he completely stopped drinking alcohol on July 17, 2023, and \nhas been abstinent since then. Before this claimed cessation, from April 2022 to July 17, \n2023, he would drink a bottle of wine each night at home. Occasionally, he also would \nhave mixed drinks and beer with the wine. He did not believe he was intoxicated each \nnight, but he also believed he had too much alcohol to be able to drive. The reasons he \nstopped his alcohol consumption was for health reasons and to keep his job. On \nDecember 7, 2023, Applicant signed a letter of intent expressing that he would not \nconsume any alcohol while holding a security clearance and offering to take random \nalcohol tests.

(AE A1-A2; Answer Exh. 2-5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here supports mitigation in the form of Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of his past \ndrug use on his SCA, his abstinence since 2021, and his signed letter of intent of nonuse \nin the future. The guidance also states that violation of federal drug laws remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of security clearance eligibility. (See ES 2021-\n01529) \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nApplicant admitted using marijuana on various occasions from about 1980 to about \nDecember 2021. He admitted purchasing marijuana from friends and at state-sponsored \nmarijuana dispensaries. He admitted using the prescription narcotic OxyContin, without \nhaving a lawful prescription, at various times from about September 2018 to about \nSeptember 2020. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant last use of marijuana was in December 2021. He used OxyContin over \na two-year period ending in 2020 and he has not used it since then. His access to \nOxyContin was a unique circumstance and unlikely to happen again. He provided a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all future illegal drug use. Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence since 2021 is sufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. The \nfrequency and recency of his past use does not cast doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder;    \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and   \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder \nApplicant admitted his alcohol consumption, periodically to excess, from \napproximately 1980 to July 17, 2023. His excess drinking included as much as 12 drinks \na night in approximately 2010; having friends intervene for him in 2010 and recommend \nthat he seek alcohol treatment; showing up for work after a night of drinking to the extent \nthat coworkers could smell alcohol emanating from him in approximately 2010; having his \nprimary care physician diagnose him with episodic alcohol abuse disorder in \napproximately 2010; participating in a 30-day alcohol treatment program in 2010, but \ndeclining to follow that up with an outpatient program; being arrested for a DUI offense in \n2013, with a blood alcohol content of .08; and participating in AA from about May 2010 \nthrough the present, but continuing to drink as much as a whole bottle of wine each night \nfrom April 2022 to July 17, 2023. All the above listed disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;    \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and   \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a 40-year history of excessive drinking, which led to a DUI arrest, \ntreatment for excessive alcohol use, and a diagnosis of episodic alcohol abuse disorder, \ninter alia. While he has had periods of sobriety over the years, he also has always \nreturned to consuming alcohol at some point. He has done this despite his alcohol \ntreatment, his alcohol arrest, and his continued participation in AA and a religious-based \nsupport group. Now Applicant claims that since he has totally abstained from alcohol for \napproximately eight months (since July 2023) that he will continue to do so in the future \ndespite his history to the contrary. He has not demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption. The evidence does not support the full application of \nany of these mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, his \ncharacter statements, his work evaluations, and his admissions to his alcohol and drug \nactivity in his SCA from April 2022. However, I also considered the evidence of his pattern \nof alcohol abuse over the course approximately 40 years. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. The drug \ninvolvement security concerns are mitigated. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He left the private company in July 2021, after becoming \na naturalized United States citizen. In August 2021, he began working for his current \nemployer, a major U. S. defense contractor. (Item 2 at 18-21, Item 3 at 9-11; AE A) \nApplicant has an Israeli retirement account, described as similar to a 401k, which \nexceeded the value of $400,000 USD in February 2023. He disclosed that he is entitled \nto receive about $2,000 USD per month from retirement funds beginning in 2040, until \nabout August 2063. He and his wife also have a joint Israeli bank account, valued at about \n$800 USD. (Item 2, Item 3 at 2,9-12; AE A) \nApplicant got married in Israel in 2000. His wife, also an Israeli-born citizen, is a \npermanent United States resident, in the process of becoming a naturalized United States \ncitizen. They have three children, ages 23, 19, and 16 years. All were born in Israel, and \nare citizens of Israel, Romania, and the United States. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Israel.

If he \nwere to remove the funds before his retirement age of 67 years, he would have to pay a \n35% tax on the money, which he chose to avoid. He denied he and his wife are due to \nreceive retirement benefits from the Israeli government in the future. He stated his wife \nworked as an elementary school teacher, and that her salary and retirement benefits as \na public-school teacher, are paid by the Israeli education ministry, a branch of the Israeli \ngovernment. (Response to SOR; Items 2, 3) \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on October 2, 2021. He \ntraveled to Israel to visit family and friends eight times between 2014 and 2021. (Item 2 \nat 50-70; Item 3 at 10-11) \nIsrael & the Palestinian Territories  \nIsrael is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Although it has no written \nconstitution, its parliament, the unicameral 120-member Knesset, has enacted a series \nof \u201cBasic Laws\u201d that enumerate certain rights and freedoms. Members of the Knesset, \nincluding the prime minister, are elected in free and fair elections. Under the Basic Laws, \nthe Knesset has the power to dissolve itself and mandate elections. Israel, in recent years \nhas experienced an unprecedented period of political instability, holding five legislative \nelections between April 2019 and November 2022. Former Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu returned to office in late 2022, and continued his dominance of Israel's political \nlandscape at the head of Israel's most rightwing and religious government. (Item 4) \nSince the beginning, the United States and Israel have enjoyed strong bilateral \nrelations based primarily on common democratic values and security interests, though \nthe relationship has been far from perfect. (Item 4) \nTerrorism remains an ongoing issue in Israel, with a notable increase in violence \nand terrorist attacks occurring since 2021, and further escalating in 2023. On October 7, \n2023, the terrorist organization Hamas conducted an unprecedented attack on Israeli \ncitizens, massacring 1,300 Israelis citizens, including 31 or more U.S. citizens.

The United States immediately rushed \nsecurity assistance to Israel to enable Israeli defense forces to restore security and to \nprotect the Israeli people. The United States as Israel\u2019s strongest defense partner is \ncommitted to supporting the protection and security of Israel. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

It \nfurther alleges he maintains an Israeli retirement account valued at about $400,000 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g), and that he and his wife stand to receive retirement benefits from the Israeli \ngovernment (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, except SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, denying that he and his wife would receive retirement benefits from the Israeli \ngovernment. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) are applicable. The current country conditions in Israel \nand the Palestinian Territories, especially following the terrorist attacks of October 7, \n2023, establish the heightened-risk element of the analysis. Conditions in Israel are such \nthat there is an ongoing risk of armed conflict, potentially extending beyond Israel to the \nbroader Middle East, and a continuation of violence and terrorist attacks in Israel. Given \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to Israel, his 22-year service in the Israeli army, and his significant \nfinancial interest in Israel, the disqualifying conditions listed above apply in this case. \nNotwithstanding the above, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h are found in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant reported the passing of his father in AE B, rendering the \nallegation in SOR 1.c moot. He also denied that he and his wife will receive retirement \nbenefits from the Israeli government. The Government presented substantial evidence \nthat his wife will likely receive retirement benefits from the Israeli government due to her \nprior employment as a public-school teacher in Israel. However, no such evidence was \npresented concerning the Applicant. Though Applicant admitted in SOR \u00b6 1.g, that he will \nreceive a private retirement benefit based on his previous employment with a private \ncompany in Israel, he denied he will receive retirement benefits from the Israeli \ngovernment; and the Government\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that he will. The \nfact that his wife will likely receive a retirement benefit from the Israeli government is not \ndisqualifying for him in this case. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three potentially \napply in this case: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization and interests of the U.S.; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nThe current country conditions in Israel present a heightened risk, which places a \nheavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Israel, the significant ongoing terrorist activities in Israel, and the risk \nof armed conflict within Israel, with the potential to expand beyond its borders to the \nbroader Middle East. I am unable to conclude it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof the Israeli government or his family members, including his in-laws, who are citizens \nand residents of Israel. Applicant was raised, educated, and lived in Israel until the age \nof 40. He understandably has close ties to his family in Israel. He communicates with \nthem frequently, and visits them regularly. \nApplicant also served in the Israeli army for 22 years, before he was discharged \nas a Captain. He did not disclose his roles or responsibilities as an officer in the Israeli \narmy. Whatever his role, the Israeli government required him to serve 18 additional years \nin its army before he was allowed to be discharged. The Appeal Board has held that prior \nforeign military service raises significant questions that require scrutiny in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 10-00824 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 6, 2012); see also ISCR Case No. 14-03112 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015). During \nhis interview with a DOD investigator, Applicant was given an opportunity to discuss his \n22-year service as an officer in the Israeli army; he declined to discuss his foreign military \nservice. \nThere is insufficient evidence to find that there is no conflict of interest either \nbecause Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person or Israel is so \nminimal; or because he has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States interest. I am unable to conclude that his ties to the United States are \nparamount. Applicant\u2019s significant financial interest, a 401k-like retirement account from \na previous employer in Israel, is also problematic. \nThe three mitigating conditions noted above do not apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s \nforeign influence security concern. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I also considered that Applicant offered \ninsufficient evidence in response to the SOR and he did not submit any documentary \nevidence or explanation concerning his service in the Israeli army for 22 years. I conclude \nhe did not present sufficient evidence to sustain his heavy burden of persuasion \nnecessary to overcome security concerns established by his 22-year service in the Israeli \narmy, his significant Israeli retirement funds, and his close connections to his family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of Israel. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts concerning \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 29 years old. In 2017, he graduated from college with a degree in aerospace engineering. He is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in computer science. While attending college, starting in 2013, he was in an Army ROTC program. Additionally, he drilled with an Army Reserve (USAR) unit on a monthly basis where random drug testing occurred. Upon his graduation in 2017, he was also commissioned as a second lieutenant in the USAR. He currently holds the rank of captain (CPT) in the USAR. He has been employed with defense contractors since 2017. He has worked for his current employer since July 2022. He has held a security clearance since 2017.

Applicant testified, offered the testimony of three \nwitnesses, and offered exhibits (AE) A and B (pages 1-106; note also these exhibits are \nsubstantially the same as Enclosures 1-15 attached to his SOR answer). These exhibits \nwere admitted without objection.

His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. In 2017, he graduated from college with a degree in \naerospace engineering. He is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in computer science. \nWhile attending college, starting in 2013, he was in an Army ROTC program. Additionally, \nhe drilled with an Army Reserve (USAR) unit on a monthly basis where random drug \ntesting occurred. Upon his graduation in 2017, he was also commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the USAR. He currently holds the rank of captain (CPT) in the USAR. He \nhas been employed with defense contractors since 2017. He has worked for his current \nemployer since July 2022. He has held a security clearance since 2017. He married in \nOctober 2022, and has no children. (Tr. 55-56, 60-63, 90, 100; GE 1-2; AE B (pp. 28, 32-\n35)) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana/THC, with varying \nfrequency, from about August 2020 until at least January 2021, while granted access to \nclassified information (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used psilocybin mushrooms twice in about July \n2020, while granted eligibility for access to classified information (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that \nhe used MDMA (ecstasy) in about August 2019, while granted access to classified \ninformation (SOR \u00b6 1.c). All three allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a). \nApplicant denied using any illegal drugs while in high school or college. While he \nattended college, he drilled with his USAR unit about eight times a year. He participated \nin drug testing on several occasions when he was randomly selected on drill weekends. \nHe never tested positive. His USAR unit randomly tests 100 percent of its assigned \nSoldiers at least once a year. He estimated that he has been tested two to three times a \nyear by his USAR unit over the years. He took pre-employment drug tests before he was \nhired by his first two defense contractor-employers. He believes he was informed of their \nzero tolerance drug policies when hired. (Tr. 34-35, 66, 88, 90-92) \nApplicant admitted using marijuana from about August 2020 to January 2021, \nwhich was his last use. He moved to his current state of residence in 2019. This state has \nlegalized marijuana use, while still prohibited under federal law. He found it difficult \nmeeting people when he first moved and then COVID-19 hit in 2020 making it even more \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndifficult to do so. He was exploring his community one day and came across a legal \nmarijuana dispensary and entered out of curiosity. He ended up buying a package of \nmarijuana gummies. He believed there were about 10 gummies in the package. Over the \ncourse of the next several months he ingested the gummies when he was bored or it was \nthe weekend and he had nothing better to do. He only purchased this one package of \nmarijuana gummies and he used the last one sometime in January 2021. He has not \npurchased or used marijuana gummies since then. While he held a security clearance \nduring these uses, he did not have access to classified information because at that time \nhe was working on a commercial program, not a DOD program. He acknowledged the \nconcern about his marijuana use by stating, \u201cI understand that it shows a lack of good \njudgment.\u201d (Tr. 68-70, 101; SOR answer; AE A, B (pp. 32-35)) \nApplicant admitted using illegal mushrooms twice in about July 2020, while on a \ncamping trip. He went on the trip with a friend of a friend whom he really did not know that \nwell. He also did not know the rest of the campers. He was sitting around the campfire \none night and was offered a dose of the mushrooms. He accepted and ingested the dose. \nLater during the trip, he took a second dose while they were kayaking. Before he went on \nthe trip, he was unaware there would be illegal drugs present. He did not enjoy this \nexperience. He no longer associates with the friend. He characterized this experience as \na \u201cone off\u201d where he was offered drugs by a group of people he did not know and he \nmade a bad decision by using the substance twice. Similar to his marijuana use, he \npossessed a security clearance at the time of his mushroom use, but he did not have \naccess to classified information at the time because he was working on a commercial \nproject. (Tr. 72-73, 101-102; AE B (pp. 32-35)) \nApplicant admitted using ecstasy one time in August 2019. He went on a cruise \nwith his sister and her boyfriend (now husband). One night the boyfriend brought out \nsome ecstasy and Applicant ingested it. He has never used it since that time. As far as \nhe knows, his sister\u2019s husband has not used or possessed it since that time. At the time \nof his use, he had access to classified information. During that time he accessed classified \ninformation on a daily basis. (Tr. 74-78; 102; AE B (pp.32-35)) \nApplicant disclosed all his illegal drug abuse on his September 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA). Earlier, in the spring or summer of 2021, he had an informal \ndiscussion with his facility security officer (FSO) about his marijuana use in the context of \nwhether Applicant should seek a top secret clearance. After this discussion, he was \nadvised that he should not proceed with completing a top secret SCA. The record is silent \nas to the reason for his completion of the September 2022 SCA. (Tr. 95; GE 1) \nApplicant admitted that when he used ecstasy and mushrooms, he allowed himself \nto be influenced by others, in a bad way. He knew from his early days as a cadet in college \nthat using illegal drugs was prohibited. He testified that he has no future intent to use any \nillegal substances in the future. He also provided a written statement expressing this \nintent. In May 2023, after the issuance of his SOR, he completed a four-hour Drug \nawareness program. He received a certificate of completion, but no details about the \nprogram were provided.

(Tr. 70, 103-105; AE B (pp.37, 39)) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant called three witnesses to testify for him (W1, W2, W3). W1 is one of \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisors at his civilian position. W1 holds a security clearance. W1 \nhas known him for about one year. W1 described him as a valuable member of the team \nwho is trustworthy, dependable, reliable, responsible, and whose judgment is great. \nApplicant told W1 about his drug use. All of it occurred before W1 knew him. W1 was \nsurprised to learn of his drug use. W1 was aware he held a security clearance at the time \nof his uses. W1 also provided a written letter supporting Applicant. (Tr. 21-26; AE B (p. \n87)) \nW2 is Applicant\u2019s current USAR company commander, a captain in the USAR who \nholds a security clearance. W2 described Applicant as one of his top performers and \nsomeone he relies upon to accomplish necessary tasks. W2 made him a team leader. \nApplicant also has a reputation in the unit as someone who gets things done. He has \nparticipated in random unit drug tests on multiple occasions with no positive results. He \ncame to W2 and told him about his marijuana use. W2 was unaware the use occurred \nwhile Applicant held a security clearance. W2 could not remember if he also told him \nabout using illegal mushrooms and ecstasy. W2 admitted that Applicant\u2019s drug use \ncaused him concern about his behavior. W2 felt that Applicant\u2019s willingness to come \nforward and admit his wrongdoing showed his integrity. W2 also provided a written letter \nsupporting Applicant. (Tr. 28, 30-35, 40-41; AE B (pp. 82-83)) \nW3 is a personal friend of Applicant. W3 knows Applicant through Applicant\u2019s wife. \nStarting in July 2020, W3 and Applicant\u2019s wife were roommates for about two years. W3 \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s past drug use through his admissions to her. W3 sees Applicant \nsocially about one time a week. During all their social interaction, she has never seen him \nuse any illegal substances. W3 described Applicant as a reliable person. W3 gave an \nexample of how Applicant assisted her when she was experiencing financial difficulties \nby helping W3 set up a budget plan that got W3\u2019s finances back on track. W3 trusted him \nwith personal information in the process. W3 holds a security clearance and believes \nApplicant has the necessary traits to hold a clearance. W3 also provided a written letter \nsupporting Applicant. (Tr. 48-51; AE B (pp. 43-44)) \nIn addition to the testimony and letters from W1, W2, and W3, other personal \nfriends and professional colleague have provided letters of support for Applicant. All \ngenerally express the same sentiment, that he is reliable, trustworthy, and responsible. \nThey believe his past infrequent drug use is not reflective of his true self. (AE B (pp. 41-\n46, 81-87))  \nApplicant also provided his completed civilian performance appraisals from 2020 \nand 2021, which reflect \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d contributions.

He \nprovided documentation showing he has been awarded an Army Achievement Medal with \none oak leaf cluster. (AE B (pp. 89-95, 97-106)) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use is supported by his admissions. However, concerning his \nadmitted use of marijuana at various times from August 2020 to January 2021, and his \nuse of illegal mushrooms two times in July 2020, while he held a security clearance at \nthat time, there is no evidence that he had access to classified information during the time \nframe alleged. I find that AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to all three allegations, but that AG \u00b6 25(f) \nonly applies to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nOf all of Applicant\u2019s drug use, his marijuana use was the most frequent and recent. \nHe used it about ten times from August 2020 to January 2021. His illegal mushroom use \noccurred twice in 2020, and his ecstasy use once in 2019. He credibly claimed that he \nhas not used any illegal drugs since January 2021. He signed a letter of intent not to use \nillegal drugs in the future and testified to the same. He completed a drug awareness \ncourse in May 2023. He receives partial mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 26(a), because his \nuse was infrequent and somewhat remote. However, full mitigation cannot be applied \nbecause his decisions to use illegal drugs on three different occasions, while holding a \nsecurity clearance, shows extremely poor judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. This \nis particularly true because of his USAR background and his knowledge that drug use is \nunacceptable as a Soldier and as a clearance holding contractor employee. \nApplicant acknowledged his past drug use to both his civilian and military \nsuperiors, disclosed his use on his 2022 SCA, and provided a statement of intent to refrain \nfrom using illegal drugs in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) fully applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted drug involvement and substance misuse is cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress during the period of time before he reported his drug activity. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e) and 16(c) are applicable, as well as the general concerns expressed in AG \n\u00b6 15. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s decisions to use three different illegal drugs during three different time \nframes trouble me very much. He is someone who has been exposed to the illegality of \nillegal drug use since he was a cadet in college and first joined the USAR in 2013. He \nwas drug tested then, drug tested before he started his first two civilian contractor \npositions, and drug tested regularly as a current drilling USAR officer. He acknowledged \nexcising poor judgment by using these drugs. He also acknowledged that on two \noccasions he was influenced by others to engage in drug abuse. So, I must reconcile his \notherwise outstanding civilian and military record and the support he received from his \nfriends and colleagues, against his decisions, on three separate occasions, to put at risk \nhis civilian and military careers by using illegal drugs. Given his established track record, \nI have doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, his military \nservice, the supportive testimony of his friends and colleagues, and his drug education \ncourse. However, I also considered Applicant\u2019s history of using three different drugs \nduring three time periods, all while holding a security clearance. Although I believe \nApplicant mitigated his drug misconduct and believe it will not recur, I cannot say the \nsame about the poor decision process he went through on three separate occasions and \ntherefore cannot mitigate his personal conduct. Overall the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He said he would pay \nthe debt but did not submit documentary evidence he had done so. (Tr. 95-97, 168-170) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit account charged off. Applicant admitted the allegation and \nstated he was researching the account and would settle if necessary. (Answer) Credit \nreports from June and November 2022, and September 2023 show the account was \nopened or assigned in September 2019, charged off for $1,400, and purchased by a debt \nbuyer with a balance of $0. (GE 3 at 7, GE 4 at 3, GE 5 at 6) Applicant testified he did not \nknow if he had paid the debt off or not.

(Answer) A November 2022 \ncredit report shows the mortgage was opened or assigned in December 2018, and past \ndue for $40,257 with a balance of $196,251. (GE 4 at 3) A September 2023 credit report \nshows the mortgage in forbearance with a balance of $204,388. (GE 3 at 4) Applicant \ntestified the home was sold in October 2023 and that after the mortgage and sale related \nexpenses were paid, he received about $19,000. He said he had evidence to corroborate \nhis testimony. I informed him of the importance of providing documentary evidence, but \nhe did not submit any.

He filed most of the overdue returns with the assistance of a professional tax \npreparer after a July 2022 interview with a government investigator. He entered a \npayment plan and started paying the overdue taxes, and at some point, his wages were \ngarnished. He has not made any payments since about June 2023. He filed the overdue \nreturns because it was necessary to obtain a job that required a security clearance, and \nrequired to obtain a passport so he could travel with his girlfriend. He estimated he owes \nthe IRS about $25,000. He was informed of the significance of timely filing income tax \nreturns and of tax delinquencies, and of the importance of providing documentary \nevidence of tax filings, payment plans and payments made. (Tr. 112-129; 153-175) \nApplicant owns a 2000 model year truck, has about $800 in the bank, and does \nnot have a retirement account.

(Tr. 150-153, 129-130, 175-184) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his June 2022 SCA by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to a question about whether in the last seven years he failed to file or pay \nfederal income taxes when required and thereby deliberately failed to disclose his failure \nto timely file federal income tax returns for TY 2016-2019 and TY 2021. Applicant admitted \nthe allegation and explained that he subsequently filed all delinquent federal income tax \nreturns. (GE 1 at 28; Answer) \nDuring a July 8, 2022, subject interview (SI) with a government investigator, \nApplicant disclosed he had not filed some federal income tax returns and that he owed \noverdue taxes. The SI does not indicate the interviewer confronted Applicant with facts \nregarding delinquent tax filings or overdue taxes before his disclosure. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator he forgot about the taxes when completing his June 2022 SCA, \nthat he had completed the delinquent returns and would file them. He further relayed to \nthe government investigator that he had not filed the returns because he did not have \nsufficient funds to pay taxes due, and said that he owed $3,968 for TY 2016, $2,389 for \nTY 2017, $993 for TY 2018, and $23 for TY 2021.

(GE 2 at 7-9; Tr. 126-128, 146-149, 170-177)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his June 2022 SCA by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to questions about routine account delinquencies in the past seven years, \nand that he deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j. \n(GE 1 at 28) Applicant\u2019s written response to this allegation is not completely legible, and \nhe testified he did not admit this allegation, might have misunderstood the question, that \nhe had paid or had made arrangements to pay off many of the delinquent debts, and that \nhe did not intentionally falsify his SCA response. (Answer; Tr. 147-149) \nDuring the SI, Applicant disclosed two delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h) but \nlisted no other delinquent accounts. The interviewer then confronted him with 11 \ndelinquent accounts listed in a June 2022 credit report, including at least six debts alleged \nin the SOR. Applicant confirmed all but one of the 11 delinquent accounts and said he \nhad not listed them because he did not have enough information. He said he had just \nstarted a better paying job so that he could resolve the debts. (GE 2 at 7-9) \nIn response to questioning about why he did not disclose his delinquent debts in \nthe 2022 SCA, he said: \nWith the opportunity I had in front of me I wanted to try and get at least in \nthe door where I could get everything going so I can go back and clear up \na lot of the information . . . I could have been more truthful, but I figured it \nwould have hurt me then more so (sic) than it hurts me now. That\u2019s the way \nI looked at it. . . . talking to you about it right now it's still an embarrassment \nfor me because I knew had I asked or talked to someone, taken different \nsteps, it could have been a different outcome. . . . I'm just now getting to a \npoint in my life where I can look back and say I made some of the stupidest \ndecisions, but going forward, I am a lot more mature now. . . . I could have \ndone a lot of different things back then that I'm trying to do now only because \nI have a different outlook on life. (Tr. 174-176) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentary evidence regarding debt payments, contact with creditors, income tax filings \nand payments, and efforts to address or resolve his financial problems.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence showing he failed to timely \nfile federal income tax returns or pay taxes due, and other delinquent debts establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s income tax and other financial problems \nare ongoing and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. His \nbehavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment, underemployment, and his family\u2019s health problems \nwere conditions largely beyond his control but his failure to timely file some federal income \ntax returns was not. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and \n1.g-1.h. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established for debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \n1.e-1.f, and  1.j, or for the delinquent federal income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l because \nhe has not provided sufficient evidence he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial \ncounseling for his indebtedness and his financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.g-\n1.h. It is not established for delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e-1.f, and  1.j, \nor for the delinquent federal income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l because Applicant failed \nto submit documentary evidence those debts are resolved or are being resolved.  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not provided documentary evidence \nof a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established for Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal income \ntax returns alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. It is not established for delinquent federal income taxes \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nApplicant entered payment agreements with the IRS to pay delinquent federal \nincome taxes for TY 2016-2019 in 2022 but submitted no documentary evidence of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments made in compliance with the agreements. As of April 12, 2023, he owed \n$21,719 in overdue taxes, interest, and penalties and there is no documentary evidence \nof any payment on the overdue federal taxes since at least November 2022. \nAlthough Applicant has filed delinquent federal income tax returns for TY 2016\u00ad\n2019 and 2021, his eventual compliance with some of his tax filing obligations does not \nend the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It \nis an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Failure to \ncomply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-\nestablished government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems \nis essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nPersonal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nApplicant\u2019s admission, June 2022 SCA responses, interview with a \ngovernment investigator, and testimony establish the following disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.a because Applicant promptly corrected the \nfalsification during an interview with a government investigator. It is not fully established \nfor SOR \u00b6 2.b because he disclosed only two of 13 delinquent debts before he was \nconfronted with evidence derived from a June 2022 credit report. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Applicant\u2019s falsifications \noccurred more than two years ago under circumstances unlikely to recur. He credibly \ntestified that he has learned from his mistakes, now understands the importance of being \ntruthful in response to security significant questions and is more mature. His conduct does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, employment history, military service, efforts to provide financial support to a \nterminally ill family member, limited financial resources and that his financial problems \nwere caused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control.

DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 1, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.j, 1.m, 1.t, 1.v, and 1.w, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated as findings \nof fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nthis employer since 2021. He experienced a period of unemployment during the COVID \npandemic. He is married with four children, three of whom are minors. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and has worked towards a master\u2019s. (Tr. at 6, 36; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant accumulated 19 delinquent (consumer and medical) \ndebts totaling approximately $33,400 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.s). The allegations are supported \nby his disclosures in his trustworthiness application in December 2021; statements to a \ndefense investigator during his background investigation in March 2022; credit reports \nfrom March 2022, December 2022, June 2023, and January 2024; admissions in his \nSOR answer; and admissions during his hearing testimony. (Tr. 41-50; GE 1-6; SOR \nAnswer) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2020 and 2021, and that he owes the IRS for unpaid taxes in the approximate \namount of $2,771 for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.v). It further alleged that \nApplicant owed state A $1,671 for delinquent taxes; and that he failed to file his 2019\u00ad\n2021 state B income tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.w). The allegations are supported \nby admissions in his trustworthiness application, statements to a defense investigator \nduring his background investigation in March 2022, and his answers to interrogatives in \nApril 2023. (GE 1-2; SOR Answer) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts and tax problems to his illnesses (not \nspecially identified) and his layoff during COVID. He also candidly admitted that he \nprocrastinated and put things off. It was not until about a year ago, after he received the \nSOR that he was motivated into action. He is the sole wage earner in his household \nbecause his wife is devoted to homeschooling their children. In his SOR answer he \nindicated that he was working with his company\u2019s financial advisors on ways to pay his \ndebt. During his testimony, he admitted he has not \u201cengaged\u201d them. (Tr. 32, 35, 38, 40 \n57) \nApplicant testified that he admitted his responsibility for all the debts and he only \nquestioned the current amounts owed and who were the proper current creditors or \ncollection services to pay.

(Tr. 49-50) \nApplicant testified consistently regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h and 1.i through \n1.s) as follows: he admitted all the debts, he has not made any recent payments toward \nany of them, and he does not remember the last time he made any payments, but it \nwould not have been within the last year. He negotiated a settlement and paid SOR \u00b6 \n1.j in March 2023. Only SOR \u00b6 1.j is resolved. (Tr. 41-50; SOR Answer)  \nApplicant blamed his untimely tax return filings on COVID and his own \nirresponsibility. He documented that he set up a payment plan with the IRS to pay \nmonthly payments of $40 to resolve his debt for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.t). He \ndocumented that he set up a payment plan with state A, where he made his initial \npayment of $250 in January 2024, and he is obligated to make $100 monthly payments \nthrough April 2025 (SOR \u00b6 1.u). He documented that he mailed his 2020 and 2021 \nfederal tax returns and his 2019 through 2021 state B tax returns on June 15, 2023 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.w). (Tr. 50-54; AE B, H; SOR Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant accumulated 19 delinquent debts totaling approximately $33,400. He \nfailed to timely file his federal (2020-2021) and state (2019-2021) tax returns and he \nowed delinquent taxes to state A and the federal government for tax year 2018. I find all \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Except for one settled debt, Applicant has not \ndocumented payment towards the remaining SOR debts. While his medical issues and \nCOVID were circumstances beyond his control, he has not shown responsible action \ntoward addressing his delinquent debt. He admittedly procrastinated in addressing his \ndebts. He has fared no better in addressing his tax issues. He has not provided any \nspecific details about how he plans to address these debts in the future, or documented \nany legitimate dispute he has concerning the debts. He only filed his 2020 and 2021 \nfederal returns and his 2019 through 2021 state B returns after the SOR was issued in \nMay 2023. His dilatory action is contrary to acting in good faith. None of the above \nmitigating conditions fully apply. However, I am giving Applicant some mitigating credit \nfor establishing a payment plan, before the issuance of the SOR, with the IRS to pay his \n2018 delinquent taxes, and state A for his delinquent taxes there. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, his medical issues, and his \nunemployment due to COVID. However, Applicant has not established a meaningful \ntrack record of financial responsibility by paying his debts or handling his state and \nfederal tax issues, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.i, 1.k-1.s, 1.v-1.w:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.j, 1.t-1.u: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 8, 2014, April 21, 2018, and May 17, 2022, Applicant completed and \nsigned Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 27, \n2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication \nServices (DCSA CAS) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline E. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn May 14, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a \nhearing.

The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five Government exhibits (GE), \nand Applicant did not offer any documents. There were no objections, and GE 1 through \n5 were admitted into evidence. On May 16, 2024, DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, and \nhe denied SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and during the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006. He married in \n1992 and has two adult children. He has been employed as an engineer by a federal \ncontractor since January 2019. He currently possesses a secret DOD security clearance \nthat was issued in July 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 16-17) \nPersonal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that, in about 2004, Applicant\u2019s January 2003 interim DOD \nsecurity clearance was revoked, and his final security clearance was denied, due to prior \nmarijuana use. Applicant admitted this allegation in his Answer. Applicant had disclosed \nto the DOD investigator during his background interview that he had used marijuana \nrecreationally, about 10 times, during the period he held the interim security clearance \nfrom January 2003 through April 2004. (Tr. 18-20) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2014 \nuntil at least 2015.

Applicant \nadmitted this in his Answer. \nApplicant listed on his April 2018 e-QIP that he stopped all use of marijuana in \n2004, after his interim security clearance was revoked. Based on this information, he was \ngranted a secret security clearance in July 2019. He admitted, in his Answer and during \nthe hearing, that he deliberately failed to list his most recent illegal drug use on his 2018 \ne-QIP because he was concerned he would not be able to obtain a DOD security \nclearance. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) (Tr. 20-27, 34-35; GE 2) \nApplicant completed another e-QIP in May 2022, after his employer sponsored him \nto obtain a top secret security clearance.

Another background interview \nwas triggered in September 2022, and Applicant was asked again if he had any illegal \ndrug use required to be listed on his May 2022 e-QIP, which he denied. The investigator \nthen confronted him with adverse information that was developed during his background \ninvestigation. Applicant then admitted that he had used marijuana on about five or six \noccasions from 2014 to 2015. He also admitted he had used cocaine one time in 2014. \nHe told the investigator that he did not list the information on his 2022 e-QIP because he \nhad not used illegal drugs in the past seven years. He admitted to the investigator he \nused marijuana and cocaine during the time he was working for another employer (E) \nwhich was not a federal contractor. (Tr. 20-27, 34-35; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant listed on his April 2018 and May 2022 e-QIPs that he worked for E from \nApril 2015 through April 2018, and for another federal contractor from August 2002 to \nApril 2015. So, based on this information and Applicant\u2019s testimony, he actually used \nillegal drugs from approximately 2015 to 2016, not 2014 to 2015 as he previously \nreported. He admitted he intentionally did not disclose this illegal drug use on his April \n2018 e-QIP, as required. During the hearing, he stated that he did not report his illegal \ndrug use on his May 2022 e-QIP because it was past the seven-year cutoff in the \nquestion. The SOR did not allege facts concerning this omission from his May 2022 e-\nQIP. (GE 1, 2; Tr. 27, 38-39) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant falsified his April 2014 e-QIP for failing to disclose \nthat he had used illegal drugs, marijuana and cocaine, in at least 2014. Applicant denied \nfalsifying this e-QIP, and I agree with him based on the evidence in the record indicating \nthat his actual dates of marijuana and cocaine use occurred after April 2015, when he \nwas hired by E. (GE 1; Tr. 35) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 1985 and charged with \npossession of a Class C Controlled Substance, LSD. (Tr. 32) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in July 1996 and charged with \nLarceny. Applicant stated that he had bounced a check for $60. He was required to pay \nrestitution and court costs. (Tr. 32-33) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 1999 and charged with \npossession of a Class B Controlled Substance, hashish. He was pulled over by police \nand he had hashish in his pocket. He went to court and was ordered to pay a fine and \ncourt costs. (Tr. 33) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that, in about March 2022, Applicant received a reprimand from \nhis current employer for bringing a package of flash drives into a restricted area. Applicant \ntestified that he had obtained the flash drives from his employer while he worked in an \nunsecured area. The flash drives would disappear quickly from his employer\u2019s supply \nroom, and he wanted to make certain he had access to some. In August 2021, he was \nmoved to a secure area, and he kept the unopened package of flash drives in his closed \noverhead cupboard. In March 2022, a security officer found the flash drives, and verbally \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreprimanded Applicant. He was also required to repeat security training following this \nsecurity infraction. (Tr. 28-31) \nApplicant testified that he had changed several behaviors to stay away from illegal \ndrugs. He has been a drummer for 48 years, and he used to play music in bars where \nillegal drugs were prevalent. He now only plays his drums in the privacy of his home. He \nalso mentioned that he no longer participates in billiards at bars, and he has moved away \nfrom the city life and now lives in a remote, rural area. He no longer associates with friends \nwho use illegal drugs. His current hobbies include flying remote-controlled airplanes and \ndriving all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). He takes his job responsibilities seriously, and made \nassurances that he would not use illegal drugs since he fully understands the rules he \nmust follow in order to maintain a security clearance. (Tr. 36-39) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his 2018 e-QIP when he failed to disclose, as \nrequired, his illegal use of marijuana and cocaine between approximately 2015 and 2016, \nbecause he was worried listing this information would prevent him from obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant also admitted a withdrawal of an interim security clearance \nin 2004, three incidents of criminal conduct between 1985 and 1999, marijuana use from \n\u201c2015 to 2016,\u201d cocaine use once in \u201c2015,\u201d and a 2022 security infraction at his place of \nemployment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(This was indented on the right. \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there \nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 \n(1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant has a long history of using illegal drugs, but there is no evidence he has \nused any illegal drugs after 2016.

The most recent security incident in 2022 is isolated. Applicant \nreceived a verbal reprimand and was required to undergo security training to ensure this \nwould not happen again. I believe enough time has passed without further incidents of \ncriminal conduct, illegal drug use, or security infractions to find these behaviors are \nunlikely to recur. \nIn ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge should \nconsider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record evidence. See, e.g., \nADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). As a practical matter, a finding \nregarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s \nstatements, but rather may rely on circumstantial evidence. \nThe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an \nSOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence \nfor whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3. \nThe non-SOR conduct will not be considered except for the five purposes listed \nabove. \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, given the actual dates of Applicant\u2019s most recent \nuse of marijuana and cocaine, it is clear that he should have reported his 2015 to 2016 \nillegal drug use on his May 2022 e-QIP. In addition, his statement on the 2022 e-QIP that \nhis marijuana use ceased in about April 2004, after his interim security clearance was \nwithdrawn is, at the very least misleading, if not an outright lie. What is most troubling, \nhowever, is the fact that he did not disclose his most recent illegal drug use until after he \nhad been confronted with adverse information that was developed during the course of \nhis background investigation. Only then did Applicant admit his 2015 to 2016 use of \nmarijuana and cocaine while he was employed by E from April 2015 to April 2018. \nIt is clear in this instance that Applicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification of his illegal drug use from 2015 to \n2016, before being confronted with developed adverse information. He admitted he had \ndeliberately failed to disclose his 2015 to 2016 illegal drug use on his 2018 e-QIP, which \nenabled him to receive a secret security clearance in 2019. I find Applicant remained \nconsistent in omitting this illegal drug use on his 2022 e-QIP, and during his June and \nSeptember 2022 background interviews, in an effort to receive a top secret security \nclearance. Overall, Applicant\u2019s credibility is questionable and continues to cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nE and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, to his credit, has changed his behaviors and association with certain \nfriends to avoid all contact with illegal drugs. He takes his work responsibilities and his \nsecurity clearance seriously. The evidence against mitigation, however, is more \npersuasive in that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2015 to 2016 illegal drug \nuse on his 2018 e-QIP, and although not alleged in the SOR, he intentionally omitted this \ninformation on his 2022 e-QIP and during his June and September 2022 background \ninterviews. He also provided misleading information on the e-QIPs that he ceased all \nmarijuana use in about April 2004. I have taken all of the circumstances into consideration \nunder the whole-person analysis, and I find that he intentionally tried to hide his most \nrecent illegal drug use from the government. He did so in 2018, and he received a security \nclearance in 2019. I believe that was his intention when he did not disclose the 2015 to \n2016 illegal drug use on his 2022 e-QIP, and during his June and September 2022 \nbackground interviews until confronted with adverse information. Overall, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior is untrustworthy, unreliable and does not support a finding of rehabilitation. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Before this 2018 hospitalization, Applicant \nhad not received any sort of psychological or psychiatric counseling. He testified that he \nwas, however, prescribed Prozac at some point prior to 2018, adding that he could not \n\u201crun around as a vegetable and do that.\u201d (Tr. 24-26, 29-30) \nRegarding his inability to recall dates and times, he stated, \u201cI\u2019ve worked six days \na week, 12 hours a day for the last 30 years, it\u2019s all a blur.\u201d (Tr. 27, 29) Applicant stated \nthat he stopped taking Prozac, \u201c[o]nce I found out that my girlfriend was yellin\u2019 at me \nthat ---\u201d (Tr. 30) He did not consult a doctor when he stopped taking Prozac. (Tr. 30-31) \nAnd, since Applicant stopped taking Prozac, he has not seen any medical professionals \nregarding other options, whether it is medication or anything else. (Tr. 31) \nAfter his discharge from the hospital in February 2018, Applicant had counseling \nappointments \u201cfor a couple of months after that and a couple (of) group sessions . . . AA \nmeetings and things like that.\u201d Applicant stated, \u201cThere\u2019s no real cure for alcoholism. I\u2019m \nan alcoholic. I\u2019m going to be an alcoholic for all my life and [all] I can do is try my best \nand work on it and make sure I don\u2019t get in a situation as to cause undue stress to make \nme want to be stupid and think I can self-medicate.\u201d (Tr. 28) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Alleged that Applicant continued to consume alcohol, until at least \nJune 2022, not in accordance with the treatment advice and recommendations as set \nforth in subparagraph 1.a, above. \nApplicant stated that he used to be addicted to alcohol and now he is addicted to \ncoffee. When he attended AA meetings, he found participants telling the same stories \nand did not find too many people who had \u201creally positive messages of getting through \nthings. I guess I didn\u2019t find the right meeting or the right person, but it just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it \nwasn\u2019t something I could do.\u201d (Tr. 33) He did not seek any alternative to AA other than \ngoing to church. (Tr. 33) \nWhen Applicant was hospitalized in February 2018, he was drinking a 12-pack of \nbeer per day twice a week. (Tr. 33) After he was released, he remained sober and has \n\u201cfallen off the wagon several times since then.\u201d (Tr. 33-34) He stated that he remained \nsober for a year until \u201csometime in 2019\u201d and then his drinking would stop and start for a \nfew months. (Tr. 34) As of his hearing date, he had a drink consisting of two Trulies \n(hard seltzer) within the last six months. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant has limited methods to maintain sobriety. He stated with \u201cthis court \nthing . . . has kind of consumed me.\u201d (Tr. 35) He \u201cwas getting into trying to restore an \nold car,\u201d but he is rarely home to work on it. (Tr. 35) Applicant stated that he lives \n\u201cvicariously now through my girlfriend, through my garden.\u201d (Tr. 35) He has been with \nhis girlfriend, who is retired, for 25 years.

(Tr. 48) \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Alleged that in August 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \nclinical psychologist (Dr. D) and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. The \npsychologist opined that his diagnosis is a current significant risk to his judgment, \nreliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information. \nApplicant acknowledged showing up drunk at work during his \u201cheavy drinking \ndays\u201d which would have been before his 2018 treatment. (Tr. 37-38) He also \nacknowledged that, \u201cit would be helpful to talk to someone outside my circle\u201d to deal \nwith his alcoholism and depression. (Tr. 42) He stated that he might consider zoom-type \nappointments if he, \u201ccould stay awake and find time.\u201d He explained: \nI\u2019m not using that as an excuse, but my day starts at 3:30 in the morning. I \nwake up. I eat breakfast. I ride my motorcycle across the bridge to [job \nsite] where I get there at 4:30 to avoid \u2013 to find a place to park. It\u2019s five \no\u2019clock we start work. I get off work at 3:30. It takes an hour and a half to \nget home. I take a shower. I clean up. I try to relax. It\u2019s a long day. . . . \nEvery day for the past 30 years. (Tr. 43) \nApplicant stated his work schedule was typical of those in his industry. He has \nthree weeks of vacation a year and is required to take it. During his vacation he sees his \ndoctor to manage his insulin for his diabetes. Applicant claimed that he is gone 350 \ndays out of the year on travel. (Tr. 45-47) \nThe following is a summary of the two SOR allegations raising the psychological \nconditions concerns. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 Alleged that in February 2018, Applicant was hospitalized for about \none week after expressing suicidal ideations and making threatening comments about \nhis coworkers. He was diagnosed with major depression, recurrent, severe without \npsychosis; alcohol use disorder, mild to moderate/abuse; and moderate to severe \npsychosocial stress (Dr. K). Upon discharge the program recommended that Applicant \nhave individual psychotherapy, a psychiatric follow-up, and attend an intensive \noutpatient program for mood disorder and chemical dependency. It also recommended \nattending AA meetings and to abstain from alcohol. Applicant did not follow those \nrecommendations. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \u2013 In August 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical \npsychologist (Dr. D) and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe; other specified \npersonality disorder; and major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, mild with mixed \nfeatures.

(GE 1; SOR \nAnswer) \nThe following is a summary of the one allegation under the personal conduct \nconcern. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a \u2013 Alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his SF-86, executed \nby him on April 30, 2019, in response to \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity, \u2026 In the last 7 years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and, and thereby, deliberately failed to disclose \nthat he smoked marijuana once every two months prior to his February 2018 \nhospitalization. \nDuring his February 2018 interview with a medical doctor (Dr. K), Applicant \nreported the following drug abuse: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nALCOHOL AND DRUG HISTORY: The patient first tried alcohol and \nmarijuana at age 15. He also tried cocaine and methamphetamine in his \n20s. He reports that he had been increasingly abusing alcohol recently \ndrinking a 12-pack of beer approximately two times per week. He does \nuse marijuana intermittently perhaps once every two months. He does not \nuse any tobacco-related products. (GE 3, pg. 1) \nDuring his 2022 interview with a licensed clinical psychologist (Dr. D), Applicant \nreported the following drug abuse: \n[Applicant] smoked marijuana in high school. He said occasionally he \nwould use it at a party. He said his last use was \u201c4-5 years ago.\u201d He then \nqualified that he may use marijuana up to \u201conce a year.\u201d When asked \nabout other illicit substances, he denied use or having tried any other \nsubstances. This was discrepant as medical records indicated he has \n\u201ctried cocaine and methamphetamine in his 20s.\u201d (Tr. 39-40; GE 4, pgs. 6-\n7) \nIn response to Department Counsel\u2019s question asking him why he did not report \nhis drug use on his 2019 SF-86, Applicant stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I didn\u2019t.\u201d (Tr. 40) \nHe is aware that marijuana use is prohibited as a security clearance holder and \nattributes his past use of marijuana to \u201c[l]ack of poor judgment [sic].\u201d (Tr. 40-41) He \nclaimed that he does not currently possess marijuana, nor does he intend to use it in the \nfuture. He used marijuana in lieu of alcohol \u201cto self-medicate to try to stop drinking, you \nknow.\u201d He stated that course of action did not work and that his marijuana use was \n\u201c[j]ust (in) the more recent years, . . . .\u201d (Tr. 41) \nAPPLICANT\u2019S COMMENTS \nAt the conclusion of questioning and before closing argument, Applicant stated: \nI\u2019d like to say that I am guilty of everything that\u2019s said here. I \u2013 I am not a \nrisk for declaring what I do, what I\u2019ve seen, or who I\u2019ve seen, or anything \nlike that. I am willing to face the consequences of the crime I have \ncommitted.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption and Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 21 states the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 22 provides alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nany intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides psychological conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), \n22(f), 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d). Further details will be discussed in the mitigation \nanalysis, infra. \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nFive psychological mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nDisqualifying Conditions \nDr. D diagnosed Applicant with: (1) 303.90 alcohol use disorder, severe;\n(2) 301.89 other specified personality disorder; and (3) major depressive \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisorder, recurrent episode, mild and mixed features, in August 2022. Dr. D \nconcluded that it would be imprudent to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation, and stated: \nAt present [Applicant\u2019s] symptoms of depression do not appear to be \ntreated as he has discontinued use of psychiatric medications and is \nnot receiving therapy services. [Applicant\u2019s] symptoms are consistent \nwith a history of Major Depressive Episodes, which have occurred \nsince at least 2015 per his report. Despite ongoing symptoms that \nappear more severe in the past, [Applicant] only endorsed mild \nsymptoms currently. \n[Applicant] provided responses that indicate multiple concerns as it \nrelates to substance use, specifically alcohol use. [Applicant] has not \nbeen able to maintain sobriety, and he has endorsed at least two \noccasions in his life where he has developed a tolerance and \ndependence for alcohol. He currently endorses cravings despite \nhaving stopped 3-4 months ago, and he is not engaged with sobriety \nsupport like AA or a chemical dependency or addiction medicine \nprogram. He appears to vacillate between his reports of wanting to \nstop drinking and being unwilling or unable to do so. \n[Applicant] appears to have limited resources to manage his health \nand well-being. He has not engaged in his medical treatment for \nsleep apnea which may be exacerbating underlying illnesses. He has \na stressful job which takes him away from his primary support \nsystem and consistent medical treatment. [Applicant] endorsed \nsymptoms of current withdrawal including cravings. He has a history \nof tolerance to alcohol within the last 6 months. [Applicant\u2019s] \nprognosis is guarded as he does not seem to have been able accept \nthe gravity of his substance use and is in the earliest stages of \nstopping his use. Although he intermittently acknowledged he might \nhave a struggle with alcohol, he has made choices in the last 6 \nmonths which raise concern about his motivation to remain sober. \nThese include stopping his psychiatric medication, not engaging in \nsubstance use treatment, and not adhering to suggestions given by \nprofessionals in the past about his substance use. Additionally, he \nhas not been engaged in programs to assist with his sobriety like \nmental health therapy, AA or a chemical dependency program. \nConclusions: Currently, [Applicant] carries mental health diagnoses \nthat do appear to be a current significant risk to his judgment, \nreliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information. His \nrisk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health problems \nmay also be elevated because of his intermittent relapse and use of \nsubstances and his current diagnosis of depression.

He discussed self-coping mechanisms to include \nrestoring an old car, a long-term supportive relationship with his girlfriend, and \nvicariously maintaining his garden through his girlfriend. He also promised his girlfriend \nthat he would not drink around his seven-month-old granddaughter. He also stated that \nhe can turn to a \u201cfew coworkers\u201d for support but did not elaborate on the extent of \nsupport these coworkers can or are able and willing to provide. His significant absence \nfrom home life, due to the work schedule he described, minimizes positive benefits that \nthese resources can provide. He also is unable or unwilling to make the effort to seek \ntreatment from a qualified medical or mental health professional to address the \nconcerns raised. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant provided incorrect information when he completed his April 30, 2019 \nSF-86 by stating that he had not illegally used any drugs or substances in the last seven \nyears. As noted, he admitted he used marijuana within the previous seven years during \nhis April 6, 2023 SOR answer; however, he equivocated when asked why he did not \nreport this drug use by Department Counsel during his hearing by stating that he did not \nrealize that he had not reported his past drug use. \nAs also noted, he disclosed that he used marijuana intermittently approximately \ntwo times a week perhaps once every two months during his February 2018 medical \ninterview by Dr. K. He more recently confirmed that his last marijuana use was four to \nfive years ago when interviewed by Dr. D in 2022. Such use that would have fallen \nwithin the seven-year window prior to April 2019. This question is straightforward and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neasy to understand. Per his testimony, he has a 40-year history of holding a clearance, \nand he was familiar with the clearance process. His equivocating during his hearing \ntestimony is somewhat perplexing in light of his having admitted to this allegation when \nhe responded to his SOR. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSF-86 were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the Administrative Judge.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation omitted). In ADP Case \nNo. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board recognized the \nimportance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the \nrecord evidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May \n30, 2017). As a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent \nor state of mind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, \nbut rather may rely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nThe record evidence also raises a non-alleged concern under Guideline H, Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse, as a result of Applicant\u2019s admitted drug use while \nholding a clearance. Applicant clearly understood that honestly disclosing material facts \nconcerning this relevant matter would put his national security eligibility at risk. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n13 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. SOR \u00b6 3 alleges Applicant\u2019s false \nstatement occurred on his April 30, 2019 SF-86, which was more than four years ago. \nArguably, this false statement might be mitigated by the passage of time. However, \nApplicant did not honestly and candidly provide relevant security information on this \npoint during his hearing. His denial of such relevant information on his 2019 SF-86 \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the whole-person concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 58-year-old electronics mechanic. He served in the Air Force from \nSeptember 1983 to April 1991 and was honorably discharged as a sergeant.

Nor did he follow through with any of the aftercare or treatment that the health \ncare providers recommended. Applicant averred that his work schedule prevents him \nfrom pursuing any meaningful follow-up to address his alcohol and/or psychological \nissues. \nThe DoD encourages employees to seek needed mental-health and alcohol-\nconsumption therapy and treatment. As set forth in AG \u00b6 27, no negative inference is \ndrawn on the basis of mental-health or alcohol-related counseling or treatment. In that \nregard, individuals are encouraged to seek appropriate treatment. Applicant sought such \ntreatment in February 2018 but did not follow-up with the recommendations of his \ntreating physician. As further noted in Dr. D\u2019s August 2022 report, Applicant\u2019s symptoms \nof depression do not appear to be treated nor has his use of alcohol been adequately \naddressed. See Dr. D\u2019s summary, supra. Dr. D concluded that Applicant\u2019s mental health \ndiagnoses do appear to be a current significant risk to his judgment and reliability or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information. Dr. D also opined that his risk to \njudgment and reliability due to any future mental health problems may also be elevated \nbecause of his intermittent relapse and use of substances and his current diagnosis of \ndepression. \nIn light of the unmitigated alcohol consumption and psychological conditions \nconcerns, and to a lesser extent the unmitigated personal conduct concerns, continuing \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is not deemed prudent or \nwarranted. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact There are eight delinquent accounts alleged in the March 2023 SOR. Each listed creditor has a corresponding account number identifying the account. The origin of the account and account numbers are posted in an applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR). The account numbers are a core set of numbers that at least partly correspond to the account numbers listed in the SOR and CBR, and appear throughout the life of the account. Additional numbers may sometimes be added to the core numbers or appear in place of the core numbers, particularly when the account is sold to a collection agency or firm, but the core numbers of the account always remain the same. (See GE 8 at 10, GE 8 at 4). All the listed accounts in the SOR are credit-card or loan accounts. The total amount of debt is $108,350. The debts became delinquent between August 2011 and June 2022. Though Applicant denied all listed delinquent debts, the denial was based on her claimed inability to track the unauthorized use of her credit cards and other credit instruments that were taken during a theft of her credit cards and computer from her rental car in January 2020. See AE 1i. The Government CBRs confirm the debt delinquencies. (GE 3, 4, 5, 8) 2 Applicant is 46 years old. She has been living with her boyfriend since September 2013. She has no children.

Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 7, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On March 2, 2022, she submitted a second e-QIP. On \nFebruary 14, 2018, September 27, 2022, and October 7, 2022, she provided personal \nsubject interviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue \na security clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nMarch 29, 2023, detailing security concerns raised by the guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG), effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided an undated answer to the SOR. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, 2024, for a \nhearing on April 10, 2024. The hearing was held by Teams video teleconference as \nscheduled. I entered the Government\u2019s eight exhibits (GE) 1-8. GE 6, which was \nadmitted into evidence over Applicant\u2019s objection, will be discussed in Rulings on \nEvidence below. On May 14, 2024, Applicant submitted ten post-hearing exhibits (AE) \n1a through 1j, with a two-page table of contents (AE 1) identifying each attached exhibit. \nOn May 28, 2024, Department Counsel indicated the Government had no objections to \nthe exhibits being admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April \n19, 2024. The record closed on May 28, 2024. \nRulings on Evidence \nAt pages 15 to 20 of the hearing transcript, rulings were made on the \nadmissibility of the Government exhibits. In Applicant\u2019s first reply to whether GE 6 \n(February 14, 2018 PSI) should be admitted into evidence, she responded \u201cI don\u2019t know \nhow relevant the objection is, so no. No, I don\u2019t.\u201d Her response prompted me to ask \nwhether the ambiguity of her response implied that she really did have an objection. \nShe responded that she did have an objection. Department Counsel replied that the \nexhibit be entered into evidence as a business record. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection \nbut recommended that during her testimony she address the portions of the exhibit that \nshe disagreed with. (Tr. 18-19) During the hearing, she did not address her purported \ndisagreements with GE 6. Applicant had no objection to her September 27, 2022 PSI. \n(GE 7) \nFindings of Fact \nThere are eight delinquent accounts alleged in the March 2023 SOR. Each \nlisted creditor has a corresponding account number identifying the account. The origin \nof the account and account numbers are posted in an applicant\u2019s credit bureau report \n(CBR). The account numbers are a core set of numbers that at least partly correspond \nto the account numbers listed in the SOR and CBR, and appear throughout the life of \nthe account.

She has been living with her boyfriend since \nSeptember 2013. She has no children. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2002. \nAfter obtaining a certification in December 2003, she got her master\u2019s degree in July \n2004, and her PhD in May 2021. (GE 1 at 12-14; GE 2 at 12) \nSince April 2017, Applicant has been employed as a senior cybersecurity \nengineer by a defense contractor. She has been employed concurrently as an \ninformation risk analyst since November 2020. She served twice as an adjunct college \nprofessor from January 2017 to January 2019, and January 2016 to December 2016. \n(GE 2 at 13-21; Tr. 31) \nIn her March 2022 security clearance application, Applicant identified several of \nthe delinquent debts listed in the SOR. Those debts are \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c 1.d, and 1.g. \nShe noted a dispute with a department store (not alleged in the SOR) for a delinquent \naccount from 2011, which she believed was no longer enforceable because it was \nremoved from her credit report. (GE 1 at 40-41; GE 7 at 7-8) She noted a wage \ngarnishment (not alleged in the SOR) stemming from a landlord-tenant debt that began \nin 2011 or 2012 which she believed was not her responsibility. Even though she \nconsidered the debt the result of an identification theft, she paid a judgment for the debt \nin March 2022 ,because she did not want to jeopardize her security clearance. (GE 1 at \n42; GE 2 at 36-39) Applicant\u2019s unalleged conduct will not be considered an independent \nbasis to deny or revoke a security clearance. However, it may be considered in \nassessing credibility, to decide the applicability of an adjudicative guideline, or to \nconsider whether an applicant has established successful rehabilitation. I have \nevaluated Applicant\u2019s 2011 department store debt and garnishment for the \naforementioned purposes. Regarding the delinquent debts she listed in her March 2022 \ne-QIP that also appear in the SOR, she noted that she was \u201ccurrently on a budgeted \npay schedule to pay balances and settle outstanding debts.\u201d (GE 2 at 38-39) \nAccording to her October 2022 PSI, Applicant\u2019s credit cards and computer were \nstolen from her rental car in January 2020. (GE 7 at 2; Tr. 38-42; AE 1i). After noticing \nthat unauthorized purchases were made on her credit-card accounts, she tried to freeze \nthe accounts. Then, the COVID-19 (COVID) pandemic struck the nation in March 2020 \nand caused medical and economic paralysis. In April or May 2020, she was unable to \nobtain assistance from the credit-card companies to resolve her credit card issues. In \nJune or July 2020, the creditors for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d. 1.e, and 1.h began \ninvestigations into her credit card issues. The investigations were delayed, then \nreopened later in the summer of 2020. (GE 7 at 2) \nApplicant also indicated in her October 2022 PSI that her partner was laid off in \nearly 2020 after the onset of COVID, but she noted in her testimony that his \nemployment was actually reduced by COVID because he could not go outside to \nperform his work. (GE 7 at 2; Tr. 36) She believed that he then worked for a taxi \ncompany until the summer of 2020, when he resumed his original employment. \nApplicant received COVID monetary rental assistance of $3,000 for one month. In the \nfall of 2020, she was falling behind on her credit-card payments, and in late 2020 or \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nearly 2021, she stopped making regular payments on some listed accounts. Her credit \ncard purchases rose because she was using her credit cards for everyday purchases \nand rent. She withdrew from her retirement savings to assist in paying the bills. From \nlate 2020 to early 2021, she had her credit cards frozen and reissued. She indicated \nthat she had been in contact with the creditors to negotiate settlements, but none of the \ncreditors had responded to her with negotiated settlements through the mail, her \npreferred method of settling the credit-card accounts, because she refused to answer \nphone calls from phone numbers that she did not recognize. She was not making \npayments to any of the creditors at the time of the October 2022 PSI. Though given the \nopportunity to provide additional information to the OPM investigator about her disputes \nwith the credit accounts and the CBR, Applicant did not provide any additional \ndocumentation during or after the October 2022 PSI. (GE 7 at 2, 9; Tr. 36-38) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 This was a credit card-account opened in June 2018. The first \nmajor delinquency on the account was on February 20, 2021. As posted in the SOR, the \ncharge-off amount was $9,001. After receiving the requested documentation which \nshowed what charges belonged to her, she settled the account in September 2023. She \nindicated that she would contact the creditor and obtain a payment history. She added \nthat she made a one-time payment under a settlement agreement. Applicant \nsubsequently testified that her explanatory responses to SOR \u00b6 1.a actually applied to \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and her responses to SOR \u00b6 1.b explained her position concerning SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. (GE 5 at 6; GE 8 at 10; Tr. 46-49, 51-52) \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant filed a complaint with a federal consumer \nprotection agency on April 14, 2024 (four days after the hearing), claiming that she filed \na request for validation of the debt from the collection company in March 2024, and the \nagency did not respond to her within 30 days. She surmised that the account was \nfraudulently created during an identity theft investigation and should no longer be \npursued by the original creditor. The SOR \u00b6 1.a account was opened in June 2018, two \nyears before the June 2020 fraud investigation. (See GE 8 at 10) On April 29, 2024, the \ncollection agency who purchased the account, indicated that they terminated collection \nattempts and requested the credit bureaus remove the account from credit reports. (AE \n1: AE 1a) There is no way to assign much weight to the last page of this exhibit (moved \nto this location from AE 1i) because there is insufficient indicia of identity, such as an \naccount number or a delinquent account amount, to conclude that the exhibit represents \nadditional evidence that the Applicant is not liable for the SOR \u00b6 1.a account. (AE 1a) In \naddition, the collection agency\u2019s April 29, 2024 debt response does not indicate that she \nwas not responsible for the account. Collection efforts were probably terminated for \nother business reasons that the collection agency did not discuss in their response. \nNonetheless, the debt is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.

(GE 8 at 10; Tr. 49-52) \nIncluded in her post-hearing exhibits, there is a letter from a collection agency \nindicating that the SOR \u00b6 1.b account was satisfied on September 7, 2023. The last four \ndigits in that letter match the full account number that is posted in GE 3 at 4, GE 4 at 3, \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and AE 1b. The account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This was a line of credit that Applicant used as a safeguard for car \npayments or making payments to reduce other accounts. Another purpose of the line of \ncredit was to ensure that she had sufficient funds to pay her student loan. The account \nbecame delinquent in August 2020. She surmised that her line of credit information was \nremoved from her computer during the robbery of her computer and other credit cards \nin January 2020. When Applicant tried to negotiate a settlement, the creditor cancelled \nthe debt and sent her a federal form 1099-C, indicating that the debt was cancelled and \nshe had to include the delinquent amount as a part of her taxable income. Applicant \nindicated that she had documentation of the 1099-C though none was provided at the \nhearing.

She confirmed that position in her \npost-hearing documentation as she was trying to live within her means and not stretch \nher budget. She estimated the account would be satisfied in July or August 2024. (GE 4 \nat 3; GE 8 at 10; (Tr. 57; AE 1) This account is not resolved. \nSOR 1.h \u2013 This credit-card account was opened in August 2010, and became \ndelinquent in August 2011. Applicant believes that she paid the debt and the debt was \nremoved from her credit report. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 30, 57-58) In her October 2022 PSI, she \nstated that she had this credit-card account a long time ago and it was cancelled. (GE 7 \nat 8) Based on her claim that the debt is no longer enforceable because it is time-barred \nand no longer appears in her credit report, Applicant appears to be relying on a statute \nof limitations to support her claim that she is no longer responsible for this delinquent \ndebt. However, her reliance on the statute of limitations does not represent a good-faith \neffort to pay or settle delinquent debts. This debt has not been resolved. The total \namount of unpaid delinquent debt in the SOR is $53,259. \nApplicant earns about $9,000 a month from her two jobs. She has about \n$27,800 in a combined checking and savings account. After she pays monthly \nexpenses, including a student loan, she and her partner have a $3,500 monthly \nremainder that is transferred to savings. Applicant is accumulating her monthly \nremainders for future settlements with the listed accounts that are still delinquent. She \ntestified that she uses a budget, which she was willing to provide to the administrative \njudge. Applicant has made the following changes in managing her finances: (1) all her \naccounts have alerts to keep her apprised of the accounts\u2019 status; (2) she uses a \nbudget; and she has periodic discussions with her financial advisor and tax consultant \nsince 2021. However, she has never used financial counseling or debt consolidation \nservices. (GE 7 at 8; Tr. 59-67) No budget was provided in her post-hearing exhibits. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The \nGovernment credit reports (GE 3, 4, 5, and 8) establish that Applicant has a history of \nnot addressing financial obligations between 2011 and June 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) receives limited application to Applicant\u2019s resolution of the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e accounts totaling $55,091. On the other hand, she still owes \napproximately $53,259 to four listed creditors. These ongoing delinquent debts raise \nresidual doubts about her judgment and trustworthiness. She has provided insufficient \nor no documentary evidence of steps she has taken to resolve these four accounts. Her \nfinancial profile of earnings versus expenses, and her monthly remainder, suggests that \nshe has more money available to address her delinquent debts but has not done so. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) based on the theft of her \ncredit cards and computer from her rental car in January 2020, the health crisis caused \nby COVID in March 2020, resulting in delays in the investigation of her accounts by the \ncredit-card creditors, coupled with the freezing of those accounts, and her partner\u2019s \nreduced income from early 2020 to the summer of 2020. However, Applicant has been \ncontinuously employed since 2017. She found a second job in November 2020 to \nincrease her income. The record indicates that she could have begun to address her \naccounts by late 2021, clearly before September 2023. See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. In \nsum, the mitigation due Applicant for unanticipated events outside her control is \nundercut by her delay in being more proactive in addressing the delinquent debts before \nSeptember 2023. \nThe lack of documented evidence of financial counseling or a written budget \nreduces the applicability of the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). While Applicant \nhas resolved four delinquent debts, four debts are still not being resolved or under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to Applicant\u2019s resolution of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e, but \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h because she still owes $53,259. General \nstatements of an expectation to pay off delinquent accounts in the future do not replace \ndocumentary evidence of a pay off or a sustained track record of payments to resolve \ndebts. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been living with her partner since 2013. Sher has been employed \nby a defense contractor for the last seven years and has been employed at a second \njob since November 2020. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that all her \ndelinquent debts are being resolved or under control. Assuming that she is relying on a \nlimitations statute to avoid responsibility for the SOR \u00b6 1.h account, the debt is still \nsignificant for security clearance purposes. See ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 14, 2016) Relying on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort \nto eliminate financial debts. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a \ncase in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 1, 2007) \nWhile an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is \npaid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution and has taken \nsignificant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has resolved four accounts, but \nstill has four accounts to address.

The theft in January 2020, the COVID pandemic in March 2020, resulting in a \ndelay in having her credit instruments frozen, and causing her partner to have his work \nhours reduced, were events beyond her control, leading to her accrual of delinquent \ndebt. However, she did not take documented action on the debt delinquencies until \nmore than one and a half years later in September 2023. Though she may not have \nbeen in a financial condition to pay off or settle the debts in early 2021, she should have \nprovided documented letters or emails to her creditors of negotiated settlement efforts, \nor advising them of her financial plight, particularly after she declared in March 2022 \nthat she was in a budgeted pay schedule to pay balances or settle delinquent debts. \nAfter a full review of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been fully mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e: For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

On May \n9, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).

He received the FORM on July 21, 2023, and did \nnot respond. The case was assigned to me on November 6, 2023. Items 1 through 6 are \nadmitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.k. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in May 1988. In January \n1989, he joined the active-duty U.S. Navy and served honorably for 20 years before his \ndischarge in January 2009. (Item 3) \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant was unemployed for about a year before he found \nwork as a test specialist with a defense contractor in April 2010. He worked two years in \nthe position before he found a better position as a test surveyor with a different defense \ncontractor in April 2012. He has remained gainfully employed with his current defense \ncontractor since being hired in April 2012. In February 2022, he began working part time \nas an instructor for a local college. He previously worked parttime as a warehouse sorter, \nfrom August 2020 through July 2021. (Item 3) \nApplicant earned his associate degree in December 2019. He married for the \nsecond time in November 2020. He was previously married from 1994 through 2009. He \nhas an adult daughter, born in May 1994. He disclosed that he earns about $9,478 per \nmonth, which is about $113,700 per year. His wife earns about $28,800 per year. He \nstated he has about $3,789 per month remaining after paying his bills and related \nexpenses. He has been a homeowner since September 2021. (Items 3 and 6) \nApplicant did not disclose any financial delinquencies in his August 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA). (Item 3 at 31-32) However, in October 2022, he admitted \nhaving financial delinquencies, and discussed them during his background interview with \na DOD investigator. (Item 6 at 2) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $39,000. Applicant admitted \nall debts. He attributed his delinquent debts to his divorce in 2009. He stated that he and \nhis ex-wife informally and verbally agreed to split the debts they owed. After he learned \nthat his ex-wife was not paying the debts she allegedly agreed to pay, Applicant made no \neffort to pay them, and the debts have remained unpaid. (Item 6 at 3) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($19,118): After admitting this delinquent debt, Applicant commented \nthat he is \u201cstill responsible for the account.\u201d (Item 2 at 1) He stated that he opened the \naccount to help purchase a car for his daughter, who \u201cdefaulted on the loan in 2019.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Item 2 at 1) This debt is an individual account, which was opened in June 2013.

These debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,180): Applicant admitted this delinquent debt, explaining that this \nwas a medical bill that he reported to his insurance company for payoff.

SOR \u00b6 1.g was \nopened in 2020 and charged off in 2022. (Item 4 at 8; Item 5 at 4) SOR \u00b6 1.h was opened \nas an individual account in January 2016, with a $300 credit limit. Applicant made the last \npayment on this debt in October 2016. The debt was charged off in 2021. (Item 4 at 9; \nItem 5 at 4) Finally, SOR \u00b6 1.i was opened as an individual account.

(Item 4 at \n9; Item 5 at 6) Both debts are unresolved. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially relevant in this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in this FORM establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and ongoing. \nHis longstanding delinquent debts in this SOR remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant attributed his financial conditions to \nhis divorce in 2009. However, he has been gainfully employed since at least 2010. He \nearns over $113,000 per year, and disclosed that he has about $3,789 per month \nremaining after paying all bills and related expenses. He has been a homeowner since \n2021. He also supplements his income with part-time work; he currently works as a part \ntime instructor for a local college. He has had the financial means to address his \ndelinquent account, but for unknown reasons he has not. There is no indication he acted \nresponsibly, or that he has taken meaningful steps to substantively address his delinquent \ndebts. Though he stated he was paying off some of the debts in the SOR, he failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence in mitigation. He is credited with addressing three of the 11 \ndelinquent debts. These actions alone, however, are insufficient to fully mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has not produced evidence showing he \nhas a plan in place to repay delinquent debts and that he is adhering to the plan. He failed \nto establish he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although the record indicates Applicant disputed a \nfew debts alleged in the SOR, he did not elaborate or comment on this; nor did he present \nindependent evidence to support a reasonable basis to dispute any of the delinquent \ndebts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period of time. I am unable to find that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite \nthe presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 28, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 19, 2023, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written the record in lieu of a hearing.

There were no objections to any of the evidence \nand Items 2 through 4 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 10, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She denied the SOR \nallegation in \u00b6 1.c. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008. She married in \n2014 and has two children ages seven and four. She has worked for the same federal \ncontractor since 2006. Applicant held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI), but it is unknown when she first was granted access. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2020. \nSection 23 asked if in the past seven years she had illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstance. She answered \u201cyes.\u201d She said that from about June 2011 to the present, she \nused marijuana. She stated: \nIn the past, I\u2019ve occasionally used marijuana for recreational purposes. \nHowever, since the COVID lock down I\u2019ve started taking CBD/THC \ngummies more regularly to help ease my anxiety and insomnia. Honestly, \nthe transition to the sole caregiver of my infant and toddler has been HARD! \nI have found these help cope with being stuck in the house all day with two \ncrazy kids. Some people unwind with a glass of wine, I like to unwind with \na gummy. However, I have NEVER used marijuana during work hours or \nwhile I\u2019m working. (Item 4) \nApplicant further stated that since March 2020, she would typically take one \ngummy at 6:00 p.m. almost every day. She would occasionally smoke marijuana at night \non the weekends. She said her stress levels were \u201coff the charts\u201d being thrown into being \na full-time mother and marijuana helped her relax and sleep. She intended to continue to \nuse marijuana gummies to manage her anxiety and insomnia because of her challenging \ncircumstances \u201cbeing stuck at home 24/7, no interaction with others, having no help.\u201d She \nreiterated that she had never been under the influence at work or during working hours. \nShe disclosed she used the drug while holding a security clearance, and she intended to \ncontinue to do so. She did not report in this SCA that she believed her marijuana use was \nlegal under state law and therefore permissible. (Item 4) \nApplicant also disclosed in her September 2020 SCA that during a 2018 polygraph \nexamination, when asked about her drug use, she reported that she occasionally used \nmarijuana. She said that this information did not align with her 2018 SCA because she \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhad responded \u201cno\u201d to the question that asked if she had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances in the past seven years. She answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question on \nher 2020 SCA that asked if she ever had her security clearance eligibility/access \nauthorization denied, suspended, or revoked. Apparently, her failure to disclose her illegal \ndrug use on her 2018 SCA caused her access to SCI to be suspended or revoked but \nshe continued to hold a top secret security clearance. She said she was given a written \nletter from a senior adjudication officer but did not believe there is anything in her \nemployment record. \nApplicant completed an SCA in November 2022. Under Section 23, which asked \nif in the past seven years she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substance, she \nstated \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed her marijuana use. She provided essentially the same \ninformation about her past marijuana use except she reported her last use was in \nNovember 2022. She stated that with the COVID lockdown over, she had cut back on her \nuse to about three times a week after her children were asleep. She also continued to \nsmoke marijuana at night on the weekends. She does not drink alcohol, so she found \nmarijuana helped her relax and sleep. She reported that she continued to use it while \nholding a security clearance and that she intended to continue to use the marijuana \ngummies and occasionally smoke marijuana in the future. She stated: \u201cLiving in [State A] \nwhere marijuana is legal, I see it interchangeably with alcohol.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant reported on her November 2022 SCA the following regarding whether \nshe had received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy: \nI was read in on a government program, but it was rescinded for failing to \ndisclose the use of drugs on the updated security paperwork. I never \nreceived a written warning, and I don\u2019t believe anything was added to my \nemployee file but thought I should mention it. I\u2019m not sure if that falls under \na violation of the security policy as I still have an active TS DOD clearance. \n(Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she reiterated that she used marijuana and \nmarijuana gummies during the pandemic to cope with her children and professional \nworkload and to decompress at the end of the day. She further stated that she recently \nsubmitted her security clearance paperwork and she said she intended to continue to use \nmarijuana gummies and smoke marijuana because she was under the impression it was \nlegal to do so. She stated that after conducting an internet search she learned the use of \nmarijuana was illegal under federal law which trumped state law. She said she made a \nmistake and apologized. She stated she now will no longer use marijuana products \nbecause it is illegal and puts her security clearance at risk. (Item 2) \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any information about her \nmarijuana use from 2011 until 2016 before it was legalized in her state, while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and after her SCI access was suspended or revoked in 2018 for failing \nto disclose her prior use, which was discovered during a polygraph examination. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from 2011 through November 2022. She \nrepeatedly indicated her intent to continue using marijuana gummies and smoking \nmarijuana. It was not until she received the SOR in April 2023 that she said she would \ndiscontinue her future use. She disclosed she had been read into a government program \nand her access to SCI was rescinded because she said she failed to disclose her prior \ndrug use. There is sufficient evidence that Applicant used marijuana while she was \ngranted access to classified information. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has been using marijuana while employed by a federal contractor since \n2011. Personal marijuana use has been legal in the state where she lives since 2016. In \nher 2020 and 2022 SCA, she disclosed under the question that asked about illegal drug \nuse that she used marijuana. She did not say anything in her 2020 SCA that she believed \nher use was legal due to state law. She said she failed to disclose her illegal drug use on \nher 2018 SCA, and it was not until she was polygraphed in 2018 that the information \ncame to light. She said that her access to SCI was rescinded because she failed to \ndisclose her drug use. It is unclear why if she believed her use was legal that she would \nhave to disclose this information on her SCAs that asked to only disclose illegal drug use. \nAll these things should have been warning signs to Applicant about her conduct. \nHer access to SCI was rescinded because she failed to disclose her drug use. Minimally, \nat this point, Applicant was on notice that future drug use could be a detriment to holding \na security clearance. I do not have any evidence that she sought guidance from her \nemployer or facility security officer regarding her drug use before or after her access was \nrescinded. I have considered that she believed at some point that she was permitted to \nuse marijuana because it was legal in her state. However, she is a long-time employee \nof a federal contractor who should have known there is a zero-drug use policy and \nmarijuana use is inconsistent with her employment. She provided no explanation for why \nshe was using marijuana for years before it was legalized in her state. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s recent statement that she no longer intends to use marijuana \nin the future, she repeatedly expressed her intent to use it. Her previous conduct must be \nweighed against her recent decision. Specifically, that she was using marijuana prior to it \nbeing legalized, she reported her marijuana use as illegal, and she continued to use it \neven after her SCI access was rescinded. She did not respond to the FORM, so I do not \nhave any recent update on whether she has continued to abstain from marijuana use or \nother clarifications. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s expressed intent to abstain from drug involvement. \nHer drug use is recent and considering the frequency and lengthy period of marijuana \nuse, I am unable to find a sufficient period of abstinence has occurred and future use is \nunlikely to recur. Her conduct while holding a security clearance casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. I find AG \u00b6 \n26(b) has some application, but it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns \nraised. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to question her about his illegal drug use or evaluate his credibility \nand sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nI have a duty to exercise prudence because the protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d I am obligated to follow that directive. Applicant failed to meet her burden of \npersuasion.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline. \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant admitted owing delinquent taxes to the Federal \ngovernment for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. She testified that the total amount \nowed to the Federal government for back taxes, including penalties and interest, is about \n$30,000. She further stated that she has now filed all of her back Federal tax returns and \nbegun working on a payment arrangement with the IRS. (However, see further discussion \nunder 1.e, below.) The reason she did not file her tax returns in a timely fashion is that \nshe got scared of the consequences as time went on. As of the date of the hearing, these \ndebts have not been resolved. (Tr. 14-15, 23-25; Applicant Exhibit B at 4.) \n1.e. Applicant denied that she failed to file her 2017 Federal income tax return.\nShe stated in her Answer, \u201cI deny, 2017, I worked for 2\u00bd months and I was on medical. I \nhave filed these taxes numerous amounts of times and they were received by IRS. I only \nhad a [sic] income of about $13,000.\u201d Government Exhibit 3 contains IRS account \ntranscripts for various tax years. Regarding tax year 2017 the transcript states, \u201cWe \napologize for the inconvenience, but we are not able to process the requested tax year at \nthis time.\u201d (Government Exbibit 3 at 4.) Based on the state of the record, I cannot find \nwither that Applicant has filed this subject tax return or that she was not required to do \nso. \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2017. In fact, she admitted that she had not filed her state income tax \nreturns for approximately 18 years, through tax year 2022. She has prepared and printed \nout the returns but has not filed them. The reason she did not file her tax returns in a \ntimely fashion is that she got scared of the consequences as time went on. However, she \nalso stated that she does not believe she owes any back taxes to her state tax authority. \n(Tr. 15, 17, 23-24.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing $14,872 to a creditor for a charged-off automobile \nloan. She indicated that she is working with a credit repair agency to set up a plan to pay \nthis debt. This debt had not been paid or resolved as of the time the record closed. (Tr. \n26; Applicant Exhibit B at 4.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.h. Applicant admitted owing $11,998 to a creditor for a charged-off automobile \nloan. She stated that she still has the car, is making payments, and the amount currently \nowed is $4,900. The most recent credit reports in the record (Government Exhibit 7 and \nApplicant Exhibit D) confirm that she has been making payments and the balance on the \naccount has been significantly reduced. (Tr. 27-30.) This debt is being resolved. \n1.i. Applicant denied owing $2,284 for a collection account to a creditor. She \nsubmitted documentation showing that this debt was paid in March 2023.

A receipt from this creditor \nis not included in Applicant Exhibit C. The account does not show up in the most recent \ncredit report in the record, Applicant Exhibit D. There is insufficient evidence to show that \nthis debt has been paid or resolved. (Tr. 33.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.k. Applicant denied owing $330 for a past-due medical account. She testified that \nshe had not paid this debt. No evidence was submitted after the hearing to show that this \ndebt has been satisfied. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.l. Applicant denied owing $130 for a past-due medical account. She testified that \nshe had not paid this debt. No evidence was submitted after the hearing to show that this \ndebt has been satisfied. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.m. Applicant denied owing $70 for a past-due medical account. She testified that \nshe had paid this debt and had a receipt to support her statement. A receipt from this \ncreditor is not included in Applicant Exhibit C. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.n. Applicant denied owing $66 for a past-due medical account.

This debt is not resolved. \nApplicant testified that she had satisfied debts that are not on the SOR, but are \nincluded in her credit reports. Applicant Exhibit C contains receipts to two creditors that \nare not identified on the SOR. (Tr. 16, 30-31, 34-38.) \nApplicant admitted that she had several other delinquent debts that are not on the \nSOR. They are found in Government Exhibit 7 and Applicant Exhibit D.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant incurred approximately $59,000 in past-due indebtedness over the last \nseveral years. The debts were unresolved at the time the SOR was issued. She also \nfailed to file Federal and state tax returns for a considerable amount of time. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence establishes that none the above mitigating conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s debt situation. She has not filed any of her state tax returns. In addition, she \nhas not begun to resolve her considerable Federal tax debt. While she did show that she \nhas resolved several delinquent debts, others remain unresolved, and she did not submit \na plan to show how she intended to resolve them. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over her past-due indebtedness. Her serious financial issues are both \nlongstanding and ongoing. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been \nreduced. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to her suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h and 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j through 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He \nstopped making direct payments when he learned that he was not given credit through \nthe state child support office.

During \nthe hearing, he said he will obtain proof that the debt was paid. The record was held \nopen to allow him the opportunity to provide a receipt. He did not provide proof the debt \nwas paid. However, a May 2021 credit report lists the account as resolved. I find SOR \u00b6 \n1.h for Applicant.  (Tr. 69; Response to SOR; GE 4 at 1)   \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: a $17,299 delinquent automobile loan that was charged off: This was \na loan Applicant took out in 2015 to purchase a used car. The car broke down. It was \ntoo expensive to fix. He did not want to pay for a car that he could not use so he did not \nmake payments on the car loan even though he was responsible for the loan. He \ntestified that the debt is no longer on his credit report and he will not make payments \ntowards this debt because it is no longer collectable. The debt is unpaid. (Tr. 69-72; \nAnswer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: a $515 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant \nclaims he co-signed for cell phones for two of his fellow airmen when he was on active \nduty. His two friends got into trouble and were discharged from the Air Force. They took \nthe phones with them and did not make payments. He did not make payments towards \nthis debt. It is no longer on his credit report so he does not intend to pay it. The debt is \nunpaid. (Tr. 72; Response to SOR) \nApplicant testified that he has no other delinquent accounts. He is meeting all of \nhis current financial obligations. He has read books about managing finances and \nlearned more about financial literacy. He is more financially responsible. His previous \nfinancial problems are not reflective of who he is today. He wants to show that he has \nintegrity and can be trusted by the Government. (Tr. 19-21, 73) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided more details about his household finances. \nHis current salary is $147,900 annually, his take home pay is $4,248 every two weeks, \nor $8,496 a month. He also receives Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) disability payments. \nHis monthly payments are $2,270, a total of $27,240 annually.

(Tr. 44-49) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant disclosed he had issues with anxiety and \ndepression. He started working with a counselor at the VA in early 2022. He went to \ncounseling there for a year. He now sees a private therapist recommended by the VA. \nHe suffered from trauma in the past. Counseling and therapy have improved his \ncondition. He is learning techniques to deal with his anxiety and depression. He is not \ntaking medication. He is better equipped to deal with his responsibilities. (Tr. 51-56) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant had ten delinquent accounts, an \napproximate total of $43,998. He has a history of financial irresponsibility, to include co-\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nsigning loans and subsequently refusing to pay the loan, child support arrearages, and \nother delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While most of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent \nseveral years ago, they are still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct, and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 20217) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App.Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016) Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve his delinquent debts raised questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant encountered brief periods of \nunemployment as well as a divorce, which were conditions beyond his control. This \nmitigating condition is given less weight because he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He chose to ignore his delinquent debt. He passively waited for seven \nyears to pass so his debts fell off his credit report. This is not considered acting \nresponsibly or a reasonable effort to resolve his delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c, and 1.h. He \nprovided proof that he satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. A May 2021 credit report \nindicates the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is resolved. I cannot apply AG \u00b6 20(d) to the \nremaining SOR allegations because he failed to provide sufficient documentation to \nprove that he paid or is making regular payments towards his delinquent debts, in \nparticular his child support and arrearages. With regard to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.f, 1.i and 1.j, he intentionally waited for seven years to pass so his debts \nwould fall off his credit report and become unenforceable because of the statute of \nlimitations. Passively waiting for the debts to become unenforceable because of the \nstatute of limitations is not considered a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts. It \nremains significant for security clearance purposes. See ISCR case No. 15-02326 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) and ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 26, 2016)  \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Financial \nConsiderations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \ntimely adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant has worked \nfor the same defense contractor since 2022.

Applicant admitted in part and denied in part all three \nallegations under this paragraph with explanations. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause the conduct alleged under Paragraph 1, above, constitutes criminal activity that \ncreates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. Applicant \nadmitted in part and denied in part the single allegation under this paragraph. \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he paid for manual sexual acts at massage parlors \nabout five to ten times between approximately 2012 and 2016. \nApplicant stated that this conduct began when he was receiving massage therapy \nfor an injury to his back and ankle. When the therapist began making advances that would \nresult in sexual activity he went along with the conduct. He would go to the same massage \nparlor every few months over the period in question to engage in similar activity.

(Government Exhibits 3 and 4 at 11-15; Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 34-39, 50-\n51, 62-64, 78-83.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in December 2010 for Solicitation of \nProstitution. He denied that he was charged with the offense. \nThis incident occurred when Applicant stopped his car and began talking to a \nwoman who was an undercover police officer. What may have begun as innocent flirtation \neventually became a solicitation for prostitution. Applicant was detained by the police and \nissued a summons. The FBI identification record confirms that he was only detained. \nApplicant subsequently reported to court as ordered and found out that no charges were \nfiled. Records from the court confirm this fact. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6; Applicant \nExhibit J; Tr. 39-45, 71-78.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he paid for sexual relations with a female prostitute at \na legal brothel in Nevada in about 2009. The Government stipulated on the record that \nhis actions concerning the brothel in Nevada were not illegal under that state\u2019s law. (Tr. \n45-47, 70-71.) \nApplicant has been receiving therapy for his sexual-related issues since 2017. This \nwas after the denial of his clearance by the other agency. He stated that he began therapy \nbecause he did not want to continue to do the things he was doing. His therapist has \ndiagnosed Applicant with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic on the basis of a \nsevere childhood trauma (he almost drowned). The therapist submitted a letter on his \nbehalf stating that Applicant has been a consistent participant in treatment and has made \nprogress. She stated, \u201c[Applicant] has been observed to have made better choices to \nimprove his life by this writer.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 48-50, 83-84.) \nApplicant received an evaluation dated June 8, 2023, from a psychologist. The \nreport covered the areas alleged in the SOR. (Applicant Exhibit H.) He conducted a \nthorough examination of Applicant that included an interview, various psychological tests, \nand review of relevant documentation. The psychologist opined, \u201cIt appears he \n[Applicant] has been effective at resolving past trauma experiences and changing his \nbehavior so that the risk of inappropriate or illegal sexual activity in the future is low. His \nprognosis is currently very good.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit H at 9.) \nIn addition to therapy, Applicant also successfully completed a \u201cProstitution \nPrevention Class.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit L.) \nWith regard to all the above conduct Applicant states, \u201cI\u2019m not the same person \nthat I was then. It was very shameful. It was wrong. And I\u2019ve grown. I\u2019ve really grown since \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthen.

Applicant admitted in part and denied in part both the allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. The allegations concern Applicant\u2019s interview with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 11, 2019. \nGovernment Exhibit 4 consists of Reports of Interview (ROI) of investigative \ninterviews with Applicant conducted on May 21, 2015; November 24, 2015; September \n27, 2016; and December 11, and December 16, 2019. \nDuring the May 2015 interview with an investigator from the OPM, Applicant fully \ndisclosed the facts of his 2010 arrest for Solicitation of Prostitution. (SOR 1.b.) \n(Government Exhibit 4 at 24; Tr. 52-54.) \nDuring the November 2015 interview with an investigator from the OPM, Applicant \nagain fully disclosed the facts of his 2010 arrest for Solicitation of Prostitution. (SOR 1.b.) \n(Government Exhibit 4 at 20-21; Tr. 52-54.) \nDuring the September 2016 interview with an investigator with the other \nGovernment agency, Applicant fully disclosed the facts of his 2010 arrest for Solicitation \nof Prostitution. (SOR 1.b.) He also fully disclosed that he had attended massage parlors \nfor manual sexual stimulation five to ten times. (SOR 1.a.) He also fully disclosed his visit \nto a legal brothel in 2009. (SOR 1.c.) (Government Exhibit 4 at 12-14; Tr. 51-52.) \nAs stated, Applicant was interviewed on December 11, 2016, by an investigator \nwith OPM. According to Applicant the investigator did not ask him about the massage \nparlors, or the brothel visit, and Applicant had to bring the subject up to the investigator. \nIt is also noted that Applicant voluntarily provided the investigator with the letter of denial \nfrom the other Government agency. (Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 55-59, 85.) \n3.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that Applicant falsified facts \nduring his December 11, 2019 interview concerning how many times he had visited \nmassage parlors. According to the ROI Applicant admitted to one incident in a massage \nparlor during the December 11, 2019 interview. As stated, Applicant provided the \ninvestigator with the denial letter from the other Government agency, which completely \nset forth Applicant\u2019s conduct with massage parlors. According to the December 16, 2019 \nROI, Applicant subsequently admitted that he had not talked about the additional sexual \nactivity at massage parlors because he was ashamed. However, once again, this \nstatement by the investigator, which may or may not be a direct quotation from Applicant, \nis contradicted by the fact that the Applicant provided the letter of denial from the other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment agency.

That letter, dated February 21, 2017, stated, \n\u201cYou [Applicant] acknowledged you received happy endings after five to ten massages \nover the last three years.\u201d \n3.b. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that Applicant falsified facts \nduring the December 11, 2019 interview concerning his visit to a legal brothel in Nevada \nin 2009. After discussing his 2010 arrest the ROI stated, \u201cSubject has never been involved \nin this activity prior to or since the arrest for solicitation in Dec 10. The arrest was an \nisolated incident and not part of [a] pattern or ongoing activity.\u201d The ROI does not specify \nwhat the specific \u201cactivity\u201d was. In other words, did the interviewer, or Applicant, mean \nsoliciting women on the street for prostitution or visiting a legal brothel? Based on the \navailable evidence, I find that the allegation is too vague to find that Applicant falsified this \ninterview on this topic. \nApplicant admitted that he had not told his partner about these incidents because \nthey had agreed not to talk about the past. However, he did indicate an intent to tell her \nabout them in the near future. As set forth below, Applicant\u2019s supervisor and other co-\nworkers do have knowledge of all the incidents. Accordingly, I find Applicant has vitiated \nany possible coercion concerns. (Tr. 60, 86-90.) \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified on his behalf and provided a written \nstatement. Her evaluations of Applicant were also provided. She has been his supervisor \nfor seven years. She does not hold a security clearance, but is knowledgeable about the \nallegations in the SOR. She testified that Applicant is a person of integrity and \ntrustworthiness, that he is one of her top performers, and that she continues to have \nconfidence in him. She recommends him for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits C at 3 \nand F; Tr. 20-28.) \nLetters of recommendation were submitted by two coworkers. Each of them has \nknown Applicant for about seven years. Each of them has knowledge of the allegations \nin this case. They both state that Applicant is trustworthy and believable. They find him to \nbe a hard-working person of integrity and recommend him for a position of trust. (Applicant \nExhibits C at 1, 2.) \nAn additional letter of recommendation was submitted by a long-time friend of \nApplicant who is a healthcare client manager. She has known Applicant for 15 years. She \nstates, \u201cHis [Applicant\u2019s] character is one of a person who is caring, helpful, and \ntrustworthy.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit K.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Four are applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \nApplicant\u2019s admitted sexual behavior in 2009 (SOR 1.c.), 2010 (SOR 1.b.), and \nbetween approximately 2012 and 2016 (SOR 1.a.) is cognizable under all four of the \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden falls to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe following mitigating conditions are possibly applicable under AG \u00b6 14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAll three of the mitigating conditions have application in this case. The brothel \nincident and the attempted solicitation happened almost 14 years ago. Such conduct has \nnot been repeated. The massage parlor incidents were fully discussed with the other \nGovernment agency and with me. The last such activity occurred approximately seven \nyears ago. \nApplicant has been receiving successful treatment for all the conduct since 2017. \nThis is supported by the written statements of his therapist and the consulting \npsychologist. The chance of any recurrence is extremely low. This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAppellant was arrested for solicitation of prostitution in 2010. (SOR 1.b.) He \nattended massage parlors and received manual sexual acts between approximately 2012 \nand 2016. (SOR 1.a.) Both of the above disqualifying conditions have application to these \ntwo allegations. \nApplicant frequented a legal brothel in 2010. (SOR 1.b.) That is not a criminal act. \nAs such, it shall not be considered under this guideline. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Appellant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nBoth of the mitigating conditions have application in this case. The arrest for \nsoliciting prostitution occurred 13 years before the record closed and there has been no \nrecurrence of the conduct. The massage parlor visits ended in 2016. Since then Applicant \nhas been successfully participating in therapy and working for his current employer, as \nconfirmed by his therapist, consulting psychologist, and long-time supervisor. This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other government representative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant is alleged to have intentionally falsified material information about his \nsexual history during an interview on December 11, 2019. Any discussion of possible \nfalsification during the interview must begin with the fact that it was Applicant who \nprovided Government Exhibit 3, the denial letter from the other Government agency, to \nthe interviewer. Government Exhibit 3 sets forth in detail all the facts set forth under \nparagraph 1 of the SOR. According to Applicant the interviewer had no knowledge of the \nletter of the facts involved. Therefore the SOR allegation that somehow Applicant had \nfalsified his interview is, at the very least, contrary to the evidence. In my opinion both of \nthese allegations are not proved by even substantial evidence. \nHowever, assuming that Applicant did falsify his December 11, 2019 interview, any \nfalsification is mitigated for the following reasons. First, and most important, within days \nof the initial interview Applicant provided Government Exhibit 3 to the investigator. AG \u00b6 \n17(a) applies. \nIn addition, any alleged false statement must be weighed against Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated truthful statements to other investigators, including from the other Government \nagency, over several years. The Government was knowledgeable of Applicant\u2019s past. The \nalleged conduct, if true, was infrequent and is extremely unlikely to recur given the number \nof people at his employer who know about it. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nBased on the foregoing, Applicant has completely mitigated the Guideline E \nallegations and they are found for him. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his \nalleged sexual misconduct, associated criminal conduct, and falsification of the same \nduring interviews. He has eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. \nOverall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

At the hearing, Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5. GE 1 through GE 4 were admitted without objection. Applicant objected to GE \n5, a current credit report, because the debt totals shown did not reflect recent payments. \nThis objection was overruled.

After his overseas tour, he began looking \nfor jobs but found it harder to find employment than he expected. A friend advised him to \nstart his own business. He had good credit and was able to get a $50,000 line of credit. \nHe started his information technology (IT) cable business without proper infrastructure or \nprofessional advice on how to do it. (Tr. 30-38, 45-46, 55-56) \nApplicant started his business in 2018 or 2019, and his debts were apparently \nmounting before then. He then took a job as a defense contractor with company V, in \n2020, in the middle east on a one-year contract. He wanted to use the money he earned \nto pay down his debts. The contract was extended in 2021, but he was diagnosed with \nCOVID in January 2022. He was sent home to the United States to recuperate from \nFebruary to September 2022, as an unpaid employee. He had medical bills that set him \nback financially. He returned to the middle east in September 2022, which allowed him to \nresume addressing his debts. (Tr. 31-34, 48-49, 56-59) He also had mental health issues \nduring this period. He had a bad reaction to the medication he was given and was \nhospitalized. (GE 2) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts, all loan debts or credit-card accounts. The \ndebts total about $106,134. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are listed on credit bureau \nreports (CBRs) from August 2020 (GE 4), March 2023, (GE 3), and April 2024 (GE 5). He \nasserted in his SOR Response that he had paid off 10 other credit card accounts. He \nupdated the status of his SOR debts in an email before his hearing, with related \ndocuments. (AE A; Tr. 67-68) The current status of his SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($2,588) is a charged-off credit card account. (GE 3, GE 4) This was \nthe first debt Applicant was able to address. After he received the SOR, he arranged in \nMay 2023 to settle the account for $1,942. He made that full payment in August 2023. \n(SOR Response; AE A, AE C; Tr. 41-42, 59-60) This account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($38,431) is a loan account that has been charged off. (GE 3, GE 4, \nGE 5) Applicant took the money from this loan and invested it in the bitcoin cyber-currency \nmarket, with the hopes that it would increase in value, allowing him to fund his business \nventure. He now recognizes that this was a big mistake since this plan was wholly \nunsuccessful. (Tr. 37-41) Applicant was told that the creditor, Bank S, had sold the \naccount to debt collector Z. He said he was disputing the debt, largely on the grounds \nthat he had not received communication from debt collector Z confirming that he was \nobligated to them. (SOR Response) Applicant arranged a settlement with a different debt \ncollector firm. He is to pay $384.50 a month, beginning in April 2024 for an undetermined \ntime. (The schedule he provided is for the next 12 months but it is not clear that the debt \nwould be settled in April 2025, as no settlement amount is given).

He arranged payments of about $266 per \nmonth on this debt, beginning in September 2023 to collection agency R. (AE D; Tr. 25, \n44-45, 59-60, 63-65, 67) He said he had $1,062 left to pay at the time of the hearing (April \n2024), though an April 2024 credit report listed the account at $4,483. (GE 5) After the \nhearing, he documented that the account has been paid off in full as of April 18, 2024. \n(PH 6; PH 10) This account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,567) is a credit card account that has been charged off. (GE 3, GE \n4, GE 5) Applicant denied the debt, asserting that it was supposed to have dropped off \nhis credit report. After the hearing, he settled the debt for $1,248, and made the full \npayment in April 2024. (Tr. 67; PH 5) This debt is settled and resolved. \nApplicant noted that he has matured and learned from his mistakes. He wished he \nhad been more patient. He plans on continuing to address his debts and stabilize his \nfinances. He said he had about $16,000 in savings. He has not received financial \ncounseling. He owns no car or property in the U.S. His overseas housing is paid for by \nhis employer. He has minimal expenses. (Tr. 43-45, 68-70, 78-79, 85-86) \nApplicant was in the process of filing his 2022 and 2023 annual state and federal \nincome tax returns at the time of the hearing. He got an extension because he lives \noverseas. He attributed his failure to file his 2022 returns to the mental health issues he \naddressed in his interrogatory response. (GE 2; Tr. 69-75) After the hearing, he later \nprovided his 2022 State and Federal tax returns (PH 3a, PH 3b) and 2023 Federal return \n(PH 3c) and did not appear to owe taxes. He earned about $79,000 in 2023. (PH 3) \nApplicant received the job offer from his current employer in November 2022, at \nan hourly rate of $19.73. The offer was a 12-month contract, to be renewed in December \n2023. (PH 8; Tr. 47-48, 75-76) He estimated his 2024 income at about $103,000. (Tr. 76; \nPH 2) He is well-regarded at work.

AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern multiple past-due consumer debts \nand loans, which total over $100,000. The SOR debts are established by the credit reports \nin the record and by Applicant\u2019s testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant incurred almost $100,000 in debts after he took out loans to start a \nbusiness, without much of a plan for how to do it. He invested much of his loan proceeds \nin cyber-currency with an eye towards making money to grow his business, but then lost \nmost of his investment. Other SOR debts resulted during this period, when he also had \nonly a subsistence income. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application here since his employment \nand health instability impacted his ability to address his debts. However, as Applicant \nrecognizes, he made a very poor decision to finance his business start-up through cyber-\ncurrency investments, and without a business plan. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore does not fully \napply.  \nApplicant took a job overseas in 2021 to earn money to address his debts but spent \nmuch of 2022 back in the U.S. recuperating from COVID-19. He only began addressing \nhis debts in mid-2023. The smaller debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e are now paid and \nresolved. Although he has established a payment plan, Applicant has yet to provide proof \nof any payments for the two larger debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. These two debts \ntotal well over $90,000, and they remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He \nmakes a good salary at his job, and his income is supplemented by disability \ncompensation from the VA. However, he did not provide sufficient evidence that his debts \nare being resolved and are under control, or that he has undertaken a good-faith, \nreasonable effort to address his debts under the circumstances. Applicant did not \nestablish that any of the remaining mitigating conditions should fully apply to mitigate the \nsecurity concern shown by his delinquencies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant exercised poor financial judgment in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ntaking out large loans to finance a business and then investing that money in the cyber-\ncurrency market. This has left him with a large debt load he still has to address. He has \na history of financial difficulties. These debts will remain a security concern until he shows \na documented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve them. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

The \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) determined that it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information, and on \nAugust 8, 2023, it sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct). The DoD acted under Executive Order (Exec.

On April 29, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor May 23, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant did not submit Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) at the hearing. I kept the record open, and he submitted AE A, a personal \nstatement, addressing each SOR allegation and his efforts to obtain a statement from a \nhealthcare provider. AE A was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 4, 2024. \nI took administrative notice of the definition of nolle prosequi as defined by the \napplicable state statute and that \u201cnolle prossed\u201d or a dismissal means no conviction.

On the night in question Applicant had been \ndrinking with his former spouse earlier in the evening and had gone to sleep at his \ngirlfriend\u2019s (GF1) apartment. He was awakened when GF1 tossed water on him. (Tr. at \n29; GE 11; GE 12.) He described the incident as follows: \nI jumped up out the bed because I'm asleep, startled, and I grabbed the \nposts of the bed and -- to walk around. And then when I did that, that's when \nthe post fell. And then the mattress fell on my foot. And then I threw -- I just \nthrew the mattress off my foot. Didn't hit her.

So I came back, and then that's when the police was there. (Tr. at \n29.) \nThe incident occurred around midnight. The police were inside the apartment when \nhe returned. He described himself as calm when he returned. He could not recall if the \npolice questioned him but acknowledged the police probably had questioned him. The \npolice reported \"[Applicant] arrived back on scene, irate and banging on her apartment \ndoor.\" (Tr. at 41; GE 10 at 4.) The police listed the bedframe and two televisions as \ndamaged in their report. (GE 10 at 2.) He told the police he did not know how the items \ngot destroyed and denied the allegations. (GE 10 at 4; Tr. at 42.) He was taken into \ncustody. (Tr. at 43.) He was not represented at court and accepted the plea deal offered \nby the prosecutor because he had destroyed the property. (Tr. at 44.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. In September 2021 Applicant was arrested and charged with \nAssault and Battery Against a Family Member. An Emergency Protective Order \n(Family Abuse) was entered him following the incident. The assault charged was \nnolle prossed in January 2022. Applicant and his girlfriend at the time (GF2) got into an \nargument. Both individuals had been drinking. (Tr. at 48-49.) He testified GF2 called a \nfriend and said, \u201cI got my friend on the phone.\u201d He described his response as: \nSo yeah. I grabbed -- then I -- and she put the phone in my face. I was like, \nman. Then I grabbed the phone. I threw it on the bed. And then when I threw \nit on the bed, that's when I walked out the door. (Tr. at 52.) \nHe denied putting hands on GF2 but said he might have \u201cbrushed up against her \nto walk out\u201d because she was standing in front of the doorway when he left. (Tr. at 53.) \nHe denied spitting in GF2\u2019s face. He denied that shoved her against the headboard and \ngrabbed her arm and her throat. (Tr. at 54.) He admitted dumped soap in a sink. He \ndenied saying \u201cI hope you die tonight.\u201d (Tr. at 67; GE 3 at 7 (The police presumably \ninserted this page in this document as part of their investigation of SOR \u00b6 1.a.)) He \nacknowledged the police report\u2019s description of the apartment being in disarray because \na bag of corks had broken open. He stated when he was packing his \u201cstuff out of the \nkitchen, the bag hit the wall\u201d and \u201cwhen the bag hit the wall, the corks fell down.\u201d (Tr. at \n55.) GF2\u2019s son was in the home at the time of the incident. (GE 8 at 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. In March 2022 Applicant was and charged with (1) Assault and (2) \nIntentional Destruction of Property. An Emergency Protective Order (Family Abuse) \nwas issued against him following the incident. In about June 2022, he pled guilty \nto Intentional Destruction of Property and was sentenced to 12-months \n(suspended) conditioned on one year of good behavior, keeping the peace, \nobeying the court's order, and paying fines and costs. The assault charge was nolle \nprossed. Applicant went to GF2\u2019s apartment to collect his things after they had broken \nup. (Tr. at 62.) He got into an argument with GF2, who was in her car. He was described \nby a witness as very aggressive, screaming and getting the face of GF2.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. Applicant\u2019s arrests reflect a \npattern of unlawful and disruptive conduct since 2017 going through 2022. The incidents \ndid not occur under such unusual circumstances to make recurrence unlikely. I conclude \nthat the instances of misconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c are not mitigated by the \npassage of time. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Insufficient time has passed to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior will not recur once the pressure of regaining his security \nclearance is lifted. He has completed the terms imposed by the court, but he has not \ndemonstrated rehabilitation by a sufficient the passage of time without recurrence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. I have considered that Applicant served honorably \nunder combat conditions in the U.S. Navy. I have considered his efforts to overcome his \ncombative tendencies during confrontations. I have concerns about his less than full \ncandor regarding the circumstances of his multiple criminal offenses. \u201cOnce a concern \narises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).
