His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old acquisition analyst employed by a defense contractor. He served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1967 to 1969, and is a Vietnam War Veteran. He married his first wife in 1980 and was divorced in 1987. He married his current spouse in July 2000, and they have been separated since May 2005. She filed for divorce in 2008, and they are going through an acrimonious divorce. He has four adult children from other relationships who live independently (Tr. 47). In June 1995, Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in business management. He completed his master\u2019s degree in business administration in June 1997 (GE 1). Applicant testified he had access to classified information at the secret level from 1982 to 1987. He then had confidential access for a few years until 2004, while working for another government agency and a government contractor (Tr. 62). He has not had access to classified information since 2004. 1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made ",

Moreover, he falsified his security clearance application. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 3, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86). On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 18, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on May 7, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 19, \n2009. Because of scheduling considerations, it was reassigned to me on May 27, 2009. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 25, 2009. The government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 7, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non July 7, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h through 1.n. He \ndenied the remaining SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old acquisition analyst employed by a defense contractor. \nHe served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1967 to 1969, and is a Vietnam War \nVeteran. He married his first wife in 1980 and was divorced in 1987. He married his \ncurrent spouse in July 2000, and they have been separated since May 2005. She filed \nfor divorce in 2008, and they are going through an acrimonious divorce. He has four \nadult children from other relationships who live independently (Tr. 47).  \n \nIn June 1995, Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in business management. \nHe completed his master\u2019s degree in business administration in June 1997 (GE 1). \nApplicant testified he had access to classified information at the secret level from 1982 \nto 1987. He then had confidential access for a few years until 2004, while working for \nanother government agency and a government contractor (Tr. 62). He has not had \naccess to classified information since 2004. \n \n \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since April 1997, except for brief \nperiods of unemployment from May to November 2003 (when he received \nunemployment benefits), and after being fired from two jobs in March and October \n2005. He was underemployed from February to July 2007, when he held two temporary \njobs before obtaining his current position in October 2007.  \n \nApplicant attributed his current financial problems to three main causes: his \nperiods of unemployment and/or underemployment; his acrimonious separation and \ndivorce, and being overwhelmed by his marital and financial problems (Tr. 168). After \nhis marital separation, Applicant did not care anymore about himself or about being \nresponsible to his creditors (Tr. 168). He stopped paying his legal obligations. \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant was hired by his current employer. He started earning \napproximately $5,000 a month. He claimed that since then, he has been trying to \ncorrect his financial situation by paying his taxes, school loan, and other creditors. He \naverred he is doing everything he can do under his circumstances to pay his creditors. \n \nIn his May 2007, security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having \nfinancial problems (being over 90 days delinquent on some of his debts) because of a \nperiod of unemployment. His background investigation addressed his financial status \nand included the review of May 2007, September 2008, and February 2009 credit \nbureau reports (CBRs), his responses to DOHA interrogatories in 2008 and 2009, and \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $139,000, which have been delinquent for a number of years. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g (all small \nmedical bills likely for Applicant\u2019s failure to make a copayment), claiming that: he was \nunaware of these debts; he was not sent notice that the debts were in collection; and he \ndid not know who the collector is.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce papers were filed in September 2008. Applicant is contesting \nlegal responsibility for all the medical bills outlined above because he believes they are \nhis wife\u2019s medical expenses (AE 3). During his testimony, Applicant claimed his attorney \ntold him not to pay any debts until the divorce court adjudicates responsibility for the \ndebts. He later qualified this statement by saying that his attorney only told him not to \npay the medical bills. He presented no documentary evidence to corroborate his claim. \n \nAdditionally, he is contesting responsibility for the two delinquent mortgages \nalleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p (two different real estate properties). One of the \nproperties has been owned by Applicant\u2019s spouse since 1998. However, Applicant and \nhis spouse refinanced the mortgage together. This property was foreclosed. Applicant \ndoes not know whether he owes money as a result of the foreclosure. Applicant testified \nhe was a co-signer on both mortgage loans. Thus, he is jointly responsible for both \nmortgage debts. He presented no evidence to show he was released from his legal \nobligations with respect to these mortgages.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nConcerning the remaining SOR \u00b6 1 allegations, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.h, are his debts, and have been delinquent for a number of years. Applicant \ntestified that his debts became delinquent because of his poor financial management \nand negligence in keeping up with his bills (Tr. 154-165). He explained that he makes \npayments to some of his creditors whenever he has money, but his financial situation \ndoes not allow him to pay all of his debts.  \n \nApplicant started making sporadic payments on some of his delinquent debts \naround January 2009, and continued until April 2009 (AE 7). There is no record \nevidence of any effort to settle, pay, or resolve any of his delinquent debts prior to \nJanuary 2009, or after April 2009. Applicant presented no documentation showing he \nhad paid, properly disputed, or made any efforts to contact his creditors in an attempt to \nresolve any of his other debts. Applicant never contacted his creditors to resolve his \nfinancial obligations because he was overwhelmed by his personal problems and the \nattorney fees related to his divorce. Applicant is not aware of what is required of him to \nshow that he is reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. \n \nApplicant considered filing for bankruptcy around May 2009; however, he never \nfollowed through with it. He is waiting for the divorce court to divide the marital assets to \ndetermine which debts are his responsibility. He averred numerous times that he is \nwilling to pay those debts that are determined by the court to be his legal obligations. \nApplicant has not participated in any financial counseling and has no budget in place. \n \nI find that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g are contested medical debts. I further \nfind that the remaining SOR debts are Applicant\u2019s debts as established by the admitted \nCBRs, his answers to the interrogatories, and his testimony at the hearing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2007, security clearance application required him to make a \ndetailed disclosure of all his employment activities during the last seven years (Section \n11); to disclose whether he had been fired from a job (Section 22); and to disclose any \nforeign travel (Section 18). Applicant deliberately omitted two periods of employment. \nThe first from December 2004 to March 2005 with company A, and then from August \n2005 to October 2005 with company B. Moreover, Applicant failed to disclose that he \nhad been fired from both company A and company B, and that he had traveled \noverseas as part of his employment with both companies. \n \nApplicant vehemently denied his omissions were deliberate or with the intent to \nmislead. He initially testified he never knew he had been fired, and that he was never \ngiven a reason for his termination (Tr. 29). He testified he is an honest and trustworthy \nperson, and that he had no reason to lie. During the later part of his testimony, Applicant \nadmitted that in October 2005, while overseas performing on a contract his company \nhad with the government, he was told to take the first flight back to the United States. \nShortly thereafter, his supervisor in the United States called him overseas to ask him \nwhy he was fired. Applicant claimed he was never informed of the reasons why he was \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfired. Nevertheless, Applicant testified he was told by his U.S. supervisor that he was no \nlonger working for the company, and to take the next plane home (Tr. 180-183). \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s claims that his omissions were an innocent oversight not to be \ncredible. Applicant is a well-educated and mature person with experience working for \nthe government and government contractors. He knew or should have known that he \nwas terminated from both jobs under adverse circumstances. Furthermore, his \ncontradictory testimony shows his omissions were not an oversight. I find Applicant\u2019s \nomissions were deliberate and made with the intent to mislead.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented character statements from two supervisors. \nApplicant is considered to be a valued employee. He has established a reputation for \nproviding first-class service to his clients. His witnesses believe him to be a responsible, \ndedicated, and honest person. Both references recommended Applicant receive access \nto classified information.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He claimed that he was \noverwhelmed by his financial and personal problems and deliberately ignored his \nfinancial obligations. After starting his current job, he claimed he has been making \nefforts to resolve his financial problems. He presented little documentary evidence of \nsuch efforts.  \n \nApplicant highlighted that he is a Vietnam War Veteran, and that he has served \nthe U.S. government well in prior jobs, and in his current position. He believes that his \nfinancial problems do not make him a security risk or concern. There is no evidence that \nApplicant ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d2 Once the \ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. I conclude that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g are \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontested medical debts. The remaining SOR debts are Applicant\u2019s debts as \nestablished by the admitted CBRs, his answers to the interrogatories, and his testimony \nat the hearing.  \n \nOther than the above mentioned medical bills and the payments Applicant made \nfrom January to April 2009, he presented little documentary evidence that he has paid, \nsettled, or properly disputed any of the alleged debts. Nor did he present documentary \nevidence of efforts to resolve his financial obligations. It is not clear from his testimony \nwhether Applicant has the financial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, \nand his day-to-day living expenses. Moreover, in the recent past, Applicant\u2019s personal \nand financial problems overwhelmed him to the point that he was no longer interested in \naddressing his legal obligations. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \nand AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his \ninability to pay his debts, i.e., his periods of unemployment and underemployment, and \nhis contentious separation and divorce. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but does not \nfully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. He presented little evidence of debt \npayments, contacts with creditors, and settlement or negotiations to resolve his SOR \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndebts. Because of his failure to address even his small SOR debts, I also find he is not \nfinancially responsible. Considering the evidence as a whole, his financial problems are \nnot under control. He has not participated in financial counseling, and he does not seem \nto have a viable financial plan to resolve his financial predicament or to avoid similar \nfinancial problems in the future. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not yet under control. He also failed to show he made good-faith efforts to resolve \nhis debts. His actions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.  \n \n \nDespite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations concerns are \nnot mitigated. Applicant has not demonstrated his financial responsibility by taking \nsufficient actions to resolve his debts.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security/trustworthiness concern \nstating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his security clearance application \nwhen he failed to disclose that he had been employed by two different companies within \nthe last seven years, that he left his employment from both companies under adverse \ncircumstances, and that he travelled overseas while employed by those companies. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, job experience, and \nhis contradictory explanations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions create security concerns under two disqualifying conditions. \nHis behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none are fully established \nby the record evidence. Applicant falsified his security clearance application. It was not \nuntil after he was confronted that he admitted his omissions. His falsification is a serious \noffense (felony), it is recent, and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n10 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a Vietnam War Veteran. \nHe is a mature and well-educated man. He is considered to be a valuable employee \nwho is dependable, reliable, and trustworthy. He believes that his financial problems do \nnot make him a security risk or concern. There is no evidence he has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for his financial mistakes and promised to pay his creditors. He \nestablished some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his inability to \npay his debts. These factors show some responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He presented little documentary evidence of debt \npayments, contacts with creditors, and settlement or negotiations of debts. Applicant \nhas been employed since 1997, except for the previously mentioned periods of \nunemployment from May 2003 to November 2003, and in March 2005 and October \n2005. Applicant is undergoing an acrimonious divorce and his personal and financial \nsituation has overwhelmed him. Instead of showing financial responsibility and \njudgment, he deliberately ignored his financial obligations. His recent efforts to resolve \nhis debts are not sufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. His \nfinancial problems are not under control. He has not participated in financial counseling \nand he does not seem to have a viable plan to avoid similar financial problems in the \nfuture. Moreover, Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f,   \n \n \n \n   and 1g: \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.h - 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn June 30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following factual findings: Applicant is 42 years old and is an employee\nof a Defense contractor.  Applicant is married, and he and his wife have two children, ages 13 and\n14.  Applicant had an extra-marital affair with an old friend between late 2003 and late 2004, and\nat that time he fathered a child who was born in January 2005.  No one is aware of the affair and the\npaternity of the child except the mother of the child, although Applicant is listed as the child\u2019s father\non the birth certificate.  Applicant sees the child monthly and makes a $1,000 cash deposit in the\nchild\u2019s mother\u2019s bank account monthly to cover child care expenses. At present, there is no formal\nagreement governing child support, although Applicant agrees that the child\u2019s mother could seek a\ncourt order or other formal agreement for additional support in the future.  Applicant does not want\nhis wife to learn of the affair and is convinced that she would divorce him if she learned of it.\nApplicant\u2019s wife was unaware of the clearance hearing, because Applicant had the papers related to\nthe case mailed to his mother\u2019s address.  Applicant did not present any evidence regarding his job\nperformance.  \nApplicant admitted the allegations against him, and those admissions were sufficient to\nestablish the government\u2019s case against him.  The burden of proof then shifted to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the case against him.  Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.15.    \nApplicant argues that he should have been granted a clearance because he demonstrated\nhonesty and trustworthiness by revealing his affair and his illegitimate child.  He states that the\ngovernment probably would not have become aware of the affair and the child if he had not\nmentioned them.  While the Judge stated that Applicant was subject to coercion because of the affair\nand the child, Applicant maintains that he revealed the information to the government to \u201cmitigate\nthe possibility for bribery or coersion (sic).\u201d  \nApplicant testified at the hearing regarding his honesty in revealing his affair, and he stated\nthat he would not compromise the interests of the United States.  That was mitigating evidence for\nthe Judge to consider, and there is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered it unless he\nspecifically stated otherwise.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\n\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008). \nMost of the testimony at Applicant\u2019s hearing involved the fact that his wife was unaware of\nhis affair and the existence of his young son.  While Applicant revealed the affair and his young child\nto the government, his wife remained unaware of them at the time of the hearing, and Applicant had\nused his mother\u2019s address when corresponding with the government about his clearance.  The\nJudge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s lack of knowledge was a continuing security concern\nand that Applicant remained vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress in that regard are\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR by undated statement, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 29 April 2008, and I convened a hearing 29 May 2008.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 5 June 2008. \nJune 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 42-year-old systems\nadministrator employed by a defense contractor since April 1995. He seeks to retain the\nsecurity clearance he has held since July 1996.\nBetween late 2003 and late 2004, Applicant had an extra-marital affair, during\nwhich he fathered a child. His paramour bore Applicant a son in January 2005. Only his\nparamour is aware of the affair and the paternity of her child. Applicant\u2019s spouse is not\naware of either the affair or the child. Applicant has two other children with his wife,\nages 13 and 14.\nApplicant\u2019s paramour was a woman he met in college in 1983, with whom he\nthen had a brief relationship. They have remained friends over the years, and continue\nto be friends. The affair began when Applicant and his wife were contemplating divorce.\nThey agreed to remain together \u201cfor the sake of their children.\u201d Applicant and his\nparamour agree that the affair was a mistake.\nApplicant acknowledges paternity of his paramour\u2019s son, and is listed as the\nfather on the child\u2019s birth certificate. He sees his son at least monthly. There is no\nformal court order or written agreement governing current or future child support.\nHowever, Applicant pays his paramour $1,000 per month (cash deposited to her\naccount) to cover child-care expenses. He acknowledges that he could be liable for\nadditional child support in the future, but has not given the issue much thought.\nApplicant remains concerned that his wife might learn of the affair, as she would\nalmost certainly divorce him immediately. Indeed, his wife is not aware of his clearance\nhearing, because he had the case papers mailed to his mother\u2019s house to keep his wife\nfrom learning about his hearing. He did not present any evidence relating to his job\nperformance.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against\nApplicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the\nevidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n3\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ; (e) personal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing . . .;\n3\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against granting\naccess to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. In most circumstances, Applicant\u2019s\naffair and fathering a child out of wedlock would raise few security concerns. However,\nhis concealment of those facts from his wife, his desire to continue that concealment,\nand his active steps taken to continue that concealment\u2014through concealing the fact of\nhis clearance hearing\u2014demonstrates his potential vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.  He has taken no steps to reduce that vulnerability. Further, the\n3\nrecord contains no information upon which I could base a whole person analysis in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n4\nSubparagraph c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

In her answer to the SOR, she \npresented evidence that the four student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.x \nwere no longer delinquent, leaving 22 delinquent debts totaling $32,244. Of these 22 \ndebts, 10 are for medical expenses. Applicant was diagnosed as epileptic in 2002, and \nmost of the medical expenses were incurred for treatment while she did not have \nmedical insurance (Tr. 30). Applicant testified she believes the medical debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are the same debt, but she did not provide any documentation to \nsupport her belief (Tr. 50). Applicant applied for a grant to pay the hospital bill alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, but the paperwork was lost and she did not follow up. She admitted she \n\u201cdropped the ball\u201d in resolving this debt (Tr. 49). \n \n \nApplicant moved from the west coast to the northeastern U.S. in December 2002 \nat her own expense, to pursue a personal relationship (Tr. 37). In June 2003, six \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmonths after her move, she was laid off (Tr. 29-30). She immediately found other \nemployment, but she quit her job in September 2003 because of a disagreement over \nher eligibility for overtime pay (Tr. 38). She was unemployed until January 2004 and \ncould not draw unemployment benefits because she had voluntarily left her job (Tr. 40). \nAfter January 2004, she was employed steadily until March 2006 when she was \nterminated because of a disagreement with her district manager over the scope of her \nauthority (Tr. 43). After a break of about four weeks, she began working for her current \nemployer (Tr. 44).  \n \n \nApplicant has a domestic partner, and she pays most of her partner\u2019s living \nexpenses, including her partner\u2019s car insurance (GX 6 at 3). Her partner has elected to \nprovide unpaid child care for her grandchildren instead of working outside the home (Tr. \n54). \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount\nStatus at Hearing \nEvidence \n1.b \nMedical \n$1,682 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1; GX 5 \n1.c \nMedical \n$2,067 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.d \nMedical \n$276 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.e \nMedical \n$768 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.f \nMedical \n$282 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.g \nMedical \n$408 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.h \nMedical \n$273 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.i \nMedical \n$330 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 1 \n1.j \nCredit card \n$1,511 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.k \nCredit card \n$1,091 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.l \nCredit card \n$659 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.m \nCollection \n$748 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.n \nCollection \n$5,737 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.o \nCar repossession \n$12,607 Unpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.p \nCable box \n$262 \nDisputed, no proof \nGX 4 at 10 \n1.q \nCredit card \n$334 \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.r \nCell phone \n$138 \nDisputed, no proof \nGX 4 at 14 \n1.s \nMedical \n$1,128 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at Encl 1 \n1.t \nMedical \n$999 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 15 \n1.u \nStudent loan \n$3,228 \nCurrent \nEnclosure to answer \n1.v \nStudent loan \n$4,748 \nCurrent \nEnclosure to answer \n1.w \nStudent loan \n$3,576 \nCurrent \nEnclosure to answer \n1.x \nStudent loan \n$1,065 \nCurrent \nEnclosure to answer \n1.y \nCredit card \n$3,864 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 6 \n1.z \nCollection \n$168 \nDisputed, no proof \nGX 4 at 18 \n1.aa \nTraffic ticket \n$627 \nGovernment conceded \nTr. 104 \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay at her current job is about $2,600 (Tr. 69). \nShe testified she lives paycheck to paycheck (Tr. 55). She is paying $50 per month \nmore than is required on her student loans, but is not making payments on any other \ndelinquent debts. She has no active credit card accounts (Tr. 73). She drives an eight-\nyear-old car that she paid for with an income tax refund (Tr. 71-72). She has not \nparticipated in any financial counseling (Tr. 76). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant has numerous debts that are currently delinquent, and \nher marginal financial situation makes continued or further delinquencies likely. At \npresent, she lives from paycheck to paycheck, with virtually nothing in reserve for \nunexpected expenses.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy in January 1998 was the result of a domestic breakup, a \ncircumstance beyond her control, and it was a reasonable response to her financial \nsituation. Applicant\u2019s medical bills were circumstances beyond her control, but in \nseveral instances her lack of medical insurance was due to her voluntary decision to \nquit a job or change jobs. Her unemployment from September 2003 to January 2004 \nwas not a circumstance beyond her control, because it was the result of her decision to \nquit her job. Her four-week period of unemployment in 2006 was a circumstance beyond \nher control, but many of the debts were already delinquent at the time. Although \nApplicant has been employed steadily for more than two years, she has done virtually \nnothing to settle or pay her debts, except for her student loans. She has not sought \nprofessional help. She admitted at the hearing that she \u201cdropped the ball\u201d on an \nopportunity for a grant that would have covered her largest medical debt. I conclude that \nthe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought financial \ncounseling.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nWith the exception of her student loans, Applicant has done virtually nothing to resolve \nher debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nasserted at the hearing that she disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.r, and 1.z, \nbut she provided no documentation, either at the hearing or during the period the record \nwas kept open after the hearing. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent woman. She was sincere, open, and credible at the \nhearing. Unfortunately, she has been unwilling or unable to take a systematic, \naggressive, disciplined approach to her financial situation. Except for her student loans, \nshe has done virtually nothing to resolve her delinquent debts. She brought no \ndocumentation to the hearing, even though she had been questioned repeatedly about \nher financial situation before the hearing and knew that her debts raised security \nconcerns. She presented no evidence after the hearing even though the record was \nkept open at her request.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.t: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.x: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.y-1.z: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Terry L. Elling, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 20, 2006.\nOn April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on June 6, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 30, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-8), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE A-G), which were received without objection. I left\nthe record open until July 30, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional documentation.\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n2\nHe submitted a post hearing submission (31 pages) marked (AE) H. The record closed\non July 30, 2008. DOHA received the transcript on July 9, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe record, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 23, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e- 1.g, of the SOR. He denied the other allegations in the SOR\nbecause he had no knowledge of them. He provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior employee of a defense contractor. He received\nhis undergraduate degree in 1968 and his master\u2019s degree in 1977. He has worked for\nhis current employer since December 2005 (GE 1). Applicant served in the United\nStates Army from 1968 until 1988 when he retired. He held a top secret clearance\nthroughout his military and defense contractor career (Tr.39).\nAfter his retirement from the military, Applicant worked for several government\ncontractors. In 1999, he began working for the Joint Forces Command. He remained in\nthat position until 2005. He has had a distinguished career.\nApplicant married in August 1971 and has two grown children from that marriage.\nHis wife opened a day school operation related to a church. When Applicant and his\nwife moved in 1992, she took over a school operation that was not in the best financial\nshape (Tr. 54). In 1993-94, Applicant and his wife decided to expand the day care\nprogram (Tr. 55). In 1996, they designed a building through a contractor and took out\nloans for a second operation. The school did not sustain the paying student population\nafter a few years. In 1999, the school was losing money. Applicant could not get another\nloan and he put some of his own money into the school to help pay the expenses. He\npaid approximately $100,000 of his own money toward the school business (Tr. 60).\nApplicant paid the required federal payroll taxes and the state worker\u2019 compensation\npremiums. He had an accounting firm handle the tax filings and payroll administration.\nEventually, Applicant and his wife, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 1999 (GE 1).\nApplicant claimed he filed the petition to protect the property for the builder who filed\nclaims on the property. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the amount of $200,000 in October\n1999, to protect his personal assets in conjunction with the business legal action.\nApplicant explained he filed the bankruptcy not because he could not pay any debt or\npersonal loan, but rather to protect him from \u201csome unscrupulous persons who sought\nto claim the property that he and his wife had developed for the school business.\u201d The\nIRS as a creditor filed an objection to the Chapter 13 plan. The reason for the objection\nwas based on a tax claim in the amount of $90,490.84 for unpaid pre-petition tax\n\nApplicant received IRS notices about tax liability for tax years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The IRS held\n1\npersonal tax refunds for Applicant until 2004. He estimates the total amount retained by the IRS was\napproximately $20,500.\n3\nliabilities.  Applicant and his wife wanted to pay $500 monthly to the trustee. The IRS\n1\nobjected because the plan did not provide for the full payment of the priority tax claims.\nThe Petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed by the Court in 2001 for failure to\nconvert to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (GE 7).\nIn October 2001, Applicant learned that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was\ndismissed (Tr. 66). He believed that the taxes/debts were part of the bankruptcy\npetitions. He had made contributions to the plan in the amount of $ 24,650.  Applicant\nbelieves he did not see the trustee\u2019s report until the security clearance investigation\nbegan in 2007. He acknowledged at the hearing that he should have been more diligent\nwith this matter in 2001. \nIn 2005, Applicant received a notice from the IRS concerning taxes that he had\nnot paid from the school business. He contacted them to clarify the issue. Applicant\nretained legal counsel to investigate the matter. He paid $6,750 in legal fees. He\nlearned that he owed taxes from the 1990's from the school business. At the same time,\nthe IRS levied Applicant\u2019s accounts, and garnished his wages for a tax levy in the\namount of $1,668.00 per pay period\nIn 2005, there was a reduction in government contract work.  In September of\n2005, Applicant lost his employment. Thus, he could not pay the tax amount in a lump\nsum. He completed an offer in compromise form (656) (AE E). Applicant claimed that\nIRS called him back and said that the debt was not collectible because he was not\nworking (Tr. 75). In 2006, Applicant learned that he also owed state taxes on his 2003\npersonal tax due to a deduction that he had taken for a business loss that turned out not\nto be valid (Tr. 73).\nIn August 2007, the IRS garnished Applicant\u2019s wages (AE E). The amount\ngarnished is about $43,000 total. As of May 2008, the IRS is still garnishing Applicant\u2019s\nwages but he is not sure why or how the payments are applied.\nThe SOR alleges an unpaid federal tax lien, six unpaid state tax liens and a\nbankruptcy in 1999. The total amount of the unpaid debts is approximately $50,000 (GE\n7). \nSOR allegation 1.a is for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed on October 12, 1999 and\ndismissed in March 2001 for failure to convert to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, per court\norder. Applicant claimed he was not aware that the Chapter 13 was dismissed. He then\nstated that his attorney notified him in late 2001 that the Chapter 13 was dismissed but\nnot for a specific reason.\nSOR 1.b is a federal tax lien in the amount of $32,641.00. This has been satisfied\nand the lien released on June 27, 2008 (AE H).\n\n4\nSOR 1.c-1.g are for unpaid state tax liens from 1995 until 1999 (GE 7) for a total\nof approximately $10,100. Applicant contacted the state in 2008. He resolved these\nstate tax liens after the hearing. The state agreed to reduce the amounts owed and did\nnot require Applicant to pay all the penalties and interest. Total of liens was reduced\nfrom $14,469 to $9,220. He is paying a monthly amount of $786.14 (AE H). \nSOR allegation 1.h is for $7,700 for an unpaid lien for worker\u2019s compensation tax.\nApplicant learned about this when the security investigation started in 2008 by viewing\nhis credit report. He contacted the agency and learned it had been expunged. The lien\nhas been satisfied (AE H). \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $8,700 (GE 8). His wife is not working\ndue to a medical condition (AE G). After monthly expenses and current debt payments,\nhe has a net remainder of $1,000. Applicant\u2019s credit card debt is current. He has an\nestablished budget. He has savings in his pension account of approximately $305,800.\nHe lists total assets as $683,600. (GE 8)\nApplicant earned three citations while in the military in Vietnam. He received an\nAir Medal (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n5\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has unpaid debt to the IRS in the amount of $32,641 and\nfive state tax liens from 1999. He could not meet his financial obligations from the\nschool failure. He filed for bankruptcy in 1999. AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond\none\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative\ncash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries started in 1995 but continue until the present day.  Because\nof his dedicated recent efforts to establish financial responsibility, it is unlikely that the\nfinancial difficulties will recur or that there is any doubt about his current reliability or\ngood judgment. This potentially mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems initially arose from the failed school business. However, he was not\nvigilant with the situation concerning his bankruptcy and his taxes. He also had a few\nbrief periods of unemployment. He acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these\ndebts very recently. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This applies. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies\nwhere the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received counseling when he filed for\nbankruptcy. This is a legitimate means to resolve financial difficulties. In this case many\nof the financial problems were caused by the failed school business. He has satisfied\nthe state liens and has a payment plan for the other debt. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition partially applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant had his wages\ngarnished for a period of time. He is still attempting to ascertain the reason why the\nwages are being garnished. He has been paying the IRS and they have not told him\nwhere the garnished amount is applies. This mitigating condition partially applies in this\ncase.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has served in the military and in the private\ndefense industry with a top secret security clearance for more than 40 years. He has\nnever had any misconduct or issues with a security clearance. He served his country\nand he helped his wife to operate a school venture.\nThe venture failed and financial problems arose from that business failure.\nApplicant could have been more proactive after the filing and dismissal of the\nbankruptcy in 2001.  He has paid the federal tax lien and the state tax liens. He is in\nrepayment status with the other debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86 e-QIP), on\nFebruary 14, 2007. On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines E and H. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 7, 2008. He submitted a\nwritten response to the SOR allegations on October 27, 2008, and requested a decision\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on January 27, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary 3, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a written response\non March 2, 2009, which is included in the record. DOHA assigned this case to me on\nMarch 12, 2009. The government submitted 12 exhibits, which have been marked as\nItems 1-12 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been\nmarked and admitted as Item 3.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 27, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, and 2.a-2.b of the SOR. In his response to the FORM,\nApplicant denies an intent to misled.\nApplicant, who is 23 years old, works as an engineer technician for a Department\nof Defense contractor. He began his employment two years ago. Applicant attended\ncollege, but did not graduate. He worked part-time in the school year and full-time in the\nsummer. Applicant has two young children. (Item 4; Response to FORM)\nAs a freshman college student, Applicant attended parties where marijuana was\navailable. In May 2005, he smoked, \u201cone puff\u201d, of a marijuana cigarette. He did not like\nthe effect marijuana had on him. He decided not to smoke it again, and has not. He\nrecognized that marijuana use could get him in trouble. (Item 5; Response to Form) \nIn college, Applicant had friends who smoked marijuana. When he attended their\nparties, he abstained from smoking marijuana. In December 2006, Applicant drove\nthree friends and himself to a movie. On the way to the movie, one friend smoked\nmarijuana in his car with his knowledge. After the movie, he and his friends purchased\nbeer to take to a party. Two beers were consumed immediately. Applicant then drove to\nthe party. The police stopped him because he was driving 20 miles m.p.h. over the\nspeed limit. After approaching the car, the police officer smelled marijuana and\nobserved beer in the car. Applicant and his friends were asked to step out of the car and\nto sit on the sidewalk. The police searched Applicant\u2019s car and found a bag of marijuana\nin the console. (Item 8; Response to FORM)\nDuring the course of the arrest, one of Applicant\u2019s friends acknowledged that the\nmarijuana belonged to him. However, because Applicant and his friends first denied the\nexistence of the marijuana, the police arrested all four. The police charged all four with\npossession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and open container in\nvehicle. The police also charged Applicant with speed greater than reasonable and\n\n3\nprudent. The police charged two friends with underage drinking and one of these friends\nwith possession of a suspended license. (Item 8)\nApplicant and the prosecutor agreed to a deferred prosecution on the charges\nfiled against him in December 2006 upon the condition Applicant did not commit any\ncrimes and pay a $200 fine. As part of the agreement, the prosecutor dismissed the\ncase against Applicant in January 2007. The one friend who admitted to ownership of\nthe marijuana was sentenced on the possession of marijuana charge only. The\nprosecutor did not proceed against the remaining two friends in his car in December\n2006. After this incident, Applicant decided to change his behavior. He has no future\nintent to use drugs or smoke marijuana. (Item 9; Response to FORM)\nBetween October 2006 and July 2007, Applicant received six traffic violations,\nincluding the December 2006 stop.  Four of the six traffic violations involved speeding.\nHe received three speeding tickets in July 2007. Applicant states that he thought it\nwould be \u201cmanly\u201d to drive fast to impress his friends. He eventually learned that the\n\u201conly thing speeding accomplished was me [him] paying fines and [his] my friends\nboycotting riding with me since it was dangerous\u201d. He now realizes the dangers of\nspeeding. Since the birth of his children, he recognizes how important it is to follow the\nrules of the road and does. (Items 10, 11, 12; Response to FORM) \nThe traffic charge on July 16, 2007 included a charge for operating in violation of\nrestriction. Applicant\u2019s glasses broke earlier in the day. He drove home without his\nglasses. He pled guilty to both charges and paid the fine of $308. (Item 11; Response to\nFORM)\nWhen he completed his SF-86, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the following\nquestion:\nSection 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, which ever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics \n(opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.),\namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question because he did not consider a single\npuff of marijuana in 2005 substantial enough to be reported as use. Applicant listed his\narrest for possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia when asked about\nhis criminal record. His other answers on the SF-86 are detailed and complete. He\nacknowledged his one time use of marijuana as a college student in his response to\ninterrogatories. His answer is the source of the information in allegation 2.a. \n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n1\n\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

Jun. 9, 2004)).\n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n. . .\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(A) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24 a about one time use of marijuana. This information is\nmaterial to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and\nto his honesty. In his response to the FORM, he denies, however, that he had an intent\nto hide information about his one time use of marijuana. When a falsification allegation\nis controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to\n2\napply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or\nfalsification in his answer was deliberate.\nWhen he completed his SF-86 and e-QIP, Applicant listed his criminal arrest for\npossession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia, but did not acknowledge that\nhe used marijuana. He tried marijuana once while a college student, a fact he admitted\nin his answers to interrogatories. His failure to acknowledge his one time use or \u201cpuff\u201d of\nmarijuana is not dispositive because his listed his arrest for possession of marijuana\n\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n3\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n7\nand possession of paraphernalia. By admitting his arrest for drug possession, Applicant\nput the government on notice that marijuana use may be an issue in this case. When\nasked about his use of marijuana in interrogatories, he readily acknowledged his very\nlimited use of marijuana. He has been honest in responding to all requests for\ninformation. His actions show he had no intention of concealing his very limited drug\nuse. Allegation 1.g under Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.3\nApplicant\u2019s five traffic tickets in nine months is sufficient to establish a rules\nviolation under AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). Mitigation may be established under AG \u00b6 17 (c) \u201cthe\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d or (d) \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\nApplicant has not received a speeding ticket in 21 months. As he grew older, he\nlearned the cost to him for his driving was not only financial, but the loss of trust from\nfriends. With the birth of his children, he fully realizes the dangers of his bad driving.\nThese factors influenced a change in his attitude, his lifestyle and driving behavior. He\nfollows the rules of the road as he does not want to harm his children or others. There is\nlittle likelihood that he will repeat his poor driving patterns. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n\n8\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nApplicant acknowledges one use of marijuana in 2005 and his arrest in 2006 for\npossession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia. These incidents are sufficient\nto establish the above disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 26 by\nshowing that:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation;\nApplicant smoked marijuana once as a college student. Because he did not like\nthe effect of the marijuana on him, he decided against smoking it in the future. His one\ntime use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\nAfter being arrested for his friend\u2019s drug conduct, Applicant decided he needed to\nchange the direction of his life. He did not want to be involved with the police and drugs.\nIt has been more than two years since his arrest and nearly three years since he\nexperimented with marijuana. He has no intent to smoke marijuana in the future. He\ndoes not want to set a bad example for his children. Applicant\u2019s past minimal drug use\nis not a security concern as he has changed his focus in life to his family and\ncompliance with laws. Guideline H is found in favor of Applicant.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination of\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern.     \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nproblems occurred two to three years ago and have not reoccurred. Applicant is only 23\nyears old, but he has grown up in the last two years. He is now the father of two young\nchildren. He recognizes his responsibility to his children and wants to set a good\nexample for them. He has learned from his mistakes of a few years ago. He has\nchanged his attitude and his behavior. There is little likelihood that he will ever\nexperiment with drugs in the future. He understands now that it is important to follow the\nrules of the road and of society. He has done so for almost two years. Applicant\u2019s has\ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy and honest.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct\nand drug involvement. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged Applicant owed approximately $38,713 for nine delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of these allegations. The government also alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c that he deliberately falsified his answers to financial questions 28.a, 28.b and 27.d in his e-QIP. In response thereto, Applicant admitted that he answered as alleged but denied that he did so intending to falsify the information requested. Accordingly, his responses to \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c are entered as denials. Finally, the government alleged that Applicant lost his driver\u2019s license in 2006 as a result of a judgment entered against him in favor of an insurance company (SOR \u00b6 2.d); that his wages are being garnished by the state where he lives to satisfy a delinquent child support account (SOR \u00b6 2.e); that he left a job in September 2006 under adverse circumstances (SOR 2.f); and that he was convicted in December 2005 of an arrest in May 2005 for driving while intoxicated (DWI) (SOR \u00b6 2.g). In addition to the facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.

After reviewing the results of\nApplicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. On May 30, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\n(SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. On November 10, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on November 20, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response to\nthe FORM. He did not timely respond to the FORM by the December 20, 2008,\ndeadline. The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $38,713 for nine\ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nall of these allegations. The government also alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c that he\ndeliberately falsified his answers to financial questions 28.a, 28.b and 27.d in his e-QIP.\nIn response thereto, Applicant admitted that he answered as alleged but denied that he\ndid so intending to falsify the information requested. Accordingly, his responses to \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a, 2.b, and 2.c are entered as denials. Finally, the government alleged that Applicant\nlost his driver\u2019s license in 2006 as a result of a judgment entered against him in favor of\nan insurance company (SOR \u00b6 2.d); that his wages are being garnished by the state\nwhere he lives to satisfy a delinquent child support account (SOR \u00b6 2.e); that he left a\njob in September 2006 under adverse circumstances (SOR 2.f); and that he was\nconvicted in December 2005 of an arrest in May 2005 for driving while intoxicated (DWI)\n(SOR \u00b6 2.g). In addition to the facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 29-year-old high school graduate with some college course work to\nhis credit. He has never been married but is the father by different mothers of two\nchildren, ages nine and eight, for whom he is obligated to pay monthly child support. In\n2004, Applicant incurred a $17,000 arrearage in support for his older child. He appeared\nin court and, by court order, his pay has been garnished at a rate of $252 each month.\nThe balance on this debt is currently $15,556. (FORM, Item 4)\nIn 1998, Applicant was sued by an insurance company representing a party to a\ntraffic accident Applicant was involved in. A judgment subsequently entered against him\nfor $21,068 remains unpaid. Applicant claims he first became aware of the judgment in\n2006, when, after a traffic stop, his license was revoked because of the judgment. He\nhas not taken any action to resolve the judgment and it is unclear if he has recouped his\ndriving privileges. (FORM, Items 4 and 5)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nApplicant also owes approximately $2,089 for seven other delinquencies. One of\nhis debts is for a $220 civil judgment against him which he has not paid. According to a\ncredit report, the judgment was entered in August 2000 (FORM, Item 7), but Applicant\nclaims to have no knowledge of the judgment or the underlying debt. There is no other\navailable information about this debt. (Answer to SOR; FORM, Item 4) The remaining\ndebts are delinquent consumer accounts dating back to 2001. One of the debts (SOR \u00b6\n1.I) is for a telephone account he obtained for his mother, who was supposed to make\nthe payments. When he was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2007 as\npart of his background investigation, Applicant provided personal financial information\nthat showed he had more than $1,000 left each month after expenses. By his own\nadmission, Applicant\u2019s debts are the result of immaturity and poor money management.\n(FORM, Items 4 and 7)\nIn 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI while driving on or near a\nmilitary installation. He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to one year of\nsupervised probation and ordered to attend alcohol safety and awareness counseling.\n(FORM, Items 3 and 9) In 2006, Applicant left a job he had held for five years. He left by\nmutual agreement with his employer because his attendance was unsatisfactory.\n(FORM, Item 3)\nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in June 2007, he disclosed the wage\ngarnishment for his child support arrearage, the end of his 2006 employment, and his\nDWI conviction. He also listed only one of his delinquent debts and did not list either of\nthe civil judgments against him. (FORM, Item 3) In response to the SOR allegations of\ndeliberate falsification, he claimed he thought he did not have to list judgments more\nthan seven years old and that he did not remember his other debts or details about\nthem.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E- Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial\nconsiderations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as addressed in AG\u00b6\n15, is that:\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n5\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant denied the allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c) that he deliberately falsified\nhis answers to e-QIP questions about his finances. Thus, it was the government\u2019s\nburden to prove he acted with the requisite intent to falsify or mislead. (Directive,\nE3.1.14) Applicant\u2019s discrepant e-QIP answers were not discussed during his subject\ninterview with a government investigator. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant disclosed one\ndelinquent debt in response to question 28.a. He also disclosed his wage garnishment\nfor his child support debt. His claims that he could not remember details about other\ndelinquent debts he owed is plausible, as is his contention that he thought he did not\nhave to disclose judgments greater than seven years old. Had he not disclosed other\nadverse financial information in his background, or if he had concealed adverse\ninformation about other facets of his background, I might reach a different conclusion.\nHowever, having considered all of the available information about his apparent intent\nwhen he submitted his e-QIP, I am satisfied he did not intend to falsify his answers to\nhis e-QIP as alleged. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a , 2.b and 2.c are resolved for the Applicant.\nAs to the remaining allegations, the government\u2019s information is sufficient to\nshow that he lost his driver\u2019s license as a result of the civil judgment after his 1998\naccident (SOR \u00b6 2.d) and that his wages are being garnished to satisfy his child support\narrearage (SOR \u00b6 2.e). However, these allegations merely plead facts related to and in\nsupport of the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, respectively. As such, they are not\npotentially disqualifying in and of themselves. Accordingly, I conclude SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and\n2.e for the Applicant.\nAvailable information also supports the allegations that Applicant left his job in\n2006 by mutual agreement with his employer because of unacceptable attendance\n(SOR \u00b6 2.f), and that he was arrested and convicted of DWI in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.g). These\nfacts require consideration of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as\na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information). In response, Applicant has not presented any\ninformation to show that these events should no longer undermine confidence in his\njudgment or willingness to abide by rules and regulations. In light of all of the\ninformation about his personal conduct, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns about his personal conduct. \nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n6\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in the\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i. Further, Applicant admitted he owes more than $38,700 for nine\ndelinquent debts. He has not acted voluntarily to resolve any of the debts, some of\nwhich have been due for more than seven years. Further, Applicant earns enough\nmoney to pay or otherwise resolve seven of the nine delinquencies, which average less\nthan $300 each. Applicant admits he incurred his debts through irresponsibility and\nimmaturity. Accordingly, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19(b)\n(indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any\nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant did not present sufficient information to support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20. His debts are recent and\nongoing. Despite having the means to take action to resolve at least some of his more\nmodest debts, he has failed to act in any meaningful way to improve his financial\ncondition. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the government\u2019s\nadverse information about his finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 29 years\nold and presumed to be a mature adult. However, the great weight of the information\npresented shows he has failed to meet his personal, professional and paternal\nobligations over much of his adult life. There is no positive information in this record\nabout any facet of his background. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all\n8\navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances and personal conduct shows he\nhas failed to addressed satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his ability or\nwillingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the\nnational interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of the government.9\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f - 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \nI have carefully reviewed the administrative file, pleadings, and exhibits in this \ncase and conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under the \nFinancial Considerations adjudicative guideline. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on \nJune 11, 2007. On May 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n1 \n \nOctober 15, 2008\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \n \nOn June 25, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing.   She requested that \nher case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled \nits File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 14, 2008. The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated August 18, 2008, a copy of \nthe Form was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections with 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on \nAugust 27, 2008.  She timely filed a response.  Department Counsel did not object to \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and I have admitted it to the record of this case. The \ncase was assigned to me for a decision on September 26, 2008. \n  \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by revising \u00b6 1.d. \nto read as follows: \u201cYou are indebted to [a creditor] on an account that has been placed \nfor collections with [a collection agent] in the approximate amount of $287.00.  As of \nMay 8, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\u201d1 In her response to the FORM, Applicant did \nnot object to the Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR and observed that the \nproposed amendment reflected the true amount of the debt. (Response to FORM at 1.) \nAccordingly, I granted the Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was responsible for eight financial delinquencies. \n(Item 1.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four factual allegations and \ndenied four factual allegations. She also provided additional information to support her \nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position. (Item 2.)  In her response to the FORM, \nApplicant admitted the additional factual allegation in revised \u00b61.d of the SOR. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and the mother of a young child. She is \nemployed by a government contractor as a claims associate.  (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college with a bachelor of science degree in 1997.  On \nher SF-85, she did not list employment for the period 1997 to 1999.  From October 1999 \nto November 2004, Applicant was steadily employed as a customer service \nrepresentative and a customer service trainer. From November 2004 to February 2006, \nshe was unemployed.  On her SF-85, she indicated she was unemployed because she \nwas pregnant. In May 2006, Applicant accepted a position with a government \ncontractor. In May 2008, her employer let her go in a reduction in force. She was rehired \napproximately six weeks later in mid-June 2008. (Item 4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM \nat 1.)  \n \n \n \n1 The SOR originally read: \u201cYou are indebted to [a creditor] on an account that has been placed for \ncollections with [a collection agent] in the approximate amount of $1,387.00.  As of May 8, 2008, this  \ndebt had not been paid.\u201d \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \n   \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. The SOR identified \napproximately $55,456 in delinquent debt.  Applicant admitted owing listed debts \ntotaling $54,249. (Item 2; Response to FORM.) \n \nApplicant followed bad advice and failed to file her federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2001 and 2003.  In 2005, a tax lien of $15,352 was filed against her. In an \ninterview with an authorized investigator in September 2007, Applicant admitted the \ndebt.  She reported she had negotiated a payment schedule with the Internal Revenue \nService and was making payments of $40 per month.  She also reported that the \nbalance on the federal tax lien had grown to approximately $18,000. In her response to \nDOHA financial interrogatories, Applicant reported that her 2006 and 2007 federal \nincome tax refunds had been applied to the debt.  She failed to provide documentation \nto corroborate that her refunds had been applied to her federal tax debt or that she was \nconsistently making monthly payments on the tax debt. (SOR \u00b61.a; Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n In her response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation showing a \nwage garnishment every two weeks of $76.23 for a state tax delinquency for tax year \n2004 and a wage garnishment every two weeks of $78.14 for a state tax delinquency for \ntax year 2003. The state tax delinquencies were not alleged on the SOR.  (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM.) \n \nIn 1992, Applicant took out loans to finance her higher education.  Her loan \npayments were $285 per month.  After she graduated from college in 1997, Applicant \nwas able to find only low-paying jobs that permitted her to support her basic needs, and \nshe became delinquent in repaying her education loans.  In about 1999, she received \nnotice that her education loans were in collection status.  She was unable to reach a \npayment agreement with the creditor, but she made some payments of $100 to the \ncreditor when she had additional money available. As of May 2008, the student loan \ndebt totaled approximately $31,197 and had not been satisfied.2  (SOR \u00b61.h; Item 2; \nItem 4; Item 6.) \n \nIn July 2008, Applicant entered a program to rehabilitate her student loan \naccount, and she agreed to make nine monthly payments of $300. In July 2008, she \nmade one payment of $300.  She stated that she intended to make another payment at \nthe end of September 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.)  \n \nApplicant admitted she owed the following additional debts alleged in the SOR: a \n$463 debt in collection status (SOR \u00b61.c); a $287 debt in collection status to a \ncommunications creditor (SOR revised \u00b61.d); and a charged-off unpaid automobile debt \nof $7,237 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  The Government also alleged in the SOR that Applicant owed \nthe following debts: a medical debt of $135 (SOR \u00b61.b); a debt of $212 on a charged off \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and a debt of $573 on a charged off account (SOR \u00b61.f). The \nbasis for the Government\u2019s allegations was Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 8, 2008.  \n \n2 In an attachment to Item 6, Applicant provided a statement, dated February 2008, from the student loan \ncreditor showing her education debt to consist of $27,086.38 in principal, $3,904.26 in interest, and \n$7,437.75 in fees, for a total debt of $38,428.39. \n\n4 \n \nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.e, and 1.f.  In the face of \nApplicant\u2019s denial, the medical debt alleged at \u00b61.b is not sufficiently identified on her \ncredit report to establish prima facie that she owed the debt.  However, the debts \nalleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f. are identified on the credit report with specific account \nnumbers and, as business records, establish prima facie that she owed the debts. \nApplicant provided no documentation to corroborate her denial that the debts were not \nhers. Accordingly, the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant, and the \nallegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are concluded against her.  (Item 1; Item 8.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer appreciates her competence and leadership abilities. \n(Response to FORM.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband had a recurrence of a health problem and lost his job in \nNovember 2007.  Applicant intends to find a part-time job to help with family living \nexpenses.  She has no savings.  She earns approximately $10 per hour at her present \njob. After paying her fixed expenses each month, Applicant has a deficit of $166.70.   \nShe has not met with a credit counselor.  (Item 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n5 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated considerable delinquent debt and \nwas unable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \n\n6 \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose in about 1997, when she graduated from \ncollege and earned insufficient income to repay her student loan debts. She did not list \nemployment between 1997 and 1999. Even though she held steady employment \nbetween 1999 and 2004, she continued to accumulate debt.  She failed to file her \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2001 and 2003. A federal tax lien was filed \nagainst her in 2005.  Her student loan debt and her federal tax lien remain unresolved.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financially delinquent behavior occurred several years ago, it remains \nunresolved at the present time, is likely to recur, and casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b620(a) \ndoes not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from her early post-college under-employment and \nher husband\u2019s recent unemployment and medical problems. Applicant admitted financial \ndelinquencies that spanned an eleven year period, from 1997 to 2008. Her husband\u2019s \nunemployment and health problems occurred recently in November 2007. During a \nsubstantial part of the time she had financial delinquencies, Applicant was steadily \nemployed. While her early underemployment and her husband\u2019s unemployment and \nhealth problems were beyond her control, Applicant offered no explanation for her \nfailure to resolve or settle her financial delinquencies over a period of many years when \nshe was employed. I conclude that she failed to act responsibly in identifying and \nresolving her substantial debts. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part as a factor for \nconsideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. While she has \nrecently worked out a payment plan for her delinquent student loans and has made \nsome payments to satisfy her federal tax lien, her current monthly budget shows a \ndeficit of approximately $166, making consistent payments unlikely. Accordingly, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 20 (c) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. Her good-faith \nefforts to pay or resolve her delinquent debts, however, even though impracticable, \nmerit the partial application of AG \u00b620 (d).  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a young woman, recently graduated from college. She failed to pay her \ncollege student loans and did not file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2001 \nand 2003. She was steadily employed between 1999 and 2004.  After the birth of her \nchild, she returned to the workforce in 2006. She has encountered unfortunate hardship \nand setbacks. However, despite a steady income for several years, she failed to budget \nher resources to satisfy her many debts, which now total over $54,000. She has failed \nto demonstrate that her financial problems will not continue to be security concerns in \nthe future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOver the years, Applicant engaged in a number of questionable activities,\nincluding surfing the Internet for pornography on his work computer and falsifying the\namount of time worked on a government contract. This raises security concerns that he\nfailed to mitigate. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nE, Personal Conduct, and Guideline M, Use of Information Technology. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nJune 30, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 7, 2009, admitting the allegations set forth\nin SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g, and denying the remainder. Also, he\nrequested an administrative determination instead of a hearing. Applicant filed a\nsupplemental answer on May 8, 2009. On January 4, 2010, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received the file on February 2,\n2010, and provided a three-page reply on March 3, 2010. On April 12, 2010, the case\nwas assigned to me.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with two teenage children. He earned a\nbachelor of science degree in 1989 and has been working as an engineer for the same\ncompany since 1998. \nIn 1989, Applicant\u2019s car was burglarized. Applicant filed an insurance claim to\nreceive cash reimbursement for several personal belongings that were stolen. His\nfather, who was the insurance policy holder, told him to list personal items on the claim\nthat were not actually in the car when the burglary occurred. Applicant complied, and\nthe insurance company ultimately paid his father approximately $1,800 more than he\nwould have collected had Applicant filed an accurate claim. Because Applicant was not\nthe insurance policy holder, he did not receive any of the money from the claim. (Item 8\nat 3)\nIn 1997, Applicant, while backing his car out of a parking space, struck the\nbumper of another parked car, causing what he estimated to be approximately $1,500\nof damage to the other car. The car was not occupied. Applicant left the scene of the\naccident without leaving any contact information with the car owner. (Item 8 at 4) \nIn 2001, Applicant, while backing his car out of a parking space, struck the\nbumper of another car. Although he may have possibly scratched the other car\u2019s\nbumper, Applicant drove away without either checking for damage to the car or leaving\nany contact information. (Id.)\nBetween 1998 and 2006, Applicant spent approximately 10 to 20 minutes each\nday viewing pornography on his company-issued computer. Company policy prohibited\nemployees from uploading, downloading, creating, distributing or otherwise transmitting\nsexually explicit materials. (Item 10 at 6) In 2003, Applicant signed a statement\ncertifying that he had read this policy and understood it. (Id. at 2) \nFrom 2003 to 2006, Applicant worked on a government contract. During this\ntime, he sometimes billed the government agency for time he spent  \u201cgoof[ing] off with\ncoworkers, surfing the Internet, and playing video games\u201d instead of working on the\ncontract. (Item 7 at 2)  Some of the time, Applicant inappropriately billed to the\ngovernment contract time he spent looking at pornography on the company-issued\ncomputer. (Item 7 at 3) \n\n3\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant overbilled the Government $50,000 in this\nmanner. Applicant admits he had frequent periods of down time, but contends he never\noverbilled the Government. Specifically, he asserts that his maintenance of the\nGovernment agency\u2019s information technology system sometimes involved menial tasks\nrequiring minimal effort. Consequently, Applicant had frequent periods of \u201cdown time.\u201d\n(Item 6 at 3) The periods when he was entertaining himself instead of working on the\nproject occurred during these periods. He would always \u201cmake up\u201d the time by working\nextra hours. (Id.; Item 2 at 2) \nThe basis of the Government\u2019s contention that Applicant overbilled a government\ncontract $50,000 derives from an interview that a polygrapher conducted with the\nApplicant. (Item 9) Applicant admits telling the polygrapher that he goofed off on the job\n\u201ca couple of hours a week,\u201d but contends that the polygrapher erroneously inferred that\n\u201ca couple of hours a week\u201d for the length of the contract totalled 20 hours a week, each\nweek for eight years. (Item 6 at 3) Also, the report of information that the polygrapher\nprepared omitted Applicant\u2019s contention that he always made up the time by working\nextra hours. (Item 6)\nIn the 12 years Applicant has worked for his employer, his charges to various\ncontracts have never been questioned. (Item 3 at 2) I find that Applicant engaged in\nsome overbilling, but that it was less than the Government alleged. The exact amount\noverbilled is inconclusive.\nOver the years, Applicant has occasionally driven his car after drinking too much\nalcohol. (Item 9 at 3) The last time he drank too much alcohol before driving was in\n2006. He has neither been stopped nor arrested for drunk driving. (Id.) \nAnother Government agency conducted an investigation into Applicant\u2019s conduct\nin 2006. It denied Applicant access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in\n2006.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions that are used to evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. This process involves the scrutiny of the following\nvariables :\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n4\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThis process of considering these variables when evaluating an applicant\u2019s security-\nclearance worthiness is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant has engaged in several episodes of misconduct\nincluding time card fraud, viewing pornography on a work-issued computer, and driving\nwhile under the influence of alcohol. AG \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any\nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d applies. \nIn assessing the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct, I did not assign as much\nweight to the 1989 false insurance claim allegation, set forth in SOR subparagraph 1.a,\nas I did to the other allegations. Applicant was 23 years old at the time and listed under\nhis father\u2019s policy. Also, he falsified the claim based upon his father\u2019s instruction, and\ndid not receive any money from filing the false claim. AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies to SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s other misconduct. He did\nnot overbill the Government as much money as the SOR alleged. However, his\ncontention that he engaged in no overbilling is not plausible given his history of\ndishonesty demonstrated by leaving the scene of two accidents between 1997 and\n2001. \n\n5\nApplicant has not engaged in any episodes of misconduct in four years. The\npassage of time is outweighed by the severity of the conduct. I was particularly troubled\nby the work-related nature of some of his misconduct, particularly the Government\ncontract fraud.  The significance of this transgression was not lessened by the fact that\nhe did not defraud the Government of as much money as the SOR alleged. Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct security concern.\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nApplicant viewed pornography on a work-issued computer approximately ten\nminutes per day from 1998 to 2006. From 2003 to 2006, he engaged in this activity\nknowing that it was against company policy. This conduct triggers the concern listed\nunder Guideline M, as follows:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question\nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks,\nand information.\nIn particular, the disqualifying condition listed in AG \u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a\ngovernment or other information technology system,\u201d is applicable.\nApplicant has not engaged in this conduct in four years. Given this passage of\ntime, I conclude that AG \u00b6 41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior\nhappened . . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of information technology, when considered alone, no longer\ngenerates a security concern under Guideline M. However, this does not lessen the\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s computer-related misconduct when considered together with\nhis other personal misconduct, as evaluated in the Personal Conduct section, above. \nWhole-Person Concept\nI have considered the whole-person factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) in my analysis of\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines. My conclusion that Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns remains unchanged. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esq. Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Applications (SCAs) on June 8, 2007.\nOn March 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug use (Guideline H),\nand personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on March 26, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 28, 2008, and the hearing was held on August 12, 2008. At the\nhearing, two exhibits (GE 1 and GE 2) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and offered three exhibits. (AE A\nthrough AE C) Department DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript on August\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n2\n19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRulings on Procedure\nAttached to Applicant\u2019s one page is three-page attachment that chronicles his\ndrug history. This document is being admitted in evidence as AE D, sworn to on March\n26, 2008, the same day as Applicant\u2019s answer.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains two allegations under the drug involvement guideline, and one\nallegation under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations.\nApplicant is 19 years old, single, with no children. Applicant is a co-op (work-\nstudy) student at a local university. As a co-op student, Applicant is employed by the\nuniversity in alternating semesters to work on classified projects that the university\nresearch institute has with various user agencies such as the United States Air Force\n(USAF). Applicant should receive his degree in computer science in 2009. He seeks a\nsecurity clearance. \nDrug Involvement\nSome time in December 2006, Applicant was 17 years old and at home on\nChristmas holiday break from his first year at the university. His friend (two years older\nthan he) came to his home and offered him marijuana. Applicant had known this\nindividual for six years, and did not consider ingesting marijuana to be anything\nsignificant, particularly after hearing the friend minimize the drug\u2019s effect. Applicant used\nthe drug briefly and found the drug made him loose and happy. \nOn December 28 or December 29, 2006, Applicant was at home when his friend\noffered him some marijuana. In the company of a third person, they smoked marijuana\nin a pipe. \nIn May 2007, Applicant was hired by the research institute of the university. In\nJune 2007, after speaking with his supervisor who told him to tell the truth, Applicant\ncompleted his security clearance questionnaire (SCA, GE 1) and disclosed his drug use\nin December 2006 as required. (Tr. 13-15) \nAt home during summer break (July 4, 2007) from the university, Applicant (age\n18) used marijuana a third time (Tr. 28) with his friend. They used marijuana (from a\npipe) during a two-hour car ride in the friend\u2019s car. He liked the sensations he felt from\nusing the marijuana. (Tr. 21) Later in July, Applicant learned he had been denied an\ninterim clearance by his current employer. \n\n3\nSome time later in July 2008, Applicant talked with the security officer and his\nsupervisor about his previous drug use. He also advised his parents and girlfriend.\nApplicant  expressed to his family and friends that he would not let drugs be a part of his\nlife. (Tr. 16) While he still sees his friend (with whom Applicant used drugs on three\nprevious occasions) on an irregular basis, Applicant has never used drugs with him\nagain. (Tr. 16) Applicant attributes his marijuana use to underestimating the long-term\nconsequences of drug use on health and getting a job where a security clearance is\nrequired. (Tr. 37; AE D) \nPersonal Conduct\nAfter completing his SCA on June 8, 2007, Applicant used marijuana in July\n2007. Then, he was notified that his interim security clearance had been denied based\non his drug use in December 2006. \nCharacter Evidence\nAn official was on the interview team that investigated Applicant\u2019s employment\nqualifications in January 2007. The official was impressed with Applicant\u2019s character\nand his technical background. In July 2007, the official became Applicant\u2019s supervisor.\nIn the performance period of January to May 2008, Applicant received an outstanding\nperformance rating based on his positive contributions in improving the user interfaces\nfor the core business codes. (Tr. 44) Even though his supervisor is aware Applicant\nused marijuana, he still recommends him for a position of trust. Applicant has a very\ngood grade average at the university. As noted, his performance evaluation is very\nrespectable. Applicant volunteered for a drug test in August 2008; the results were\nnegative. (AE A)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Where\nthere is reasonable doubt concerning persons to be considered for classified\n\n4\ninformation, that doubt must be resolved in favor of national security. I have drawn only\nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in\nthe record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation\nor conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement (DI) \n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 24\nApplicant used marijuana twice in December 2006 and once in July 2007. Even\nthough he never harvested the drug, purchased the drug or sold the drug, his conduct is\ndisqualifying under the drug involvement (DI) guideline. DI disqualifying condition (DC)\n25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 24.c. (illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia) apply.\nDI mitigating condition (MC) 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nprovides limited mitigation in Applicant\u2019s case. While he used the drug twice in\nDecember 2006, and once in July 2007, his use was infrequent. Applicant fully realizes\nhe made a mistake by misjudging the seriousness of drug use on his chances of\nreceiving a security clearance. The drug use occurred during Applicant\u2019s late teenage\nyears. The experimental drug use does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability\n\n5\nas observed by his supervisor. See, AE C. Though Applicant meets only one of the\nelements of DI MC 26.b. (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs are used, (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence, and a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation), he has convinced me that his education and career are too important to\njeopardize by continuing to use drugs. Applicant understands that distancing himself\nfrom drug users and situations where drugs are used is an important way for him keep\ndrugs out of his future. I find for Applicant under the DI guideline. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d AG \u00b6 15\nPC DC 16. c. (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information) applies. Using marijuana after\nexecuting a SCA demonstrates poor judgment under PC DC 16.c. because the\napplicant is essentially showing by his conduct that he is against the DoD drug policy. If\nhe is willing to defy the law by using drugs regardless of the amount or time of use, then\nthere is a fairly good chance he may apply the same sort of attitude toward security\nrules he chooses not to follow. The government does not have to take this risk. \nApplicant exercised good judgment by informing his parents and girlfriend in July\n2007 about his drug use and his decision not to use drugs again. His good judgment\nextends to October 2007 when he informed the government in that he had used\nmarijuana in July 2007. Applicant\u2019s experimental drug use in December 2006 and July\n2007 is mitigated by his disclosure actions and solid character evidence. The evidence\npresented under PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or\nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) supports an ultimate finding in Applicant\u2019s favor under the PC\nguideline.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\n\n6\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nWhen Applicant first used marijuana in December 2006, he was 17 years old, a\ncritical time in Applicant\u2019s teenage life where he, like most teenagers, is exposed to peer\npressure by friends who are about the same age. History tells us that peer pressure\nunder these circumstances dominated by idle time usually leads to frolics that involve\nthe wrong side of law. If they have not already done so, teenagers confront some\ndegree of pressure to use drugs. Unfortunately, Applicant yielded to the pressure on\nthree occasions. \nApplicant should not have smoked the marijuana. Yet, after he was denied an\ninterim clearance for his drug use in December 2006, Applicant used drugs on a third\noccasion in July 2007. Clearly, there are obvious reasons Applicant should not have\nused the drug after being denied the interim security clearance. Fortunately, Applicant\ntold his family and friends, and embarked upon a path that reinforces his decision not to\nuse drugs in the future. I believe he warrants another opportunity to make evident his\nsecurity worthiness. This conclusion is based on his documented honesty, his forthright\ndisclosures, and his compelling character evidence from his university transcript and his\nsupervisor. The DI and PC guidelines are resolved in his favor.   \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 15, 2008, and requested a \nhearing. DOHA initially assigned the case to another administrative judge and \nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nreassigned it to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 15, 2008, \nand the case was heard on July 29, 2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. At the \nconclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until August 14, 2008, to give Applicant \nan opportunity to submit information. On August 19, 2008, Applicant submitted four \nexhibits that I marked as AE A through D, and admitted into the record without objection \nby the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript on August 15, 2008.                                     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three factual allegations \ncontained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and married. He has three children, ages 21, 18 and 11. \nHe has a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration and has been a Certified Public \nAccountant since 1981.  \n \n \nFrom June 1981 to January 2000, Applicant was a partner in an accounting firm.  \nHe left the partnership to begin making arrangements to purchase a steel company that \nhad three separate locations. In July 2000, he acquired the company, after obtaining a \n$5 million dollar loan from a bank that he secured with company assets and his \npersonal guarantee. (Tr. 14). In August or September 2000, a recession started in the \nsteel industry. By mid-2002, economic conditions had continued to spiral downward, \nand Applicant realized his company was undercapitalized. He then negotiated a \n$400,000 loan with a state economic development group. The economy did not improve \nand in December 2003, Applicant and the bank decided the business was no longer \nviable. (Tr. 17). \n \n \n By that time, Applicant had reduced the $5 million dollar loan to $3.1 million. \nAfter discussing the situation with the bank, Applicant agreed to liquidate the company\u2019s \nassets and avoid a corporate or personal bankruptcy. (Tr. 17). He received $750,000 \nfrom the sale of the assets and used it to reduce the loan to $2,450,000. In addition, he \ngave the bank 80% of the equity in his home and the bank wrote-off the remainder of \nthe loan. (Tr. 19). In order to resolve the other outstanding loan, he withdrew $90,000 \nfrom his 401(k) and obtained a $40,000 loan from a friend. He paid the economic \ndevelopment group $40,000 and used $90,000 for additional payments to the bank and \nto resolve $40,000-$42,000 in credit card debt with seven or eight companies. (Tr. 19; \n22).   \n \n \nApplicant hired a lawyer to negotiate a resolution with the bank and the \nunsecured creditors. He asked his lawyer to contact all of the credit card companies and \nnegotiate a settlement. (Tr. 21). After notifying all of the insecured creditors of \nApplicant\u2019s interest in settling the debts, his lawyer resolved all of them in 2005, for \napproximately 10-15% of the final balance, except for the three credit card companies \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nlisted in the SOR. These are the only debts from the failed business that remain \nunresolved. (Tr. 66; 74). \n \n \nAs of December 27, 2007, the three debts alleged in the SOR, now total $42,000, \nand include substantial finance charges and fees.1 Since communicating with the three \ncreditors between 2004 and 2005, neither Applicant nor his lawyer ever received any \ncommunication from the creditors, until ten days ago when Applicant received \ncorrespondence from the creditor listed in \u00b6 1.a, who now asserts a $26,000 debt. (Tr. \n22; 59; GE 3). He did not pursue the creditors over the past two years because they \nnever responded to his attorney\u2019s previous communications, and he did not have \nsufficient funds to pay them. (Tr. 67). After receiving the SOR in early April 2008, he \ndiscussed resolution of the debts with his counsel, but they decided not to re-contact the \ncreditors because of Applicant\u2019 cash flow problems. (Tr. 67). He believes he could \nresolve the debts for about $8,000 to $10,000. (Tr. 34). He intends to do so in the future \nand will borrow money from his family, if necessary. (Tr. 67). Prior to this situation, he \nnever experienced financial difficulties. (Tr. 67). He does not anticipate starting any \nbusiness in the future.  \n \n \n \nApplicant spent approximately $250,000 of his personal funds to resolve his \nloans, rather than filing for bankruptcy. He felt \u201clike it was better to continue to work with \nall the unsecured creditors the best I had and took all the cash and equity that we had \navailable and worked out settlements with everyone that we could that was willing to \nwork [sic].\u201d (Tr.20).  He further elaborated that \u201cI voluntarily took those assets out of the \n401(k) and gave up future earnings and future security so that I could settle, come to \ngrips with this financial disaster that we had as a result of the business closing.\u201d (Tr. 26). \n \n \nAfter he completed the dissolution of the company in June 2005, Applicant \nbecame the president of an international investment company. In November 2006, he \nstarted his current position with a federal contractor. He is the president and Chief \nOperating Officer, with an annual salary of $150,000. According to his budget, his net \nmonthly income is $9,746 and his expenses are $8,895, leaving a remainder of about \n$850. According to the November 2007 CBR, Applicant is managing his current \nfinancial obligations. (GE 4).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor and the company\u2019s security officer are aware of his \nprevious financial problems. (Tr. 68).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                            \n1SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $20,562 debt; SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $17,582 debt, although the November \n2007 CBR lists the debt as $10,446; and SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $3,938 debt. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt after his steel \nbusiness failed in 2003. He resolved all of the financial obligations arising from that \nendeavor, except three credit card debts that remain unresolved today, partially \nbecause he has not had the money to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n  \nThe circumstances underlying Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were \u201cunusual,\u201d \nand were brought about by an unpredicted economic recession in the steel business \nstarting after he purchased the company in 2000. Those circumstances were \u201cbeyond \nhis control\u201d and do not cast doubt on his reliability or good judgment. While winding \ndown the multi-million dollar business, he resolved two loans, five or six credit card \ndebts, and offered to resolve the three debts listed in the SOR. His actions \ndemonstrated responsible conduct. It is particularly impressive that Applicant used his \nown retirement savings to resolve some of these debts, voluntarily foregoing his future \nfinancial retirement security to repay his business debts.  He did not file bankruptcy for \nhis business or his personal finances.  He did not avoid or deny his financial obligations \nin closing out the steel business he operated, which only failed because of market \nconditions over which he had no control.  He is currently employed and does not intend \nto start another business. Prior to this situation, he never experienced financial \ndifficulties. Both AG \u00b6 19(a) and AG  \u00b6 19(b) are applicable. \n \nApplicant did not obtain financial counseling, but worked with his lawyer in \nresolving his failed business and the debts that resulted. He relied on his attorney\u2019s \nadvice in these matters.  At this time, there is no evidence that the three debts listed in \nthe SOR have been resolved; hence, AG \u00b6 19(c) has limited application. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lawyer attempted to resolve the three debts a couple of years ago. \nAlthough his lawyer corresponded with the creditors in 2004 or 2005 with an offer to \nsettle the debts, they never responded, until very recently. That previous offer can be \nconstrued as a \u201cgood-faith\u201d attempt to resolve the matters, and is sufficient to trigger a \npartial application of AG \u00b6 1(d). If he had documented a subsequent attempt to resolve \nthe matter, full application of the mitigating condition would be warranted. \n \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 1.e and AG \u00b6 1.f. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 49-year-old man, who \nhad been in an accounting partnership for twenty years before he decided to buy a steel \nbusiness in 2000. He received a $5 million dollar loan from his bank and a $400,000 \nloan from a local development group, indicating their strong support for the endeavor. \nWhen the business failed in 2003 because of economic changes in the marketplace, he \nworked with the bank to resolve the outstanding $2,450,000 on the loan and with the \ndevelopment group to resolve a $400,000 loan. At the time he was closing the business \nin 2004 to 2005, he also held seven or eight credit cards with an aggregate balance of \n$40-42,000. Through the assistance of his lawyer, he resolved all of those accounts by \n2005, but the three alleged in the SOR. Seemingly, the only reason they were not \nresolved at the time was because the creditors failed to respond to the lawyer\u2019s written \ninquiries. Recently, one of them contacted Applicant. \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s actions, while closing the business, demonstrate a pattern of \nresponsible behavior in managing his financial obligations, including the forfeiture of his \n401(k) and equity in his home. At the time, he could have chosen to file bankruptcy, but \ndid not. He acknowledged his three remaining debts and expressed an intention to \nresolve them. Prior to this financial predicament, he had not experienced financial \ndifficulties and had managed to accumulate sufficient assets and reputation to warrant a \nbank\u2019s trust and support in his business. According to the most recent CBR, he \ncontinues to manage his current obligations. His employer is aware of the security \nconcerns.  \n \n While Applicant could have been more persistent in seeking a resolution of the \nSOR debts, and especially after receiving the SOR and learning of the Government\u2019s \nconcerns, I believe, based on his past performance of responsibly paying his debts, he \nwill resolve the remaining debts in the near future. He made the attempt to pay them \nthree years ago, and only the failure of the creditors to respond to his offers prevented \nhis resolution of these debts before now.  He is very aware of the effect that such \nobligations may have on his employment and is concerned about his credit rating. I do \nnot believe similar financial problems will recur.  I give great weight to the professionally \nresponsible manner in which Applicant worked diligently to resolve the closure of his \nformer business. These actions reflect favorably upon his honesty and his integrity.  \nThere is no other evidence in his background to indicate that his financial problems may \ncreate a security risk. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old electronic maintenance technician employed by a defense contractor since February 2004. His father worked for the U.S. government for 26 years and married a foreign national while assigned overseas. Applicant was born and raised overseas. Applicant began using marijuana occasionally while he was in high school, about once every two months (Tr. 55). He stopped using marijuana in January 2000, when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 58). He received a security clearance in January 2001, but it was revoked in 2002. He believes his clearance was revoked because he was born and raised in a foreign country, his mother is a dual national, and he was briefly married to a foreign national (Tr. 36, 40-42). His wife returned to her native country in 2002, and they are now divorced (Tr. 37). Applicant became disenchanted with the Navy because he could not work as an electronics technician without a clearance. He did not use any illegal substances until October 2003, when he absented himself without authority for about three weeks to visit his girlfriend, who was addicted to cocaine (Tr. 61-62).

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 10, 2006. On \nJuly 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 29, 2009; answered it on August 13, 2009; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nAugust 25, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 16, 2009, and \nthe case was assigned to me on October 20, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 27, 2009, scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \nI kept the record open until December 4, 2009 to enable Applicant to submit additional \nevidence. He timely submitted AX D through G. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 30, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 2.a, 2.b, and 3.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old electronic maintenance technician employed by a \ndefense contractor since February 2004. His father worked for the U.S. government for \n26 years and married a foreign national while assigned overseas. Applicant was born \nand raised overseas.  \n \nApplicant began using marijuana occasionally while he was in high school, about \nonce every two months (Tr. 55). He stopped using marijuana in January 2000, when he \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 58). He received a security clearance in January 2001, but \nit was revoked in 2002. He believes his clearance was revoked because he was born \nand raised in a foreign country, his mother is a dual national, and he was briefly married \nto a foreign national (Tr. 36, 40-42). His wife returned to her native country in 2002, and \nthey are now divorced (Tr. 37).  \n \nApplicant became disenchanted with the Navy because he could not work as an \nelectronics technician without a clearance. He did not use any illegal substances until \nOctober 2003, when he absented himself without authority for about three weeks to visit \nhis girlfriend, who was addicted to cocaine (Tr. 61-62). He used cocaine three or four \ntimes during his last week with his girlfriend (Tr. 66-67).  \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant tested positive for cocaine in a urinalysis conducted \nafter he returned from his unauthorized absence (GX 7 at 9; Tr. 47). In October 2003, \nhe received nonjudicial punishment for unauthorized absence (GX 7 at 4). In November \n2003, he received nonjudicial punishment for wrongful use of a controlled substance (as \na result of the urinalysis) and assault (GX 7 at 5). The assault occurred during a \nconfrontation with a first class petty officer (Tr. 52). In December 2003, he was \ndischarged from the Navy under other than honorable conditions (GX 7 at 1, 6-8).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn February 2004, about two months after he was discharged from the Navy, he \nwas hired by his current employer (Tr. 65). He used ecstasy for the first time at a party \nin March or April 2004 (Tr. 70), and he continued to use it once or twice a month until he \nwas arrested in October 2004 (Tr. 72). During the same period, he occasionally used \ncrystal methamphetamine as a stimulant in the morning (GX 5 at 7; Tr. 80). \n \nOn September 29, 2004, Applicant sold 45 ecstasy pills to an undercover police \ndetective for $640. On October 19, 2004, he sold 100 ecstasy pills to the same \ndetective for $1,650. On October 29, 2004, he met the same detective to consummate a \nsale of 300 ecstasy pills for $3,300. Applicant was arrested after delivering the pills to \nthe detective. Written statements from the detective reflect that Applicant was willing to \nsell cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, pharmaceuticals, and mushrooms. Applicant\u2019s \nresidence was searched and several plastic bags of ecstasy pills and crystal \nmethamphetamine were seized (GX 5 at 1-13). \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant was indicted for possession of a controlled \nsubstance with intent to distribute. He testified he was selling ecstasy to generate funds \nto pay his girlfriend\u2019s medical bills and to buy drugs. He denied selling \nmethamphetamine but admitted he possessed it at the time of his arrest (Tr. 75). He \npleaded guilty in June 2005. In September 2005, he was sentenced to incarceration for \n15 years and fines totaling $3,000, with all but nine months of the incarceration and all \nbut $1,000 of the fines suspended. The suspensions were conditioned on good \nbehavior for 10 years and supervised probation to begin upon release from \nincarceration and to continue until released by his probation officer. His driver\u2019s license \nwas restricted, and he was ordered to serve the nine-month unsuspended sentence on \nwork release (GX 4 at 1; GX 5 at 14-15).  \n \nWhile on work release, Applicant worked as an informant for the police and drug \nenforcement authorities. He and his girlfriend broke up while he was on work release \n(Tr. 70). He was able to continue working for his current employer while on work release \n(Tr. 82). He testified his supervisors were aware of his prior drug involvement and were \nvery supportive. He was released from supervised probation on January 14, 2008 (AX \nE). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not undergo any drug treatment (Tr. 91). There is no \nevidence that he was addicted to any illegal substances. He testified he has not used \nillegal drugs since his arrest in October 2004 (Tr. 89). He does not associate with drug \nusers (Tr. 91-92). He has a new girlfriend, the daughter of a pastor (Tr. 92).  \n \nApplicant testified his family knows about his discharge from the Navy and his \ncriminal record. They were not pleased, but they have been supportive. Applicant \ntestified that he has \u201creally good\u201d parents (Tr. 64).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance evaluation for the year ending on December 1, \n2005, rated him as \u201csatisfactory\u201d in eight categories; somewhat deficient in orderliness; \nand \u201cexceptional\u201d in quantity, accuracy, appearance, courtesy, cooperation, and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nattendance (AX C). His performance appraisal for the period ending in December 2006 \nrated him as \u201csatisfactory\u201d in seven categories; \u201cexceptional\u201d in knowledge, quantity, \nappearance, courtesy, and attendance; and \u201cclearly outstanding\u201d in cooperation (AX B). \nHis performance appraisal for the period ending in December 2007 rated him as \n\u201csatisfactory\u201d in nine categories and \u201cexceptional\u201d in knowledge, accuracy, appearance, \ncourtesy, cooperation, and stability (AX A). His appraisal for the period ending in \nNovember 2008 used a different format and rated him on specific job tasks. He received \nan overall rating of \u201ccommendable,\u201d one level below the highest rating on a five-level \nscale (AX D). His appraisal for the period ending in December 2009 awarded him a \nnumerical rating of 48 on a 60-point scale, between \u201cexceptional\u201d (45 points) and \n\u201cclearly outstanding\u201d (60 points) (AX G). \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a letter stating that Applicant has \u201covercome \ngreat odds from his past poor judgment\u201d and become a person of integrity and \nresilience and a very valuable member of the organization (AX F). The same supervisor \nalso testified at the hearing. He holds a top secret clearance and has worked for the \nsame company for 13 years. He has known Applicant since 2004 and been his \nsupervisor for two years. Applicant showed him the SOR. Before reading the SOR, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor was aware that Applicant had \u201csome issues\u201d in the Navy, but he \ndid not know the details. He has met Applicant\u2019s parents, had dinner with them, and \ntraveled with Applicant on company business. He testified that Applicant is not the \nperson described in the SOR. Instead, he has been a good worker who tends to go \nbeyond what is required and a dependable person (Tr. 103-111).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant tested positive for cocaine in a urinalysis on or about \nOctober 20, 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); used cocaine on at least four occasions from October 5, \n2003, through October 29, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); used marijuana from the age of 15 \nthrough at least October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and used ecstasy up to three times during \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The SOR also cross-alleges the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe following disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, which is defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as Athe illegal \nuse of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction\u201d;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for illegal drug use; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.  \nAG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance) is not raised \nbecause Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred before he received a clearance in January \n2001, and his use of other illegal substances occurred after his clearance was revoked \nin 2002.  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement was frequent and did not happen under such circumstances that make \nrecurrence unlikely. Thus, the analysis turns on the first prong of \u00b6 26(a) (Ahappened so \nlong ago@), which focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There are no Abright \nline@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based \non a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug involvement was in October 2004, more than five years ago. \nEven though his sentence for drug-trafficking included an indefinite period of supervised \nprobation, his supervised probation was terminated in January 2008, more than two \nyears ago. The requirement for good behavior for ten years, condition for his suspended \nsentence to imprisonment, will not be fully satisfied for four more years.  \n \nWith the exception of his experimentation with marijuana at age 15, all of his drug \ninvolvement and military misconduct occurred during a short period while he was \ninvolved with a cocaine-addicted girlfriend. Applicant terminated his relationship with \nthis girlfriend, found a new girlfriend, continued to perform well at his place of \nemployment, and voluntarily used his after-work confinement time to encourage young \ninmates to find a new drug-free lifestyle. He has gained the respect of his colleagues \nand supervisors. His sincerity and remorse were obvious during the hearing. I am \nsatisfied that he is rehabilitated. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 26(a) is established.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b). Applicant has established AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (3). \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for wrongful use of a \ncontrolled substance in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 912a, and assault in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). It also alleges he was convicted of three counts of a violation of state law by \npossessing, selling, and distributing a controlled substance (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal \nconduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation \nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally \ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s record of \nnonjudicial punishment in the Navy and violation of state law after his discharge from \nthe Navy are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). For the reasons set out \nabove in my discussion of AG \u00b6 26(a) under Guideline H, I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe person was \npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present \nin the person's life.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(b). Applicant was not pressured or coerced in the usual \nsense of threats or illegal inducements, but his misguided devotion to his girlfriend \nmotivated him to use illegal drugs and to sell drugs to finance her medical treatment and \nbuy more drugs. He terminated their relationship while he was serving his term of work \nrelease, and he is now involved in a more wholesome romantic relationship. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 32(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreasons set out above in my discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b), I conclude this \nmitigating condition is established.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was discharged from the Navy under other than \nhonorable conditions due to misconduct and drug use (SOR \u00b6 3.a). It also cross-alleges \nthe criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b as personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.b). The \nconcern under this guideline is that \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a, alleging Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Navy, does not allege an \nindependent basis for security concerns. Instead, it alleges only the consequences of \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct in the Navy. Unlike a dishonorable discharge or dismissal from \nthe service, which are punitive separations from the service that be imposed only by a \ncourt-martial, and which trigger a specific disqualification under Guideline J, an other \nthan honorable discharge is an administrative separation and does not establish an \nenumerated disqualifying condition.  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised by the \ncriminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a and 2.b and cross-alleged under this guideline in \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: \nAG 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; \nAG 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nduress, such as  . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and \nAG 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s association with persons involved in criminal activity, i.e., his drug-\nusing girlfriend, and the drug sellers and drug buyers he dealt with, was not specifically \nalleged in the SOR. I have considered this conduct for the limited purpose of deciding \nwhich adjudicative guidelines are applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether Applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; and as part of my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). For the \nreasons set out above in my discussions of AG \u00b6 26(a) under Guideline H and AG \u00b6 \n32(a) under Guideline J, I conclude this mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his behavior. He \nhas not obtained counseling, but he has eliminated the circumstances that motivated his \nbehavior by terminating his relationship with his cocaine-addicted girlfriend. \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). \nThis mitigating condition is established because Applicant made full disclosure of his \ndrug-related problems to his supervisors and his family. \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). This mitigating condition is established \nbecause Applicant broken contact with his former girlfriend and he has not been \ninvolved in using, buying, or selling drugs since October 2004.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H, J, and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is now a mature adult. He is blessed with a supportive family and an \nunderstanding and supportive employer. His temporary lapse into a drug-involved \nlifestyle was prompted by his unwise involvement with a cocaine-addicted girlfriend. \nThat relationship and lifestyle are behind him. He was fortunate to have been arrested \nbefore he fell deeper into a drug-centered lifestyle. There is no evidence that he \nbecame addicted to any illegal substances. He has evolved into a trusted and \ndependable employee who enjoys the respect of his supervisors.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, J, \nand E, evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve doubtful cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement, criminal conduct, and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B as the basis for its decision to deny his request for\na security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on March 22, 2008, and requested a hearing before a DOHA\nadministrative judge. On April 18, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2008. The\nparties appeared for the hearing as scheduled. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) were\nadmitted and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on May 21,\nJune 3, 2008\n\n2\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn April 16, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to the PRC and its relations with the U.S. The request was\nbased \non \npublications \nfrom \nthe \nU.S. \nState \nDepartment, \nthe \nCentre \nfor\nCounterintelligence and Security Studies, the U.S. China Economic and Security\nReview Commission, and the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive. The\ngovernment\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. \nOn April 24, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were informed that any objections would\nbe taken up at the hearing scheduled for May 9, 2008. Before the introduction of any\nevidence on May 9, I confirmed the parties had no objections. I agreed to take\nadministrative notice of particular facts pertaining to the PRC, as set forth below.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a\ncitizen of the PRC with resident alien status in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that his spouse\nhad worked as a proofreader for a newspaper possibly owned by the Chinese\ngovernment (SOR \u00b6 1.b), that his parents-in-law are PRC resident citizens (SOR \u00b6 1.c),\nthat his mother-in-law retired from her position as an accountant with a department\nwithin the Chinese government (SOR \u00b6 1.d), that his father-in-law is employed as an\nexpert within the same department of the Chinese government (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and that\nApplicant traveled to the PRC from July through August 2004, December 2004 through\nJanuary 2005, and from August to September 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted the\nallegations with explanation. Concerning his spouse\u2019s PRC citizenship, Applicant\nindicated that she is a U.S. permanent resident, and plans to apply for U.S. citizenship.\nShe had been employed as a proofreader in China, but for an advertising company and\nnot the newspaper. Applicant averred that his parents-in-law are resident citizens of the\nPRC, but they intend to move to the U.S. to live with them in the near future. He\nindicated his mother-in-law had retired \u201ca few years ago,\u201d and his father was going to\nretire in a year. Applicant maintained his parents-in-law had no knowledge of his\nemployer. As for his travels to the PRC, they were for tourism and to visit his spouse.\nSince she immigrated to the U.S. in May 2006, he denied any intent to return to the\nPRC. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old electrical engineer who has been employed by a U.S.\ndefense contractor since June 2006 (Ex. 1, Tr. 33). His present job duties do not require\n\n3\naccess to classified information (Tr. 33), but his employer has requested that he be\ngranted a security clearance (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was born in December 1977 in the PRC. He is the middle of three sons\nborn to PRC native citizens. In about October 1988, Applicant\u2019s father came to the U.S.\nto visit his uncle. He subsequently acquired legal residency in the U.S. and he\nsponsored his family\u2019s immigration.  In February 1996, Applicant immigrated to the U.S.\nwith his mother and his two brothers. Applicant graduated from public high school in\nJune 1999, and four years later, he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical\nengineering from the state university (Ex. 1, Tr. 32).\nIn late January 2002, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He took an\noath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution\nand its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on\nbehalf of the U.S. if required. By acquiring his U.S. citizenship, he was no longer a\ncitizen of the PRC (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). Applicant obtained his U.S. passport in September\n2002 (Ex. 1). His two brothers became naturalized U.S. citizens in Spring 2002 (Ex. 1),\nbut his parents lacked the English language proficiency required to obtain U.S.\ncitizenship (Tr. 26).\n After looking for a job for about six months without success, Applicant applied to\ngraduate school for the fall (Tr. 32-33). He took advantage of his time off that summer to\ntravel to the PRC as a tourist from July to August 2004 (Ex. 1, Tr. 34). Applicant spent\nabout two weeks of his trip in his hometown, where he stayed with a paternal uncle (Tr.\n34). He met his future spouse at a private party hosted by a friend of his father\u2019s (Tr. 27-\n28, 35). She is from Applicant\u2019s hometown (Ex. 1), although she and Applicant were not\npreviously acquainted (Tr. 45). They stayed in touch through email, instant messaging,\nand by telephone after Applicant returned to the U.S. (Ex. 1, Tr. 36).\nIn September 2004, Applicant began graduate studies in electrical engineering.\nDuring winter break, he went back to the PRC and married his spouse (Ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s family members did not attend his wedding as they did not approve of his\nmarriage (Tr. 36). On his return to the U.S. in January 2005, Applicant applied for his\nspouse\u2019s U.S. immigration. She remained in China awaiting her visa (Ex. 1, Tr. 37).\nApplicant understands she attended the equivalent of a community college in the PRC\nlearning business/secretarial skills (Tr. 47-48). She worked as a proofreader at a\nnewspaper, but as an employee of an advertising company, before coming to the U.S.\nApplicant believes the newspaper is owned by the local government in the PRC (Ex. 2,\nTr. 39). \nApplicant traveled again to the PRC from August to September 2005 to see his\nspouse (Ex. 1). They stayed with her parents for about a week and then traveled\ntogether in the PRC (Tr. 37). During that trip, Applicant visited with the paternal uncle\nwith whom he had stayed the year before (\u201cjust see my uncle once because my parents\nnot happy.\u201d Tr. 37).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s spouse joined him in the U.S. in late May 2006 (Ex. 1, Tr. 37). In June\n2006, Applicant was awarded his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and he\nstarted working for his present employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 33). Applicant applied for a security\nclearance for his duties on November 21, 2006. On his e-QIP, he disclosed his spouse\u2019s\nand his parents\u2019 Chinese citizenship but U.S. legal residency, his parents-in-law\u2019s PRC\ncitizenship and residency, and his travel to the PRC in 2004 and 2005. \nOn April 5, 2007, Applicant was interviewed in conjunction with his background\ninvestigation for his clearance. He indicated that since her immigration to the U.S., his\nspouse has been taking English language classes. An only child, she contacts her\nparents in the PRC about once a week. Her father was currently working for the\nChinese government in the public health area. Applicant described him as \u201can expert\u201d in\nhis field. His mother-in-law had worked as an accountant for the same governmental\ndepartment before she retired. Applicant indicated he had contact with his in-laws about\nonce or twice a year (Ex. 2).\nAt the hearing on May 8, 2008, Applicant clarified that his in-laws worked in a\nlocal health center in the PRC. His mother-in-law retired about five years ago (Tr. 25,\n42). To his knowledge, his father-in-law has been in his job for more than ten years\n(Tr.43). He plans to retire in a year (Tr. 24-25). He testified that his father-in-law only\nhas a middle school education (Tr. 25), and his duties involve educating the local\npopulace about disease prevention (Tr. 24, 43). When asked to explain what it was that\nled him in April 2007 to describe his father-in-law as an \u201cexpert,\u201d Applicant responded:\nBecause I tried to find words describing, better to describe what kinds of\njob he does, just educating people. So he has a lot of knowledge on how\nto prevent disease, so I guess that\u2019s called an expert . . . He just, he is\ngood at what he does, has experience educating people how to prevent\ndisease, do an advertisement on disease prevention. So I think I probably,\nit\u2019s a mistake (Tr. 53).\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law own their home in the PRC (Tr. 27). They have a bank\naccount but no other investments in China (Tr. 44). His mother-in-law receives a small\ngovernment pension (Tr. 42).\nApplicant bought his home in the U.S. in 2007 (Ex. 2, Tr. 48). He has no foreign\nassets (Tr. 48-49). In March 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse gave birth to their first child (Tr.\n25, 27). She contacts her parents once or twice a week to let them know how the baby\nis doing (Tr. 40). During his spouse\u2019s pregnancy, Applicant applied unsuccessfully for\nhis mother-in-law to come to the U.S. to visit (Tr. 41). Applicant was led to believe from\nhis mother-in-law that the visa was denied because of concerns that she would not\nreturn to the PRC (Tr. 46).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible.\nAfter she becomes a U.S. citizen, she plans to sponsor her parents\u2019 immigration to the\nU.S. (Tr. 21-22, 47). Applicant believes his in-laws will sell their home and come to the\n\n5\nU.S. since his spouse is their only child (Tr. 27). All of her extended family members\n(aunts, uncles, cousins) reside in the PRC, but she has no contact with them (Tr. 39-\n40). Every six months or so, she contacts a couple of friends in China (Tr. 40), one of\nwhom is an elementary school teacher (Tr. 44-45). Applicant\u2019s spouse knows he is\napplying for a security clearance, but he has advised her not to tell anyone of his\nemployment (Tr. 48).\n*     *     *\nFollowing review of the source documents provided by the government that\naddress the economic, political, and intelligence activities of the PRC, I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts:\nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of just\nover 1.3  billion people. Its economy grows at about 10% per year. China has an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The National\nPeople\u2019s Congress, the PRC\u2019s legislative body, is the highest organ of state power. With\nChina firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of\npeople and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all\nimportant government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese\nCommunist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2007,\nthe PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend toward\nincreased harassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security\nauthorities of those perceived as threatening to government authority. Foreign visitors in\nthe PRC may be placed under surveillance by security personnel, their hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their personal possessions,\nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent. Foreign government\nofficials, journalists, and business people with access to advanced proprietary\ntechnology are particularly likely to be under surveillance.\nSince the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989, the PRC has become a\nkey participant in the international community through its seat as a permanent member\nof the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other countries. The U.S.\nand PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific and environmental issues.\nRecently, the two countries have cooperated with growing effectiveness on\ncounterterrorism and on various aspects of law enforcement (computer crime,\nintellectual property rights, human smuggling, corruption). China, a member of the\nWorld Trade Organization since December 2001, is an important trading partner of the\nU.S. Its trade surplus with the U.S. was $256.3 billion in 2007 while U.S. goods exports\nto China accounted for 5.7% of total U.S. goods exports. The U.S. is the sixth largest\nforeign investor in the PRC.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy\nand air force), which are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh-tech military. In the last decade, the PRC\u2019s strategic posture has been one of\nselective modernization with an increasing focus on space-based assets. Civil-military\n\n6\nintegration has led to increased utilization of commercial systems in military\napplications. The PRC places enormous pressure on foreign companies, including U.S.\nfirms, to transfer technology to Chinese companies as part of doing business in China.\nIn furtherance of these efforts, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive and\nprotected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export control laws.\nThe PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert espionage\nactivity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military\nindustries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting ethnic\nChinese who have access to sensitive information. U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the\nleading threat to the security of U.S. technology.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\n\n7\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and brothers are all residents of the U.S. His father has been\nin the U.S. since 1988, and under his sponsorship, Applicant, his mother, and his\nbrothers immigrated to the U.S. in February 1996. Like Applicant, his brothers have\nbeen citizens of the U.S. since 2002. However, while vacationing in the PRC in July\n2004, Applicant met, and within six months married his spouse against his family\u2019s\nwishes. She immigrated to the U.S. in May 2006, but remains a citizen of the PRC\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). Her parents are PRC resident citizens (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under AG \u00b6 7(a)\nsecurity concerns are raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d The risk of undue foreign influence is minimal with\nregard to his spouse\u2019s foreign citizenship. A new mother, she enjoys the protections of\nher U.S. legal residency, has no plans to return to China, and intends to apply for her\nU.S. citizenship and then sponsor her parents\u2019 immigration. There is nothing about her\nformer employment as a proofreader for a newspaper in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that\nsuggests military, security, or intelligence implications. Even if the newspaper was\ngovernment-owned, she was apparently an employee of an advertising company and\nnot a civil servant.\n\n8\nThe risk of undue foreign influence is heightened primarily because of the PRC\ncitizenship and residency of Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and their\nconnections to the Chinese government through a public health agency (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d\nand 1.e). Applicant does not share particularly strong bonds of affection with his in-laws.\nWhile he stayed with them for about a week during a trip to see his spouse in August\n2005, he speaks with them only about once or twice a year. Applicant\u2019s spouse\nunderstandably has close ties to her parents. Their only child, she contacts them once\nor twice a week. The bond of affection is also evident in the effort to acquire a visa for\nher mother to come to the U.S. when she was pregnant. AG \u00b6 7(a) and \u00b6 7(d) (sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion) apply.\nConcerns about Applicant\u2019s travel to the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.f) are legitimately raised\nin that it led to his marriage. His intent in traveling to the PRC in July 2004 was for\ntourism, but while visiting his hometown, he met his spouse at a private party hosted by\nhis father\u2019s friend. They continued their long distance relationship after Applicant\nreturned to the U.S. for graduate school. Within a few months, Applicant went back to\nthe PRC in December 2004 to marry. While awaiting his spouse\u2019s legal immigration to\nthe U.S., Applicant visited her in the PRC in August 2005. However, since she\nimmigrated to the U.S., Applicant no longer has a reason to travel to China and he has\nno intent to do so. There is no evidence that Applicant engaged in any conduct while in\nthe PRC that implicates security concerns under \u00b6 7(i) (conduct, especially while\ntraveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country) other than\nestablishing the ties through marriage to his parents-in-law, which are more\nappropriately addressed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(d).\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) does not apply. In addition to\nthe concerns raised by the closeness of the relationship between his spouse and her\nparents, the PRC is known to aggressively target U.S. sensitive and classified\ninformation. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law also works for the Chinese government, apparently\nat the local level. What is known about his duties is that he educates the local populace\nabout disease prevention and that he is good at what he does. There is nothing in the\nrecord to suggest he is likely to be targeted by those seeking to obtain classified\ninformation, but not enough is known about his activities and associates to safely\ndiscount the risk of undue foreign influence. Moreover, even though Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law has been retired for about five years from her accountant position with the same\nChinese agency, the U.S. government turned down her request for a visa in 2007.\nApplicant testified to his belief it was solely out of concern that she would not return to\nthe PRC. Yet she had her spouse and a home to return to in the PRC, which raises the\npossibility that there was more to the denial beyond what Applicant knows.\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence through his spouse\u2019s close\nrelationships with her parents may be overcome by deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest)). Applicant asserts a singular loyalty to the U.S.\nwhere he is invested financially and professionally. He emigrated in February 1996\nwhen he was 18. He attended three years of high school in the U.S. when he was older\nthan his peers, and then earned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical\nengineering. While he has a paternal uncle in the PRC with whom he stayed in 2004\nand visited in 2005, his closest relatives (spouse, newborn daughter, parents, and\nbrother) are all in the U.S. One might reasonably question how well he knew his spouse\nwhen he married her in December 2004, given they had been acquainted for fewer than\nsix months and it was primarily a long distance relationship. But there is no indication\nthat he went to the PRC in July 2004 looking for a bride, and she has been granted\nlawful permanent residency in the U.S.\nThe fact that he would marry in China apparently against his parents\u2019 wishes\n(\u201cBecause my parents doesn\u2019t [sic] really want me to go back to get married, they want\nme to marry here, but I just feel I love my wife so much so I had to go back.\u201d Tr. 36)\nconfirms the strong emotional bond Applicant has with his spouse, which has likely been\nstrengthened over the past two years that they have been together in the U.S.\nApplicant has exhibited good judgment in advising his spouse to not divulge his\nemployment to her parents, but he has not met his burden of proving the deep and\nlongstanding ties required to overcome the risk of undue foreign influence.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. (See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7). An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be in an\n\n10\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s connections to the PRC are now primarily through\nhis spouse and her close relationships there. While he is sincere in his intention to\nremain in the U.S., I am unable to conclude at present that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines C, F, and E are not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford\nH. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing to conclude\nthat Applicant had mitigated the Guideline B security concerns in his case.   Finding no error, we\n1\naffirm. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 51-year-old employee\nof a Defense contractor.  Born in Lebanon, he came to the U.S. to pursue his education.  He became\na U.S. citizen in the mid-1980s and received his B.A. degree in the year following.  He married his\nwife, a Lebanese citizen and U.S. resident alien, in the early 2000s.  Applicant\u2019s parents and brother\nlive in Lebanon, as does his mother-in-law.  He sends between $1,000 and $1,400 per month to both\nfamilies in Lebanon.  Applicant stated during his testimony that his parents are more important to\nhim than Lebanon, that he has loyalty to his relatives but not to Lebanon itself.  Although the U.S.\nhas close ties with Lebanon, that country has experienced social and political instability in the recent\npast.  Lebanon\u2019s internal policies are heavily influenced by Syria, which is a state sponsor of\nterrorism.  Foreign terrorist organizations operate within Lebanon\u2019s borders.  These include\nHezbollah, which the Lebanese government recognizes as a political party.  Hezbollah is allied with\nIran and has been involved in several attempts to obtain U.S. technology.  Lebanon has a poor human\nrights record.  \u201cMilitias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of Lebanese central\ngovernment authority have used informers and monitored telephones to obtain information about\ntheir perceived adversaries.\u201d  Decision at 4.\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant points to decisions by the Hearing Office, which he argues\nsupport his request for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.\nHowever, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing\nOffice decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Applicant argues that the Judge did not properly\nconsider his mitigating evidence regarding his strong ties to the U.S.  However, a party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).   A Judge is presumed to have considered all the\nevidence in the record unless he specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 07-00196 at\n3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  \n\n3\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C, B, F and E stating why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 8, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 4, 2008.  This case was assigned to me on June 6, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n14, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nreceived without objection. The Applicant testified on his own and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through T, also without objection.  The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for the submission of additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits U through AA on August 21, 2008, and August 27, 2008.  These\nexhibits were also received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on August 25, 2008.  The record closed on August 29, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Lebanese Republic (Lebanon). (Transcript at 18-20.) The\nrequest and the allied documents were not admitted into evidence, but are included in\nthe record.  The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general\nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute.  The facts administratively noticed\nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 51 and married.  He is employed by a Defense contractor and\nseeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in the Statement of\nReasons.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nThe Government alleges in Paragraph 1 that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has acted in such a way that shows a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States.\nThe Applicant had and used a Lebanese passport to travel to Lebanon after he\nbecame an American citizen.

The Applicant testified that he\nretained the Lebanese passport to ease his entry into Lebanon, because he would not\nhave to obtain a Lebanese visa.  He further stated that he would only use his United\nStates passport in the future.  (Transcript at 31-32, 68-70.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)\nThe Government alleges in Paragraph 2 that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant was born in Lebanon in 1957.  In addition to his parents, he has\none brother.  The Applicant came to the United States in 1979 to continue his\neducation.  He received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in 1987.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  He\nhas had a successful business career in the United States.  Currently his net worth is\nabout $100,000.00.  (Transcript at 70-73.) \nHe became an American citizen on May 23, 1986.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit V.)  He\nsaid the following regarding his conduct if forced to choose between Lebanon and the\nUnited States: \u201cI would put the interests of the United States first because, like I said,\nthe United States gave me everything I have right now.  That\u2019s true I was born in\nLebanon and - - but I live here, I get my education over here, I have my future here.  I\nlove this country and it\u2019s my plan - - I would never, ever do anything to harm this\ncountry.\u201d  (Transcript at 36-37.)  He stated firmly that he would not respond to any\nrequest for information and would notify his company\u2019s security department if\napproached.  (Transcript at 31.)\nThe Applicant married his Lebanese born wife on October 14, 2002.  She is a\nresident alien here in the United States.  The Applicant testified that his wife applied for\nAmerican citizenship in 2008.  Her mother also lives in Lebanon.  (Transcript at 26-27.)\nAs stated earlier, the Applicant\u2019s parents and brother continue to live in Lebanon,\nspecifically in the Bekaa Valley.  Applicant and his wife have fairly frequent contact with\ntheir families in Lebanon, speaking to them about weekly.  The Applicant send between\n$1,000.00 and $1,400.00 a month to both families in Lebanon.  Finally, the Applicant\nstated several times that he loves his parents a great deal, and that they are more\nimportant to him than Lebanon.  (Transcript at 73-39.)\nIn an interview in 2007, the investigator wrote that the Applicant indicated or\nstated, \u201cThere is no conflict between Lebanon and the United States. [The Applicant\u2019s]\nloyalty lies with the U.S.  His degree of loyalty to Lebanon is 20-30 percent.\u201d\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n1\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Notice Documents I through X.)\n4\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)  The Applicant denied using a percentage during the\ninterview.  He did indicate that he had loyalty to his relatives, but not to Lebanon itself.\nHe further stated, \u201cI have everything I need in life here.  Why would I want to jeopardize\nthat and have loyalty to a different country.  I mean, I have loyalty to my family, but not\nto the country itself.\u201d  (Transcript at 81.)\nThe Applicant has contacts with Lebanon.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the relationship between Lebanon and the United States at this time.   I take\n1\nadministrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about Lebanon. Lebanon is a\nparliamentary republic that became independent in November 1943. The U.S. policy is\nto maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and to help preserve its\nindependence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. Since its\nindependence, Lebanon\u2019s national policy has been determined by a small group of\nregional and sectarian leaders. Political institutions often play a secondary role to\nreligion and personality-based politics. Lebanon has been in a state of war with Israel\nsince 1973. Civil war broke out in April 1975 and did not end until 1991. Since 1992,\nLebanon has experienced social and political instability, economic uncertainty, lack of\ninfrastructure, violent clashes with Israeli forces, and political assassinations.\nI also take administrative notice that Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy and internal\npolicies are heavily influenced by Syria, which maintains intelligence agents in Lebanon\nand is a state sponsor of terrorism. The unstable political situation in Lebanon enables\nforeign terrorist organizations to operate within its borders. Hezbollah is the most\nprominent terrorist group in Lebanon, and it has been designated by the U.S.\nDepartment of State as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The Lebanese government\nrecognizes Hezbollah as a legitimate resistance group and political party. Hezbollah\nmaintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon, is closely allied with Iran,\nsupports a variety of violent anti-Western groups, and has been involved in numerous\nanti-U.S. terrorist attacks. Hezbollah seeks to obtain U.S. technology, has been involved\nin several efforts to obtain restricted, dual-use technology, and is considered by the U.S.\nto be the most technically capable terrorist group in the world.  A center for Hezbollah\nand Syrian activity is the Bekaa Valley.  \nFinally, I take administrative notice that Lebanon has a poor human rights record\nand has been ineffective in controlling terrorism and political violence. Lebanese\nsecurity forces have engaged in arbitrary arrest, murder, torture, and other abuses.\nThere is an atmosphere of governmental corruption and lack of transparency. Militias\nand non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of Lebanese central government\nauthority have used informers and monitored telephones to obtain information about\ntheir perceived adversaries. Ongoing political violence and terrorism directed at\nAmericans and U.S. interests make Lebanon dangerous for U.S. citizens. \n\n5\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he in financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.\nThe Applicant testified that a year long period of unemployment between 2002\nand 2003 left him unable to pay his debts.  He has since resolved two of the three debts\nalleged in the SOR, as well as paying off other debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits K, L and M.)\nThe Applicant was indebted to American Express in the approximate amount of\n$827.00 (SOR 2.a.).  This debt was paid in June 2008.  (Transcript at 37; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit J.)\nThe Applicant was in a dispute with LVNV Funding as to a debt in the\napproximate amount of $6,839.00 for Bank of America (SOR 2.b.).  The Applicant has\nconsistently stated that this debt was the result of a \u201cfriend\u201d using the Applicant\u2019s credit\ncard without his knowledge and buying equipment for the friend\u2019s business.  The\nApplicant has resolved the debt and paid $2,572.00 in settlement.  (Transcript at 37-40,\n52- 64; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Z.) \nThe Applicant cannot admit or deny that he owes a medical debt of\napproximately $395.00 (SOR 2.c.).  He has been unable to find any information on this\ndebt because none of the available credit reports provide any contact information as to\nthe creditor or a collection agency.  (Transcript at 43-44, 50-52; Government Exhibits 6,\n7, 8 and 9; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits  R, S and T.)\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Department of Defense during\nthe clearance screening process.\nIn 2005, the Applicant filled out a Security Clearance Application in which he\nstated that he was over 180 days delinquent on the debt set forth in allegation 2.b.,\nabove.  That was true.  He also remarked that his loss of employment and wife\u2019s health\nproblems created a financial hardship and he was unable to maintain payments on this\ndebt.  That was also true.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 38.)\nThe Applicant filled out an Interrogatory in January 2008.  In this document, he\nstated that the debt in 2.b. was the result of fraud and that he was having it investigated.\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 3, 9.)  \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports show that, beginning in March 2002, the\nApplicant notified the credit agencies that he was a credit fraud victim.  (Government\nExhibit 6 at 1 and Government Exhibit 7 at 1.)  \n\n6\nThe Applicant testified at length about this debt, how it was incurred, why he\nbegan paying it, and why he stopped.  He was cross-examined extensively on this point.\nHis version of events is credible and believable.  (Transcript at 40-43, 52-68.)  In\nessence, a friend defrauded the Applicant and, after it was discovered, told the\nApplicant that he would pay the debt. This person failed to do it.  The Applicant, in a\nmisguided attempt to preserve his credit, made payments on the account rather than\nreport it as a fraud.  The Applicant eventually attempted to inform the creditor of the\nfraud, but the creditor informed him that, having made some payments on the account,\nthe Applicant was now legally responsible for it.  \nWhile his decisions may not have been those of a trained attorney, they are not\non their face unreasonable.  In addition, his answer on the Security Clearance\nApplication was true, if somewhat incomplete.  Under the particular facts of this case, I\ndo not find that his answers were false, or that they were intended to mislead the\nGovernment in any way.   This paragraph is found for the Applicant as the Government\nhas failed to show that any falsehood was made.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a highly respected person in his field.  He presented\nrecommendations from co-workers and supervisors that are very laudatory.  The letters\ndescribe the Applicant as \u201ctrustworthy, dependable and compassionate,\u201d \u201chonest, loyal,\u201d\nand \u201cstraight forward.\u201d  All of these people recommend the Applicant for a position of\ntrust.  (Transcript at 46-49; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant had a valid Lebanese passport that he used for travel\n(Guideline C), that he has family members in Lebanon (Guideline B), and that he had\nfinancial difficulties (Guideline F).  The Government did not meet its burden in showing\nthat the Applicant made false statements in the clearance screening process (Guideline\n\n8\nE.)  The Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully mitigated the Government's\ncase, except in part.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about his possession and use of his Lebanese passport after becoming an\nAmerican citizen.  The concern is stated thus under this Guideline, When an individual\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United\nStates, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe Applicant had a valid Lebanese passport after becoming an American\ncitizen.  Accordingly, Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case:\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a)\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport. \nThe Applicant has surrendered his passport to his company\u2019s facility security\nofficer.  Accordingly, as required by Mitigating Condition 11(e) his Lebanese passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.  \nI have considered the Applicant\u2019s using his Lebanese passport to travel to\nLebanon after becoming an American citizen.  As stated above, he would use both\npassports to travel, and has indicated a credible intent to only use his American\npassport in the future.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant and his wife live in the United States.  They have friends and\ninvestments here.  His net worth is about $100,000.00.\n\n9\nBoth of them, however, have connections to family in Lebanon.  As described\nabove, his parents, her mother, as well as siblings still live in Lebanon.  By his own\nwords, the Applicant stated that he has strong feelings for his family in Lebanon.  This is\nshown by his repeated trips to Lebanon, five since 2000.  The last trip, as described\nabove, took place in December 2007-January 2008.  It is also shown by his sending\nsubstantial sums of money, approximately $12,000.00 a year, to Lebanon. \nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the situation in\nLebanon, and in particular Hezbollah\u2019s history of attempting to obtain classified and\nother information from Americans and American companies.  To his credit, the Applicant\nrepeatedly stated that he is a loyal American citizen, that he understands his\nresponsibilities as a security clearance holder, and that he would not be a party to any\nattempt by anyone in Lebanon to obtain information from him.  However, given the\ndepth and extent of his connections with Lebanon, he has failed to meet his burden of\nshowing an unequivocal connection to the United States. \nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  I have also considered the information concerning the situation in Lebanon,\nprovided by Department Counsel in their administrative notice documents. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest; and (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.  Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.\n\n10\nParagraph 3 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in\nAG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay several of his debts for a period of years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  The Applicant was laid off\nbetween 2002 and 2003.  The Applicant has paid off all of his debts but one, and on that\none he is unable to find sufficient information to allow him to make a payment.  The\nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant successfully\nshowed that he has successfully paid off two of the three debts alleged in the SOR, in\naddition to resolving other debts.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  As set forth at length above, the\nApplicant had a legitimate dispute with concerning the debt in 2.b.  In order to resolve\nthis issue, he accepted a settlement and paid this debt.  This mitigating condition clearly\napplies to the facts of this case.  For all the foregoing reasons, Paragraph 3 is found for\nthe Applicant.\nParagraph 4 (Personal Conduct)\nThe Government failed to show that the Applicant made any false statements.\nThis Paragraph is found for the Applicant.\n\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThis is a close case.  The Applicant is an able, intelligent and respected member\nof the Defense industry.  He is obviously a loyal American citizen.  I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case, in particular his connections to Lebanon.  Two of\nthe factors have the most impact on this case.  First, I cannot find that there is the\n\u201cpresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set\nforth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  The Applicant simply has not proved that he has sufficient\nconnections in this country, as opposed to those in Lebanon, which shows a preference\nfor the United States instead of Lebanon.  In addition, given the terrorist situation in\nLebanon, it is not possible for me to find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8) given his particular\ncircumstances. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\nstated above, Paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 are found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n12\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), on October 12, 2006. On March 5, 2008, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F, J and H for Applicant. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n \n \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, which \nDOHA received on April 8, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 28, \n2008, and I received the case assignment on April 29, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on May 2, 2008, scheduling the case to be heard on May 22, \n2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits, and testified on his \nown behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nand did not respond to \u00b6\u00b6 2., 2.a., 3., and 3.a. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old security officer, who has been employed by a \ngovernment contractor since October 2006. He seeks to retain the interim secret \nsecurity clearance he was granted shortly after completing his e-QIP in October \n2006. GE 1, Tr. 15, 35.  \n \nApplicant dropped out of high school in 1971 after completing the 11th \ngrade. \nHe \nparticipated \nin \na \nhome \nstudy \ncourse \noffered \nthrough \na \nvocational/technical/trade school from June 2000 to January 2003, and was \nawarded his high school diploma in February 2003. GE 1, Tr. 14-15, 33-35. He \nserved in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 1972 to May 1976, and was honorably \ndischarged as a lance corporal (pay grade E-3). His Military Occupational \nSpecialty was 3051/Warehouse Clerk. GE 1, Tr. 36-37. Applicant has been \nmarried since July 1980, and has three adult stepchildren. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 2006 e-QIP, he failed to disclose \nmaterial facts regarding his employment record, his past drug use, and his \nfinancial record. Regarding his employment record, he failed to disclose that he \nhad been terminated in April 2006 by a previous employer for testing positive for \nmarijuana during a drug test. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.)  \n \nRegarding his past drug use, he failed to disclose that he used marijuana, \nwith varying frequency, to include four times weekly from about 1973 to April \n2006. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Regarding his financial record, he failed to disclose that his \nhome went into foreclosure in March 2001, and was later sold at a public auction \nin May 2001. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) He denied this falsification, and testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t \nsee that question on the security application\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand the \nquestion.\u201d Tr. 29. \n \n\n \n3\nFor purposes of clarification, Applicant was interviewed two times by an \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) Investigator following submission of his \nOctober 2006 E-QIP. The first interview occurred in November 2006, and the \nsecond interview occurred in April 2007. When Applicant was interviewed the first \ntime by an OPM Investigator, he was asked about his April 2006 termination for \ntesting positive for marijuana. He lied to the OPM Investigator, telling him that he \nresigned from his job in anticipation of obtaining a different job. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \n \n During his first interview in November 2006 interview, Applicant stated the \nmortgage company foreclosed on his property and after doing so never contacted \nhim or took any action against him. He added he became aware of the foreclosure \nwhen he saw it reported on his credit bureau report. GE 2. During that same \ninterview, when asked about his past drug use, Applicant lied to the OPM \nInvestigator telling him he had used marijuana 10 to 15 times during a one month \nperiod in 1994 and denied any further use of any illegal drugs. \n \nApplicant explained: \n \nWhen I was interviewed by an investigator for a clearance I did not \nthink the interview was a serious matter and did not want anyone to \nknow anything about shameful things in my past that I did which is \nwhy on the 2nd interview I told everything. I found out from a friend \nhow serious the matter is. . . . I am a loyal citizen of these United \nStates. I love my country very much and would never betray her. I \nam also not a thief. The only way I would give up classified info is to \nbe killed defending it being at my post. (Response to SOR) \n \nIt was during the second interview that he was more forthcoming about his \nApril 2006 termination for drug use and his past use of drugs. GE 2. Applicant \nlater revealed in the second interview he used marijuana, with varying frequency, \nto include four times weekly, from about 1973 to April 2006, discussed supra, and \nused heroin and cocaine one time in about 1974. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.)  \n \nApplicant has worked as a security officer for several employers since at \nleast November 1983. GE 1. Other than his testimony, Applicant did not offer any \nadditional evidence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG & 15: \n \n\n \n5\nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process. \n \nTwo Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 16 could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other government representative. \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s falsifications \nby evidence submitted and his admissions. Together, they warrant application of \nthese disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides for potentially applicable personal conduct mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully \nand truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n6 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying his October 2006 e-QIP response \nregarding his March 2001 foreclosure. In that same e-QIP, Applicant provided false \nresponses regarding his employment record and past drug use, and also false and \nmisleading responses to the OPM Investigator during his November 2006 interview. \nHaving provided conflicting versions of past events, Applicant places the trier of fact in \nthe difficult position of trying to determine when he is being truthful and when he is not \nbeing truthful. Once an Applicant\u2019s credibility has been seriously compromised, it is \ndifficult to accept an Applicant\u2019s testimony at face value. Having evaluated the evidence, \nand observed the Applicant, I do not find him to be credible. \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the Government from evaluating his past \nemployment record, his past illegal drug use, and his past foreclosure history in a timely \nfashion. He further inhibited the process by later lying to an OPM Investigator when \nasked about his employment record and past illegal drug use. Such revelations would in \nall likelihood have raised significant security concerns. In addition, it was not until the \nsecond OPM interview that Applicant disclosed the extent of his employment history \nand past drug use.  \n \nFinally, while Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his 2001 foreclosure in November 2006 \nmay have been forthright, it cannot be considered prompt. While I give Applicant some \ncredit for coming forward, that credit is diluted by other factors to include his other \nfalsifications. Applicants are expected to tell the Government the truth as part of the \nsecurity clearance vetting process. Under the facts of this case, I am unable to apply \nany of the mitigating conditions under this concern. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 31 could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n7 \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nRecord evidence clearly established that Applicant intended to conceal his \nemployment history, illegal drug use, and financial history from the Government and \naffect the course of his background investigation. For a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to \noccur, the falsification must be material. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in \nUnited States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural \ntendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body to which \nit is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d \nCir.2004). \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers to his e-QIP, such answers were \ncapable of influencing the Government to deny him eligibility for a security clearance. \nHis employment history, past drug use, and home foreclosure are sufficiently recent and \nserious to jeopardize his application for a security clearance. His omission from his e-\nQIP is material. Accordingly, Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1 because \nApplicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides for potentially applicable Criminal Conduct Mitigating \nConditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nrequired information, discussed supra, demonstrates lack of candor required of cleared \npersonnel. The Government has an interest in examining all relevant and material \nadverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The \nGovernment relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a \ntimely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. Further, an \napplicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some \nindication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security \nconcerns in the future, something the Government relies on to perform damage \nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct \nsuggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate Government \ninterests. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe security concerning relating to the Guideline for Drug Involvement is set out \nin AG \u00b6 24: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions \nthrough evidence submitted and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable Drug Involvement Mitigating \nConditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation; \nGiven Applicant\u2019s lengthy involvement with drug abuse while in a position of trust \nand responsibility, absence of any rehabilitative evidence, and recent usage, I am \nunable to apply any of the potential mitigating conditions under this Guideline. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n                                                          \nIn all of the security concerns discussed supra, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence and prove a mitigating condition or conditions. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Falsifications are a core security \nconcern. Applicant\u2019s behavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. His misconduct was both recent and frequent. I note Applicant\u2019s drug use began \nin 1973 and continued until 2006, a period of 33 years. He failed to disclose his drug \nuse by falsifying his October 2006 e-QIP, and compounded his first falsification when he \nlater lied to the OPM Investigator about his past drug use in his first interview. I have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s explanation and evidence presented, but that does not \novercome the adverse inferences of his misconduct. Honesty is a core requirement for \nclearance access, and is not a difficult concept to understand or adhere to.  \n \nRehabilitation or behavioral changes are difficult to measure under these \ncircumstances, given the length of time Applicant used drugs when compared to the \nrelatively short time since he quit using drugs. He clearly sought to mislead the \nGovernment about his drug, employment, and foreclosure history, or was at least willing \nto benefit from his misconduct. Applicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead \nof legitimate Government interests increases his potential vulnerability, and he has not \ndemonstrated that the misconduct is unlikely to recur.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant generally admitted the allegations in SOR, with some qualifications and explanation. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 65-year-old principal systems engineer for a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since September 2008 (Tr. 30). He has worked continuously for various federal contractors supporting the intelligence community since November 1981. He was a federal government employee from June 1974 to July 1979 (AX A). He has held a clearance since June 1982 and eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) for more than 20 years (Tr. 29). His current position requires only a secret clearance (AX B). Applicant was married in December 1968 and divorced in August 1975. He remarried in September 1977 and was divorced in December 2001. He has two children, a 39-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son. In September 2004, Applicant used a Euro-Asian on-line dating service to start an email relationship with a 45-year-old citizen of the Republic of China, residing in mainland China. She claimed she worked as an optometrist in a local hospital (Tr. 32). They maintained weekly email contact until April 2005 (GX 2 at 6-7).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 5, 2006. On July 8, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 16, 2008; answered it on August 12, 2008; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nFebruary 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAugust 18, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November 6, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to me on November 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non November 17, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 8, 2008. Applicant \nretained counsel on November 28, 2008, and requested a continuance. On January 5, \n2009, DOHA issued a second notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing for February 2, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \nAX C consists of seven separate documents, which are labeled as AX C-1 through AX \nC-7. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing on February 2, 2009. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant generally admitted the allegations in SOR, \nwith some qualifications and explanation. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old principal systems engineer for a federal contractor. He \nhas worked for his current employer since September 2008 (Tr. 30). He has worked \ncontinuously for various federal contractors supporting the intelligence community since \nNovember 1981. He was a federal government employee from June 1974 to July 1979 \n(AX A). He has held a clearance since June 1982 and eligibility for access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) for more than 20 years (Tr. 29). His current position \nrequires only a secret clearance (AX B). \n \n \nApplicant was married in December 1968 and divorced in August 1975. He \nremarried in September 1977 and was divorced in December 2001. He has two \nchildren, a 39-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old son. \n \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant used a Euro-Asian on-line dating service to start \nan email relationship with a 45-year-old citizen of the Republic of China, residing in \nmainland China. She claimed she worked as an optometrist in a local hospital (Tr. 32). \nThey maintained weekly email contact until April 2005 (GX 2 at 6-7). The woman spoke \nlimited English and used translation software to communicate with Applicant, and he \nlearned some Chinese phrases to communicate with her (GX 2 at 8). At the time, \nApplicant held a top secret clearance with access to SCI (Tr. 32). \n \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant requested approval to travel to Hong Kong to meet the \nwoman. His request was disapproved because of his intended meeting with a Chinese \nnational, and he was advised to terminate all contact with her. He cancelled his hotel \nand airline reservations. He could not obtain a refund of the airfare, about $1,500, but \nhe received a credit for the airfare on another trip. Applicant emailed the woman and \ntold her he could not continue to see her because of his employment. He changed his \nemail address and deleted all the emails and photographs she had sent him (GX 2 at 7; \nTr. 38-39). \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant decided he needed a vacation because of stress at work \nand disappointment about his breakup with the Chinese woman. He requested vacation \ntime from late June to early July 2005, but did not disclose that he intended to visit Hong \nKong (GX 2 at 7). Although he testified he did not schedule the trip in order to meet with \nhis Chinese friend, he emailed her about two weeks before traveling and told her his \ntravel dates and where he would be staying (Tr. 40). At the hearing, he admitted his \nemail was an implied invitation (Tr. 66). He testified he was \u201cfull of fear\u201d on the flight to \nHong Kong because he knew he had done something wrong (Tr. 44). Nevertheless, his \nfriend met him at his hotel and they spent about a week together (Tr. 43). He admitted \nhe did not request approval of his trip because he knew it would be denied (Tr. 58). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a trip report after returning from Hong Kong, but he did not \nreport his contact with his Chinese friend (Tr. 43, 64). He testified he did not disclose \nthe foreign contact because he was \u201cunbelievably full of fear\u201d that he would lose his \nclearance, his job and his career (Tr. 52). His son was starting college, he was caring \nfor his aged mother, and he had financial obligations arising from his previous \nmarriages (Tr. 44). \n \n \nAfter returning from Hong Kong in early July 2005, Applicant proposed marriage \nto the Chinese woman and she accepted. He contacted the chief of security for the \nagency he was supporting and asked if he could obtain a waiver of the restrictions on \nforeign contact if the person contacted was his fianc\u00e9e (Tr. 45). He was informed that \nhe could not continue his foreign contact without giving up his current classified \nassignment. He emailed the woman and informed her that he could not continue their \nrelationship (Tr. 46). She sent one or two more emails to him but he did not respond \n(GX 2 at 9).  \n \n \nIn late July 2005, Applicant\u2019s supervisor informed him that he presented too \nmuch of a security risk to continue working on his assigned project (GX 1 at 28; GX 2 at \n10). He left that employer in September 2005 and found employment with another \nfederal contractor (GX 1 at 16; AX A). \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant submitted an application to continue his clearance. In \nresponse to question 22, pertaining to his employment record, he disclosed he had left \nhis previous job because of the risk presented by his foreign contacts. He explained: \n \nSecurity chief denied my request for foreign travel to Hong Kong due to \nforeign contact. I had completed the Request for Travel and Foreign \nContract Report per policy. Upon trip denial I terminated communication \nwith foreign contact 4/20. By late May-Early June/2005 I realized that I \nneeded a vacation. I replanned the Hong Kong trip without former foreign \ncontact. Due to the small window of time before more tasks would be \nassigned, I scheduled a trip for 6/25-7/4. I should have but did not submit \na Request for Foreign Travel prior to the trip. I submitted the Request in \nthe 1st week upon returning. During the trip I missed foreign contact \n\n \n4 \n \n \nperson. Post trip I emailed her to ask if she wanted to resume our \nrelationship & submit for Fiance Visa. \n \nGX 1 at 28. He intentionally did not mention that he and the \u201cforeign contact\u201d spent the \nweek together in Hong Kong. At the hearing, he admitted his explanation on the security \nclearance application was intentionally incomplete (Tr. 49). \n \n \nIn early September 2006, Applicant received a voicemail message from a female \nChinese medical student in the U.S., conveying a message that his Chinese friend \u201cwas \nstill waiting for him.\u201d Applicant returned the call and told the medical student he could \nnot continue the relationship without losing his job (GX 2 at 9).  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on September 20, 2006, Applicant \nstated he had visited Hong Kong in 2005 \u201cby himself,\u201d that he felt lonely during the trip, \nthat he was worried about not submitting a foreign travel request. He denied contacting \nor meeting his friend while overseas (GX 2 at 8). At the hearing, he testified he was \u201cfull \nof fear\u201d during the interview because he knew his clearance was at risk, and he was not \ncandid about his foreign contact in Hong Kong (Tr. 50).  \n \n \nAt some time in 2007, Applicant\u2019s Chinese friend contacted him by instant \nmessaging. Applicant thought the message was a hoax or a trick and asked her to show \nherself on the video camera, which she did. Applicant told her his situation had not \nchanged, and he had no further contact with her (Tr. 48). Applicant reported the contact \nto his security officer (Tr. 68). \n \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant hired a private polygraph examiner. He made a \nlengthy statement during the examination that was consistent with his testimony at the \nhearing. His motive in arranging for the polygraph examination was to express remorse \nfor his lack of candor about his foreign contacts and to demonstrate that he did not \ndisclose any classified or sensitive material (GX 2 at 25). He provided a copy of his \nstatement in response to DOHA interrogatories asking him to authenticate his statement \nto the security investigator in September 2006, and he pointed out that he had omitted \nmentioning his one-week contact with his friend from China during that interview (GX 2 \nat 16).  \n \n \nApplicant had no further contact with the Chinese woman after the instant \nmessage contact in 2007. He testified he uninstalled the instant messaging software \nfrom his computer and no longer has any communication with anyone in a foreign \ncountry (Tr. 51-52).  \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant married his current wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen. In \nSeptember 2008, he began working for his current employer. According to his current \nsupervisor, he was very candid about the issues surrounding his security clearance and \nhe described the circumstances surrounding his trip to Hong Kong in 2005 in detail (AX \nB). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nA retired Navy officer with 25 years of service, who met Applicant in June 2008 \nwhen he and his then-fianc\u00e9e joined their church, now works with Applicant to establish \nand maintain a men\u2019s ministry. Based on observation of Applicant\u2019s interaction with his \nmother and new wife, the witness believes Applicant is an honest person, willing to be \nbound by conscience and to do what is right (AX C-1). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor since the spring of 2008 describes Applicant as sincere, \nhonest, and dedicated to God, his family, and his country. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cmistakes\u201d and believes they have motivated him to be wiser (AX C-5). Applicant\u2019s \nprevious pastor for four years describes him as responsible, reliable, trustworthy, and \ncommitted to his family (AX C-6). A member of Applicant\u2019s previous church, who is a \nretired Army officer and has known him since 2002, was aware of his foreign contacts \nand believes he is remorseful about his poor judgment and has grown in his religious \nfaith and maturity as a result of his mistake (AX C-7). \n \n \nA former colleague who has known Applicant for three years and holds a top \nsecret/SCI clearance describes him as exceptionally talented and a person of high \nintegrity, honesty, and a strong work ethic (AX C-4). A long-time friend since 1965 \ndescribes Applicant as a person who is honest, mature, responsible, loyal, of high moral \ncharacter, and a deeply religious man who tries to live his faith by example. He believes \nApplicant has been a caring father to his children, and a caring son to his aging mother. \nHe considers Applicant a conservative person, a God-fearing and proud American, and \na fierce patriot (AX C-2). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son describes Applicant as his \u201cbest friend in life.\u201d His father has \ntaught him \u201chumility, responsibility, leadership, determination, respect, love, and \nhonesty.\u201d He describes his father as a family man and a deeply religious person who \nwill stand by his word and fight for what is right (AX C-3). \n \n \nThe Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive reported to Congress in \nSeptember 2008 that a large number of countries target U.S. information and \ntechnology, but that the bulk of intelligence collection is from a \u201ccore group\u201d of fewer \nthan 10 countries, one of whom is China (GX 3 at 1). Foreign collectors target U.S. \ntravelers with a variety of methods, including eliciting information from seemingly \ninnocuous conversations (GX 3 at 4). The 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission states that China operates an aggressive \nclandestine industrial espionage network that is so extensive that China\u2019s espionage \nand industrial theft activities are the \u201csingle greatest risk\u201d to the security of U.S. \ntechnology (GX 4 at 9, 11). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was given a choice in April 2005 of losing his \nclearance or terminating his relationship with a foreign contact, that he briefly broke off \nthe relationship, and that he failed to report that he had resumed the relationship in May \nor June of 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It alleges that, in June and July 2005, he traveled to Hong \nKong without obtaining the approval for foreign travel required by his employer (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). It also alleges two instances of falsification. The first allegedly occurred when he \nsubmitted an application to continue his clearance in July 2006, and disclosed that he \nhad left a job under unfavorable circumstances, but did not disclose that he attempted \nto conceal a foreign contact in Hong Kong (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The second instance allegedly \noccurred during an interview with a security investigator in September 2006 when he \nstated he was laid off for \u201clack of work\u201d by his previous employer and he did not disclose \nthat he had initiated foreign contact during his trip to Hong Kong (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of an on-line dating service to initiate foreign contacts and his \nweekly email contacts with a Chinese national before his trip to Hong Kong in June and \nJuly 2005 are not specifically alleged in the SOR. Thus, this conduct may not be used \nas an independent basis for revoking his clearance. However, conduct not alleged in the \nSOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of the whole person analysis. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the conduct \nnot specifically alleged in the SOR for these limited purposes. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has been eligible to SCI access for many years and listed \nhimself on his resume as \u201cTS/SCI eligible,\u201d the SOR makes no reference to Director of \nCentral Intelligence Directive 6/4, Personnel Security Standards and Procedures \nGoverning Eligibility for Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), which \nwas the controlling directive at the time of the conduct alleged and the date of the SOR. \nThus, this decision is limited to considering whether Applicant\u2019s underlying collateral \nsecurity clearance should be continued. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \nSeveral potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant. The disqualifying \ncondition set out in AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to: \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) applies to \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to: \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies to: \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies to \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about \none's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nsuch as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Finally, AG \u00b6 16(f) applies to \n\u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the \nemployer as a condition of employment.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate concealment of his week-long contact with a citizen and \nresident of mainland China on his security clearance application raises AG \u00b6 16(a). His \nfalse statement to a security investigator that he had no contact with the Chinese \nwoman during his Hong Kong visit raises AG \u00b6 16(b). His intentional and repeated \ncontacts with a Chinese national, while holding a top secret/SCI clearance and working \non a sensitive project, and his intentional concealment of his contacts raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), \n(d), and (e). Finally, his violation of his employer\u2019s rules regarding foreign travel and \nreporting of foreign contacts raises AG \u00b6 16(f).  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a)-(f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant falsified his security application in July 2006, repeated \nthe falsification during an interview with a security investigator in September 2006, and \ndid not correct his omission until he responded to DOHA interrogatories in February \n2008, about 19 months after he submitted his application. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). The first and \nthird prongs of this mitigating condition are not met because Applicant\u2019s intentional \nfalsifications were repeated, and they were not minor.  \n \n \nThe second prong of this mitigating condition (\u201cso much time\u201d) focuses on \nwhether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If \nthe evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant engaged in a 28-month pattern of deception, beginning with his false \ntrip report in July of 2005 and finally ending with his acknowledgment in November 2008 \nthat his earlier statements were false. About 17 months have elapsed since Applicant\u2019s \nlast falsehoods, and only about five months have elapsed since he finally corrected the \nfalse information. Within his family, church community, and the friends who have \nsupported his application, he enjoys a reputation for honesty and integrity. He is no \nlonger looking for companionship in the wrong places. He asserted at the hearing that \nhe uninstalled the instant messaging software from his computer and no longer \nexchanges messages with anyone from a foreign country. What cannot be determined \nis whether he will again resort to falsehood if he believes his clearance and his job are \nin jeopardy. It is significant that his overriding fear while he was involved with a foreign \nnational was not whether he would be exploited and protected information would \ncompromised, but rather whether he would lose his job. He still has substantial financial \nobligations and needs a clearance to keep his current job. Because of his pattern of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nrepeated deceptions motivated by self-preservation, I am not satisfied that enough time \nhas passed to show that he is rehabilitated. \n \n \nNow that Applicant has remarried, it is unlikely that he will engage in further \nromantic relationships with foreign nationals. Thus, I conclude the fourth prong of this \nmitigating condition (\u201cunique circumstances\u201d) is established. However, his bad judgment \nin fostering a romantic relationship with a citizen and resident of mainland China, and \nhis repeated deceptions motivated by fear of losing his job cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude Applicant has not carried his \nburden of establishing AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his behavior and no longer searches for \ncompanionship in foreign countries. While future inappropriate foreign contacts are \nunlikely, Applicant has not persuaded me that future deceptive behavior will not recur if \nhe perceives that his clearance and his job are at risk. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is \nnot established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). This mitigating condition is established because Applicant is married, no longer \nseeks foreign companionship, and apparently has made full disclosure to his new \nemployer.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a well-educated, mature adult, and he has a wealth of experience in \nthe intelligence community. He has provided many years of dedicated service and held \nhigh-level clearances for many years. While his long and faithful service is a mitigating \nfactor, his experience in the intelligence community is a double-edged sword, because \nhis experience should have made him more attuned to the risks to national security \nposed by fostering a romantic relationship with a Chinese national, about whom he \nknew very little. He, more so than others less experienced, should have realized the \ndanger of bypassing the rules designed to protect him from exploitation. He should have \nunderstood the necessity for absolute candor, but he engaged in deceptive behavior for \n28 months because he feared losing his clearance and his job.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Ittig, Esquire \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Foreign  \nInfluence adjudicative guideline.  His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 25, 2006, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-Qip). On March 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 14, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2008.  \nI convened a hearing on August 25, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses, introduced two exhibits (Ex. 1 and 2), and offered \nfacts found in six official documents of the U.S. Government for administrative notice. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1.)  Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 were admitted without objection.  I took notice \nof HE 1.  \n \nApplicant testified on this own behalf and called no witnesses. At the hearing, he \nintroduced six exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A, B, C, D, E, and F and admitted \nwithout objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, at Applicant\u2019s request, I held the \nrecord open until close of business September 2, 2008 so that Applicant could provide \nsupplemental information in response to the amended SOR and additional facts for \nadministrative notice.  Applicant timely filed a response to the amended SOR, which I \nmarked as Ex. G and admitted to the record without objection. He also filed a document \ncontaining facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) which were drawn from \nHE 1. Applicant\u2019s facts for administrative notice were marked HE 2 and included in the \nrecord without objection. DOHA received the transcript (TR) of the hearing on \nSeptember 8, 2008. \n \n                                                     Evidentiary  Ruling \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the evidence, Department Counsel moved, pursuant to DoD \nDirective, Enclosure 3, E3.1.17, to amend the SOR to conform with facts elucidated at \nthe hearing.  Specifically, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the \nfollowing allegations: \n \n1.d.  Your spouse is a citizen of China residing with you in the United \nStates. \n \n1.e.  Your father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of China.  \n \n \nApplicant did not object to amending the SOR to include the new allegations 1.d. \nand 1.e.  He requested additional time to provide supplementary information in \nresponse to the new allegations.  Applicant\u2019s request was approved, and Department \nCounsel\u2019s  motion to amend the SOR was granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe amended SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG B, \nForeign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). In his Answer to the SOR and in his \ntestimony, Applicant admitted all five allegations in the amended SOR and provided \nadditional information.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guideline, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and employed as a computer programmer by a \ngovernment contractor. Applicant was born in China and received a bachelor of science \ndegree in telecommunications from a university in China.  In 1987, he came to the U.S. \non a student visa. He brought with him US $3,000, which his parents and brother had \ngiven him to help with his expenses. He studied at a university for one semester.  He \nleft and attended English classes at a second university for one year.  He studied at a \nthird university and pursued a master\u2019s degree in computer science.  After he found a \njob, he left the university and did not continue his studies.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 56-58, 67, 71, 76, \n78.)  \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant married a woman who was a citizen of China and residing in \nthe U.S. The couple was divorced in April 2001.  Later, at a Chinese New Year\u2019s party \nhe attended in the U.S., Applicant met another woman who was a Chinese citizen and \nresiding in the U.S. as a student.  Applicant and the woman were married in June 2006, \nand they are the parents of a child born in October 2007.1 Applicant\u2019s wife is employed \nas an administrative assistant and accountant.  She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship \nwhen she is eligible to do so.  (Ex. 1; Ex. G; Tr. 43-45, 65, 68-69.) \n \n \n  In 2000, when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant changed his first \nname and his surname. He elected to use an English language first name and an \nEnglish language noun in place of his Chinese surname. (Ex. 1; Tr. 59-60.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, and brother are citizens and residents of China.  His \nparents are 82 and 78 years old. Applicant\u2019s father is retired from a Chinese \ngovernment agency and receives retirement benefits based on his service to that \nagency.  Applicant\u2019s brother owns a computer support business.  Applicant\u2019s bother\u2019s \nwife teaches at a college in China.  Applicant speaks with his parents by telephone once \na month. He also speaks with his brother by telephone about once a month.  Applicant\u2019s \nparents came to the U.S. to visit him in 1999, 2001, and 2003.  (Tr. 37-39, 52-55, 61.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from June 2001 to August 2002.  His unemployed \nstatus caused him to feel frustrated and hopeless.  In January 2002, he traveled to \nChina to visit his parents.  He remained in China with his parents until May 2002.  In \n2003, Applicant used his one-month vacation to travel back to China with his parents, \nwho had been visiting him in the U.S.  In 2005, Applicant traveled again to China to visit \nhis parents.  (Answer to SOR; Tr. 40-41.)  \n \n \n1 Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator in January 2007. The investigator sought \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives.  In that interview, Applicant discussed his relationship with \nhis former spouse, his parents, and his brother.  However, the subject interview does not mention \nApplicant\u2019s second wife or the fact that Applicant married her approximately six months before the \ninterview took place. (Ex. 2.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of China.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is 65 years old and retired from work in real \nestate. His mother-in-law is 60 years old and a retired accountant. Neither of Applicant\u2019s \nparents-in-law worked for businesses owned by the Chinese government.  Applicant\u2019s \nwife speaks with her parents in China by telephone about once a month. (Ex. G at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister is 36 years old and employed as an accountant by a \nwater processing company.  Her husband works as an accountant for a utility company.  \nNeither company is owned by the Chinese government. (Ex. G at 2.) \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant and his wife traveled to China to visit their parents and \nsiblings.  Applicant\u2019s wife traveled on her Chinese passport.  Applicant, his wife, and \nchild stayed in the home of his parents-in-law when they were in China.  Because his \nparents are growing too old to travel to the U.S., Applicant plans to visit them in China in \nthe future.  (Tr. 45-47, 80.) \n \n \nApplicant has no investments in China and owns no property there.  He owns two \ncondominiums in the U.S.  He estimated the value of one condominium at $220,000, \nand he estimated the value of the second condominium at $335,000.  He has two \n401(k) plans, with assets totaling $70,000.  (Tr. 64.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer, chief executive officer, and several senior managers \nprovided letters of character reference for Applicant.  They attested to Applicant\u2019s good \ncharacter, dedication to his duties, professionalism, and trustworthiness.  (Ex. A; Ex. B; \nEx. C; Ex. D; Ex. E.) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about China which appear in \nofficial U.S. government publications: \n \n \nChina has a population of over a billion people and is a large and economically \npowerful country.  The United States is China\u2019s second-largest trading partner, and \nChina is the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner.  The Chinese Communist Party \ndominates the country\u2019s authoritarian government.  China possesses a sophisticated \nmilitary apparatus and strategic nuclear weapons and missiles.  (HR 1; HR 2.) \n \n \nState Department documents chronicle China\u2019s poor human rights practices: \nsuppression of dissent, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, forced confessions, and \nthe mistreatment of prisoners. According to the Department of State publication Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2007 China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and \nMacau,\u201c[Chinese] \nauthorities \nmonitored \ntelephone \nconversations, \nfacsimile \ntransmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communications.  Authorities also \nopened and censored domestic and international mail.  The security services routinely \nmonitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, \nand fax machines.\u201d  (HR 1.)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe U.S. and China have been rivals since the Cold War and disagree on the \nstatus of Taiwan.  China resists what it considers to be the superpower dominance of \nthe U.S.  The Intelligence Threat Handbook states: \u201cThe United States is a primary \nintelligence target of [China] because of the U.S. role as a global superpower, its \nsubstantial military, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role \nas a developer of advanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and \nthe large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime \nintelligence targets by [China].\u201d (HR 1: Interagency Operations Security Information \nSeries (OPSEC) Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official \nUse Only], dated June 2004 at 17.) \n \n \nThe Intelligence Threat Handbook provides the following additional assessments: \n                             \nThe primary operational focus of MSS [China\u2019s Ministry of State Security]  \nis \u201cTaiwan work,\u201d namely conducting intelligence activities against Taiwan \nin every intelligence and covert political action area.  To accomplish its \nobjectives, the MSS also is heavily involved in assessing, developing, and \nrecruiting ethnic Chinese targets. This ethnic recruitment approach to \nsolving intelligence challenges is so pronounced that the Chinese-\nAmerican community, (which is no more than one percent of the total U.S. \npopulation) is the target of an estimated 98 percent of MSS agent \nrecruitment efforts. \n                                            * * * * * * * * * * *   \n[T]he selling point in a normal [Chinese] recruitment operation is not an \nappeal to ethnicity per se, but to whatever feelings of obligation the \ntargeted individual may have towards China, family members in China, old \nfriends in China, etc.  The crux of [China\u2019s] approach is not to try to exploit \na perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help \nChina out in some way.  Whatever the reason, ethnic targeting to arouse \nfeelings of obligation is the single most distinctive feature of [China\u2019s] \nintelligence operations.  [footnote omitted.]   \n \n(HR. 1: Intelligence Threat Handbook, Overview, 20-21.)  \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department also reports that Chinese security agents \u201cmay at \ntimes place foreign visitors under surveillance.  Hotel rooms, telephones, and fax \nmachines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including \ncomputers, may be searched without consent or knowledge of the traveler.\u201d \nAdditionally, \u201cAmericans in China, who are not staying at hotels, including Americans \nwho are staying with friends or relatives, must register with local police as soon as they \narrive.\u201d (H.R. 1: U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information \u2013 China, dated \nDecember 10, 2007, at 2, 9.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative  judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 7(a), AG \u00b6 7(b), and AG \u00b67(d).2  \n \n \nThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China, and China seeks to \nrecruit U.S. citizens of Chinese origin in its efforts to obtain classified information, a \nsituation that threatens U.S. security interests.  American citizens with immediate family \nmembers who are citizens or residents of China could be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, and brother are citizens and residents of China.  \nApplicant\u2019 mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of \nChina. Applicant has a close familial relationship with his parents and brother. He \nspeaks with his parents on the telephone once a month. He traveled to China to visit his \nparents and brother in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2008.  He will likely travel again to China \nto visit his parents, since they believe they are too old to travel to the U.S. to visit him \nand his family.  These facts raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is retired from an agency of the Chinese government. \nApplicant\u2019s familial connection with his father and his father\u2019s former employment by the \nChinese government could create a conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and his desire to help a foreign person or \ngroup in China by providing that information.  Additionally, the potential for a conflict of \ninterest could arise from Applicant\u2019s contacts with other family members who are \ncitizens and residents of China.  This raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 7(b).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, a citizen of China, shares his home. She too has a close \nrelationship with her parents and sister, who are residents and citizens of China.  She \n \n2 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b67(d) reads: \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \nspeaks with them regularly by telephone, and, in April 2008, she traveled with Applicant \nto visit her parents and his parents in China.  These facts also raise security concerns \nunder AG 7(d). \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his wife, parents, brother, father-in-law, mother-in-\nlaw, and sister-in-law are not casual, and his contacts with them are frequent. His \nrelationships are based on long-standing family ties of affection and obligation.  \nApplicant is a devoted husband and dutiful son and son-in-law.  These close \nrelationships raise a heightened risk that Applicant could be targeted for exploitation, \npressure, or coercion by the government of China in ways that might also threaten U.S. \nsecurity interests.  \n \nApplicant offered no evidence to rebut the Government\u2019s assertion that his \ncontacts with his wife, a citizen of China, and his family members and in-laws who are \ncitizens and residents of China created a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nfamily members who are citizens of China could force him to choose between loyalty to \nmembers of his family and the security interests of the United States.  (ISCR Case No. \n03-15485, at 4-6 (App. Bd. June 2, 2005)   I conclude that the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is a mature adult of 50 years of age. He is a college graduate. Over the \ncourse of his adult life, he has been a solicitous and devoted son. He is also a devoted \nhusband, son-in-law, and father.  \n \nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in China. He has numerous immediate \nfamily contacts with China.  His wife, with whom he lives and shares a household, is a \ncitizen of China.  His parents and brother are citizens and residents of China. His father \nis retired from a position in a Chinese government agency. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, \nmother-in-law and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of China.  \n \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by the \nChinese government.  Applicant has traveled to China four times in the past six years, \nthereby exposing himself to the possibility of exploitation, pressure, or exploitation by \nthe Chinese government. Because he is a dutiful son, and because his parents are \ngrowing too old to travel to the U.S. to visit him, Applicant anticipates that he will travel \nto China in the future to visit his parents. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under AG  B.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 19, 2008, admitted all of the allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 9, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on July 24, 2008 scheduling it for August 13, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received five government exhibits, 18 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. At department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of DoD\n5220.22-M, the operating manual governing the National Industrial Security Program\n(NISPOM). DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 25, 2008. Based on a\nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n2\nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old single man with no children. He has lived with his\ndomestic partner for 16 years. He served in the U.S. Army from 1980 until his honorable\ndischarge in 1984 (Tr. 33). He was promoted to the rank of E-5 within 36 months of\nbeing enlisted (Tr. 34). While in the Army, he attended night school, earning a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration (Tr. 18). \nSince leaving the Army, Applicant has worked for various contractors developing\nsoftware, drafting engineering change proposals, and writing computer code (Tr.16-17).\nThe senior vice president of the company where he works characterizes him as \u201cone of\nthe most knowledgeable design developers, and regulatory experts available in the\nentire development community\u201d (Exhibit F). According to his immediate supervisor, he is\nthe best employee who has ever worked for him (Exhibit G). A coworker described him\nas someone with the \u201cutmost integrity in performance of his job, dealings with personnel\nsupervisors, and Government counter parts\u201d (Exhibit E).\nApplicant spends his spare time serving on the board of directors for his\nneighborhood community association, and working with the homeless (Exhibit I). Also,\nhe runs a successful retail business with his domestic partner (Exhibit K). According to a\nneighbor who has lived next to Applicant and his partner for six years, he is a man of\nintegrity and a \u201cmodel neighbor\u201d (Exhibit I).\nIn 1990s, Applicant frequented a public park where gay men congregated,\nlooking to have sexual relations (Tr. 37). This behavior led to a 1990 charge for\nsolicitation, and a 1992 charge for indecent exposure (Answer). He pleaded guilty to\nboth charges, and was fined. He stopped going to the park to engage in this behavior\nafter the second charge (Tr. 39).\nIn May 2003, Applicant was arrested in the bathroom of a local retail store after\nan undercover police officer observed him standing in front of another man and\nmasturbating (Exhibit 5 at 3). Subsequently, Applicant was charged with indecent\nexposure. In October 2003, he pleaded guilty, and was fined, sentenced to one year in\njail, suspended, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service, and to serve three\nyears of probation (Answer). He complied with the requirements of the court order (Tr.\n53). Before the May 2003 incident, Applicant had attempted to engage in sexual activity\nwith strangers on five to six other occasions earlier that year (Tr. 40, 42). He has not\nengaged in such conduct since the 2003 arrest (Tr. 53). \nApplicant attributes his behavior in the early 1990s to the struggle he\nexperienced as a closet homosexual in \u201ccoming out\u201d (Tr. 19). After the 1992 arrest, he\ndisclosed his homosexuality to his friends and family, and the behavior ceased.\n\n3\nApplicant attributes the recurrence of this behavior to the emotional and\npsychological trauma experienced when a major illness precipitated the removal of one\nof his testicles (Exhibit A at 2; Tr. 21). Realizing that he was on a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d\nafter the 2003 arrest, Applicant consulted a therapist, and began treatment in August\n2003. \nApplicant met with the therapist through November 2003 (Exhibits M and N). At\nthat time, the therapist concluded no additional therapy was necessary (Exhibit M).\nAccording to the therapist, Applicant was \u201ctraumatized by the sudden need to have his\ntesticle removed and did not fully appreciate the impact this had on him and his overall\nemotional functioning,\u201d and this led to \u201cmaladaptive decision making\u201d (Exhibit N at 1, 2).\nApplicant was remorseful, interactive, and responsive to therapy (Id.). The therapist\nconcluded that his prognosis was good, and that his risk of re-offending was\n\u201cexceptionally low\u201d (Id. at 1).\nApplicant met with the therapist again in July 2008. After evaluating Applicant,\nand noting that no additional incidents had occurred since 2003, he concluded that his\nmental status was well within normal limits, and his \u201crisk of re-offending is even lower\nnow than it was five years ago\u201d (Exhibit A). In reaching this conclusion, he noted that\n\u201cthe best predictor of future behavior is one\u2019s recent behavior\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant did not report the 2003 arrest to his employer (Tr. 46). He was aware\nthat he had a responsibility to report adverse information, but was ashamed and\nembarrassed (Tr. 48).\nIn September 2007, a security clearance investigator interviewed Applicant and\nprepared a written summary of the interview (Exhibit 3 at 2-3). In approximately\nNovember 2007, the government propounded interrogatories to Applicant (Exhibit 3).\nHe was asked, among other things, to verify the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s interview\nsummary, and to add any additional information that may be relevant to his security\nclearance worthiness. In response, he voluntarily disclosed the incidents from the 1990s\n(Id. at 5-6).\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor and the senior vice president of the company\nwhere he works are both aware of the 2003 incident (Tr. 50). It is unclear from the\nrecord whether Applicant\u2019s employer knew about the early 1990s incidents. Before\nhiring him in 1996, his employer conducted a full background check (Tr. 49). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 12). Here, Applicant\u2019s behavior triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 13\n(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or\nthat reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s episodes of deviant sexual behavior were limited to the early 1990s\nand the spring of 2003. After the 2003 arrest, Applicant sought therapy. After treating\nhim for approximately three months, the therapist diagnosed the problem, commended\nApplicant\u2019s progress, and rendered a favorable long-term prognosis. He reiterated his\nprognosis five years later, when Applicant again consulted him, and emphasized that\nthe passage of time without a recurrence further minimized the possibility of recurrence.\nApplicant lives with his domestic partner. His sexual preference is not a secret,\nas it was in the early 1990s. Although his immediate supervisor and his upper-level\nsupervisor are aware of the 2003 incident, they both wrote strong recommendations.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago . . . that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment, and 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d apply. \nApplicant has mitigated the sexual behavior security concern.\n\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\n1\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\n5\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s conduct represented a severe lapse of judgment. Consequently, the\nconcern set forth in AG \u00b6 15, the introductory paragraph of the Personal Conduct\nGuideline, applies.  Also, Applicant\u2019s failure to report the 2003 arrest to his employer\n1\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information\nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\nsuch as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal\nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d\nApplicant obtained counseling and received an unequivocal recommendation\nfrom his counselor after successfully completing it. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and his\ncompany\u2019s senior vice president are aware of Applicant\u2019s 2003 sexual offense. During\nthe 2007 investigative process, he volunteered information about the offenses that\noccurred in the 1990s, comprehensively addressing them in his interrogatory\nresponses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \u201c . . so much time has passed . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and 17(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nBy participating in high-risk sexual activity in public places, Applicant\ndemonstrated a serious lack of judgment and discretion. The 2003 incident was\n\n6\nparticularly troubling because Applicant demonstrated a disregard not only for the law,\nbut for the propriety of any other department store patron who may have walked, by\nchance, into the bathroom when he was exposing himself. His conduct also generated a\npotential for pressure, coercion, or exploitation that was augmented after he failed to\nreport the 2003 conduct to his employer.\nAfter the 2003 incident, Applicant sought treatment from a therapist, who later\nprovided a favorable prognosis. His immediate supervisor, his company\u2019s senior vice\npresident, and his domestic partner are aware of the 2003 incident, and all\nunequivocally recommend his application for a security clearance. During the\ninvestigative process, he has been forthcoming about the 2003 incident and the\nincidents that occurred in the early 1990s. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct, and the potential for pressure, coercion, or exploitation is outweighed by the\npresence of rehabilitation, and the length of time that has elapsed since the last episode\nof bad conduct. Upon considering the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nthe context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged Applicant owed approximately $39,863 for 11 delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k. Applicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but admitted without explanation all of the remaining allegations. In addition to the facts admitted through his response to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact based on my review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits. Applicant is 36 years old and has been employed as an electronics technician by the same defense contractor since 1996. Before that, he was in the United States Navy. Applicant served as a Cryptologic Technician - Maintenance (CTM) and was a second class petty officer (CTM2; paygrade E-5) when he left the service in 1996 after six years of honorable service. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2) Applicant and his wife were married in 1993 and have four children ranging in age from 6 to 15. But since 1999, he and his wife have been separated more than they have been together. Most recently, Applicant and his wife lived together from about June 2007 until August 2008 because Applicant was severely injured in a motorcycle accident.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn June 1, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86)\nto renew a security clearance required for his job with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue\n1\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. On June 10, 2008, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nOctober 30, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n Applicant has two cars for himself while his wife has her own car, which she pays for. He has no good reason\n3\nwhy he bought a second car. (Tr. 70)\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on July 22, 2008, and I convened a hearing on September 4, 2008. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented seven exhibits (Gx. 1 - 7).\nApplicant testified in his own behalf and presented one witness. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 18, 2008. I left the record open after the hearing to allow\nApplicant time to present additional relevant information. (Tr. 72) The record closed on\nSeptember 29, 2008, when I received five documents from Applicant, which have been\ncollectively admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) A.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $39,863 for 11 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k. Applicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but\nadmitted without explanation all of the remaining allegations. In addition to the facts\nadmitted through his response to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact based\non my review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits. \nApplicant is 36 years old and has been employed as an electronics technician by\nthe same defense contractor since 1996. Before that, he was in the United States Navy.\nApplicant served as a Cryptologic Technician - Maintenance (CTM) and was a second\nclass petty officer (CTM2; paygrade E-5) when he left the service in 1996 after six years\nof honorable service. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2) \nApplicant and his wife were married in 1993 and have four children ranging in\nage from 6 to 15. But since 1999, he and his wife have been separated more than they\nhave been together. Most recently, Applicant and his wife lived together from about\nJune 2007 until August 2008 because Applicant was severely injured in a motorcycle\naccident. They tried to reconcile while he recuperated but their efforts failed. They are\nwaiting for one year to pass before they file for divorce. (Tr. 65 - 67) While separated\nfrom his wife, he has had to support his own residence as well as that of his wife and\nchildren. She is currently employed as an accountant and is better able to support\nherself. Nonetheless, Applicant currently helps support his wife and children by sending\nthem about $1,000 each month. He also pays his own rent, utilities, two car payments3\nand other expenses, all of which total about $1,400. Applicant nets about $3,600 each\nmonth and has a second job that nets him about $600 each month. (Tr. 59 - 60, 66 - 71)\nFrom the information Applicant has provided, I estimate he has as much as $1,800\nremaining each month after expenses.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nWhile Applicant was in the Navy, he was generally assigned to seagoing billets\nand was often away from home. He left the Navy in 1996 because he did not want to be\naway from his wife and children so much. When he accepted civilian employment he\nthought he was getting a raise compared to the taxable income from the Navy, but he\ndid not take into account that he was also paid for housing and other benefits. His\nstarting civilian pay was actually a reduction in pay. This circumstance, coupled with\nApplicant\u2019s admitted irresponsible use of credit cards (Gx. 7; Tr. 63), before and after he\nand his wife first separated in 1999, caused him to amass nearly $40,000 in past due or\ndelinquent debts. (Tr. 38 - 39, 63 - 66)\nApplicant claims he has paid some of the smaller accounts listed in the SOR.\nSpecifically, he claims (Tr. 40) he has paid the medical accounts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\n($111) and 1.I ($181), but did not provide information to support his claim. Since March\n2008, Applicant has been paying $208 each month to Portfolio, a collection agency for\nhis debt to Bank of America (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant also submitted information showing\nhe has made four payments totaling $537 to NCO between February 2008 and\nSeptember 2008. (Ax. A) NCO is the collection agency listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($3,917)\nand 1.h ($7,743). Information suggests and the government concedes that these are the\nsame debt. Accordingly, I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.h for the Applicant.\nApplicant has held a top secret security clearance since he was in the Navy. In\n2002, as part of a previous periodic reinvestigation, Applicant was interviewed about his\ndebts by a Department of Defense investigator. In a signed, sworn statement (Gx. 7),\nApplicant acknowledged his debts were the result of irresponsible spending and poor\nuse of his personal credit. He also averred that he had learned to be financially\nresponsible, that he would seek professional financial advice and counseling to resolve\nhis debts, and that he had \u201cthe financial means and the personal inclination to resolve\n[his] delinquent accounts.\u201d \nApplicant has a good reputation at work. His supervisor of 12 years, who is\nfamiliar with the reasons for the government\u2019s intent to revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance, testified Applicant is reliable, honest, and hardworking. (Tr. 79 - 85) Applicant\nhas been active in his community and church for at least 12 years. He belongs to an\norganization that does charitable work for the handicapped and disadvantaged, he\ncoaches youth sports, and he is an active member of his church. (Tr. 77 - 78)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\n\n5\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin the SOR. Even though SOR \u00b6 1.h appears to be a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.g, and even\naccepting Applicant\u2019s undocumented claim that he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.I, available\ninformation shows Applicant still owes as much as $31,000 for debts that have been\ndelinquent since before 2002. The government\u2019s information requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant presented only minimal proof of payment or efforts to\nresolve his debts. Available information shows the delinquencies listed in the SOR\narose at or before the time of Applicant\u2019s 2002 interview. However, despite his\nstatement in 2002 that he would act to resolve his debts, there is no information\nshowing he made any concerted or organized effort to correct his debts and financial\nproblems until early 2008, when he started paying toward the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.g. \nApplicant also claimed his marital problems caused or contributed to his debt\nproblems. Indeed, AG \u00b6 20(b)(the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) might provide Applicant with some benefit.\nHowever, his inaction for at least six years has not been explained despite the fact it\nappears his positive monthly cashflow should allow him to make more progress than he\nhas shown. Accordingly, Applicant has not satisfied the AG \u00b6 20(b) requirement that he\nhas \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nIn summary, there is no basis in the record to support application of any of the\nother mitigating conditions under this guideline. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to\npresent sufficient information that would mitigate the security concerns raised by the\nadverse information about his finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n6\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 36 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. He has held a security clearance for about 17 years and\nshould be well aware of the need to attend to his finances. He failed to follow through on\nhis 2002 statement to the government that he intended to resolve his debts. Applicant is\na reliable, hardworking employee and is active in support of others in his community.\nHowever, absent information that would show he is making progress on his debts and is\nunlikely to have such financial problems in the future, the favorable information in his\nbackground is insufficient to overcome the security concerns about his lengthy history of\nbad debt. The facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s finances present an unacceptable\nrisk to the national interest were his access to classified information to continue. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s\n8\nfinances shows there are still doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h - 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nApplicant was subsequently granted a security clearance in 1996 and again in 2003.  Government Exhibit 1,\n1\nSecurity Clearance Application, at 33; Department Counsel Brief at 4.  \n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 22, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions was erroneous and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous.  Finding error, we reverse.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Defense\ncontractor and is currently making $61,000 a year.  He seeks to retain a previously granted security\nclearance.\nApplicant failed to file his state and Federal income tax returns in a timely manner for several\nyears between 1982 and 1990.  As a result of this, Applicant was denied a security clearance in\n1993.   \n1\nHe accrued a tax debt to the IRS of $55,000.  He consulted with three different tax resolution\nspecialists and made payments to the IRS.  However, he found repayment of the amount to be\ndifficult.  He received a document from the IRS to the effect that his taxes \u201cwere not collectable at\nthis time.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He also stated that he no longer owed the debt under the statute of\nlimitations.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for efficiency at his job.\nAnalysis\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.20(a): \u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n2\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgement[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.20(c): \u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problems and/or there are\n3\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.20(d): \u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay over due creditors or otherwise\n4\nresolve debts[.]\u201d    \n3\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n2, 2006).\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case.  In doing\nso, he applied three Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions: 20(a) , 20(c),  and 20(d).   In\n2\n3\n4\napplying these mitigating conditions, the Judge focused attention upon the extent to which\nApplicant\u2019s tax debts were not collectible and upon Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts,\nincluding the use of tax resolution firms and attempts to develop payment plans.  Decision at 6.  He\nalso noted that Applicant currently files his returns and pays his taxes.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision did not take into account\nsignificant contrary record evidence.  This argument is persuasive.  The Judge\u2019s decision rested in\nlarge measure upon his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s tax debt had been \u201cforgiven.\u201d  Decision at 6.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s own evidence casts doubt upon this conclusion.  Applicant submitted a letter\nfrom the IRS, for example, in which he was advised that \u201c[y]ou were in a not collectible at this time\nstatus, not never collectible.\u201d  The record contains no further elaboration on the meaning of this\nadvice; however, this letter does not support a conclusion that the IRS had actually forgiven\nApplicant\u2019s tax debt, as the Judge stated.  Furthermore, we note Applicant\u2019s own testimony that the\ndebt is still gathering interest, from which a reasonable person could conclude that the IRS does not\n\nSee Tr. at 31: \u201cQ: Do you have . . . anything to support that claim?  A: No, I do not.  Q: No documentation from\n5\nthe IRS?  A: No, I do not.\u201d  \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-16841 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008)(\u201c[R]eliance upon the non-collectibility of a debt\n6\ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the meaning of the Directive.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No.\n06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007)(\u201c[T]he Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing\nthat a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019\nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy)\nin order to claim the benefit of this [mitigating condition.]\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct.\n26, 2006).\nApplicant testified that he originally got into trouble with the IRS in 1977 and 1978 as a result of his\n7\nemployment outside the U.S.  The IRS notified him that he owed taxes for those years.  \u201cHonestly, I did not properly\nrectify it.  I ended up just ignoring their notifications. . . . Q: And did you decide to stop filing returns altogether for a\nperiod of time?  A: Yes, I did, I think from sometime in the 80's[.]\u201d Tr. at 25 - 26.  \u201cQ:  And do you recall your reason\nfor not filing taxes?  A: Well, it\u2019s not a reason . . . it was stupidity actually.  I thought that they were wrong; that I was\nbeing unduly persecuted, and I just stopped filing my returns.  It was a very, very bad decision, but that was basically\nit.\u201d  \u201cQ: So, you preferred the alternative of just never paying [your tax]?  A: Not a good decision; but, yes.\u201d  Tr. at 38.\n4\nview the debt as having been extinguished.  Tr. at 30-31.  Tellingly, Applicant stated in his response\nto the SOR that the IRS would not seek to collect the monies owed \u201cunless my financial situation\nchanges drastically.\u201d (emphasis added) The record contains no evidence of a written communication\nfrom the IRS absolving Applicant of the $55,000 tax liability or otherwise forswearing some kind\nof collection effort.   Even assuming that judicial enforcement of the debt has been precluded by the\n5\nstatute of limitations, we have consistently held that reliance upon such a remedy is not normally a\nsubstitute for good-faith efforts to pay off debt.   \n6\nWe also note other record evidence, for example Applicant\u2019s testimony and other statements\nto the effect that his tax problems reach as far back as 1977 and that, when the IRS notified him of\nhis tax liability, he simply ignored the warnings.  He further testified that, when faced with mounting\nIRS debt, he elected not to pay his tax.   This testimony is not consistent with Applicant\u2019s claim of\n7\ngood judgement and reliability, nor does it establish that Applicant\u2019s response to his financial\nproblems demonstrates good-faith.  Additionally, Applicant was previously denied a security\nclearance based, in part, upon his tax problems.  Insofar as he was, therefore, on notice as to the\nsecurity significance of these issues, his reliance upon a tenuous theory of debt forgiveness seriously\nundercuts his case for mitigation.  \nTo sum up, there is substantial record evidence that: Applicant became delinquent in his\nFederal taxes due to his own actions, which he himself characterized as foolish; he was denied a\nsecurity clearance in 1993, due in part to his failure to pay his taxes.  Despite this, Applicant\npermitted his tax delinquencies to remain;  Applicant\u2019s plan of addressing these debts was to rely\nupon his view that the tax debt has been forgiven.  The record contains no corroboration for\nApplicant\u2019s assertion that the IRS has forgiven the debt.  The debt is, in fact, increasing through the\naccrual of interest.  The record does not support a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated the\n\n5\nsecurity concerns arising from his tax delinquencies.  Under the facts of this case, we conclude that\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable, because it fails to consider an important aspect of\nthe case and that it offers an explanation for the decision that is contrary to the weight of the record\nevidence.  ISCR Case No. 03-22861, supra.   As a consequence, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is not sustainable upon this record.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a public trust position application, Standard Form 85P (SF \n85P), on May 9, 2007. On June 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 5, 2008, and October 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested her case be decided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 18, 2008.  The FORM was forwarded to \nApplicant on December 23, 2008.  Applicant received the FORM on January 2, 2009. \nShe submitted a response to the FORM on February 10, 2009. Department Counsel \nnoted they did not object to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM on February 18, 2009.   \nThe FORM was forwarded to the hearing office on February 20, 2009, and assigned to \nMarch 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nme that same date.   Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 9, 2008, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b and 1.c. Based on her answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a, I conclude she denies the \nallegation under Guideline E. (Item 5)   \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a position of public trust. She has been employed with the defense contractor \nsince May 2007. (Item 6)   \n \nOn May 9, 2007, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, \nSF 85P.  She answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 20, \u201cAre you now over 180 days \ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or \nguaranteed by the Federal Government.)\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts: \na $14,626 amount owed towards an automobile loan placed for collection in March 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 7 at 4; Item 9 at 5; Item 10 at 2); a $3,761 student loan account placed \nfor collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 7 at 4; Item 9 at 5; Item 10 at 2); and a \n$12,098 student loan account placed for collection in December 2006. (Item 7 at 5: Item \n10 at 2) \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that she did not list her delinquent \naccounts that were over 180 days old (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c) in response to question 20 on \nher trustworthiness application because she did not understand the question. (Item 5.)  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s car was stolen. It was found totaled three weeks later. After \nthe insurance claim was paid, she still owed $7,000 on her automobile loan. She claims \nthat she was unable to make payments due to unemployment. In February 2008, she \ninitially entered into an agreement to repay the automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Her first \npayment was due on March 20, 2008. She provided no proof that she actually made \npayments in accordance with the agreement. (Item 10 at 3) \n \nApplicant owes two student loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.c) for a two year \njunior college program she attended from 1994 to 1996. She made monthly payments \non the loans until she lost her job in 2002. Applicant intends to pay off her loans, but \ndoes not know when she will be able to afford to make monthly payments towards these \naccounts. (Item 9 at 5)  \n \nAs of March 1, 2008, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income was $999.49. Her monthly \nexpenses were $1,497.83. She also paid $508 per month to three creditors not alleged \nin the SOR. She has a negative monthly balance of $1006.34. (Item 10 at 5) \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn March 3, 2007, Applicant separated from her husband and relocated to \nanother state. She and her husband are in the process of divorce. She is trying to do \nthe right things but does not make much money. (Item 10 at 8; Applicant\u2019s Response to \nFORM)  \n \nApplicant was unemployed from December 28, 2006, to May 9, 2007. (Item 6 at \n2) Although she claims she was unemployed in 2002, her job employment history in \nresponse to question 6 on her public trust position application indicates that she was \ncontinuously employed from May 1, 2000, to December 28, 2006. (Item 6) \n \nA credit report dated December 18, 2008, revealed three medical accounts that \nwere placed for collection in the amounts of $336, $511, and $397; and a $492 credit \ncard account that was charged off in May 2008. (Item 12) These accounts became \ndelinquent after the SOR was issued.   \n \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant states that she is trustworthy. She has \nworked for over 40 years and does not have a criminal background. She has \nexperienced financial hardship since separating from her husband and moving to \nanother state.  She will try to seek help with a debt counselor.  She intends to clean up \nher debts once her divorce is final. (Response to FORM)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information and/or a position of public trust will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks a position of public trust enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation by granting a position of public trust. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Between 2002 and 2006, Applicant \nincurred three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $30,485. She is incapable of \nrepaying these obligations because her expenses are approximately $1,000 more than \nher current monthly income. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has been unable to enter into repayment agreements pertaining to her \ndelinquent accounts. She continues to incur additional delinquent accounts. Her \nfinancial situation is unstable.  \n  \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) is considered because Applicant was \nunemployed for five months prior to being hired at her current place of employment in \nMay 2007. She is in the process of divorcing her husband. However, she has not taken \nsteps to resolve any of the delinquent accounts. She did not make payments towards \nthese delinquent accounts when she was employed full-time between 2002 to 2007. It \ncannot be concluded that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. FC MC \n\u00b620(b) does not apply.   \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling.  It is unlikely \nthat her financial problems will be resolved in the near future based on that fact that she \nhas negative monthly balance of $1,000 each month, and she incurred several new \ndelinquent accounts after the SOR was issued.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant indicates that she \nintends to resolve these accounts, but has not entered into any repayment plans with \nthe creditors who own the delinquent accounts. While she entered into a repayment \nagreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a in February 2008, she provided no additional \nevidence indicating that she was making payments under this agreement.  I cannot \nconclude that Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve her overdue accounts.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation remains a trustworthiness concern. She has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list her  \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old in response to question 20 on her public \ntrust position application, SF 85P, dated May 9, 2007. Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nCondition \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) potentially applies to this allegation. Applicant claims that she did not \nanswer \u201cyes\u201d in response to this question because she misunderstood the question. I \nfind Applicant did not deliberately withhold this information when filling out her \napplication for a position of public trust. I find for Applicant with respect to the personal \nconduct concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \nabout her work performance. At the close of the record, Applicant provided little \nevidence that she has taken steps to resolve her delinquent accounts. No plans were in \nplace to resolve the delinquent accounts, and it is unlikely Applicant will be able to \nresolve these accounts in the future because her monthly expenses are more than her \nmonthly income.  Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\n\ndecision under Guidelines H, E and J is sustainable.\nThe Judge found as follows:  Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor.\nHe graduated from high school in 1982 and then he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in November of\nthat year.  When he retired in 2003, he was a master sergeant.  He is married and has held a top-\nsecret security clearance for more than 20 years.  He has been with his current employer since June\n2007.  \nApplicant received numerous medals and commendations while in the military.  He received\nspecialized training and attended the USAF NCO Academy in 1995, 1998 and 1989.  During his\ncareer, he was promoted and given monetary recognition for his efforts.  When he transitioned into\nthe civilian work world, he obtained a civilian job with the federal government.  \nIn March 1986, while in the military, Applicant received a non-judicial punishment for the\nWrongful Use of Marijuana after testing positive during a drug urinalysis.  He was reduced in rank\nand ordered to forfeit $400.  He denied any use of drugs.  He was counseled by an Air Force\nphysician due to the Article 15 on March 28, 1986.  At that time, he held a top secret clearance.  \nIn October 2006, Applicant tested positive for cocaine during a random drug testing at his\nplace of employment.  He was referred to an Air Force drug and alcohol program, but he denied the\nuse of any drug.  He held a top secret clearance at that time.  Applicant resigned from his\nemployment on January 19, 2007.  \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on July 31, 2007.  He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto section 22 (your employment record), which has four questions concerning circumstances or\nunfavorable reasons that a person may have left employment.  Applicant also responded \u201cno\u201d to\nsection 24(b) (use of illegal drugs and drug activity at any time).  He did not note the fact that he\nused cocaine in October 2006 and marijuana in 1986, both times while holding a top secret\nclearance.  Thus, he failed to list his use of illegal drugs.\nThe Department of Defense interviewed Applicant in September 2007 as part of his security\nclearance investigation.  Applicant told the interviewer that he left his job in 2006 because he did\nnot relish the commute and the congested tunnel traffic.  He also commented that his wife\u2019s\ngrandmother died and he needed to handle matters in that arena.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that after the October positive test result, he cooperated\nwith the command.  In November and December he was on paid administrative leave.  He felt after\nthe intervening months of not being in his position that he would consider leaving for a number of\nreasons.  He consulted with his wife and decided to leave.  He noted that his boss had retired.  He\nfelt that perhaps his reputation was tarnished and that his authority might be diminished.  He also\nnoted the traffic congestion as another reason to leave.  In sum, he believed he would no longer be\neffective in his position.  \nApplicant described the testing procedure for the drug program to the investigator.  He\nexplained in great detail that the drug program was new and that he had helped implement the\nprogram.  Applicant remarked that the restroom was dirty and the urinal and sink were taped up.  He\n\nrecalled taking the test and returning the specimen.  \nApplicant elaborated at the hearing that he received a phone call on October 30, 2006, a few\ndays later, from the physician at the test lab that was out of state.  He was informed that the test was\npositive for cocaine.  The physician asked questions about his health and did Applicant have any\nrecent dental work.  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d and also informed the doctor that he had not used\ncocaine.  Applicant was given an opportunity at that point to request a recheck of the sample.  The\nfee was $150.  Applicant had 72 hours to decide if he wanted this done.  Applicant declined the\noffer.\nApplicant testified that on October 31, 2006, he told his captain that he had been in the Air\nForce for 20 years and that he had not used cocaine.  Applicant claimed that the captain filed a\ncomplaint against the lab for calling Applicant directly instead of calling the Command. \nApplicant\u2019s current employer rates him as a successful contributor. He is a competent\nperformer and valued team player. He is valued for his leadership qualities.  Decision at 2-3.\nOn appeal, Applicant gives a detailed summary of the testimony that he provided at the\nhearing, reiterates that he has not used drugs, and asserts that the positive drug tests to the contrary\nare erroneous.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport  such a conclusion in light of all the contrary  evidence in the same record.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\n\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR\nallegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board\ndoes not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a\n\u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of\nthe United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington\nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines H, E and J is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 16, 2008. He requested a\nreview on the record but on April 22, 2008, Applicant requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. I received the case assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 30, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June\n20, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-4, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit A without\nJuly 11, 2008\n\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 30, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received April 16, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR. He denied all other allegations. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1982 and then he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in November of that year.\nWhen he retired in 2003, he was a master sergeant (Tr. 20). He is married.

He is a\ncompetent performer and valued team player. He is valued for his leadership qualities\n(AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\n\n5\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. AG & 25(b) \u201ctesting positive for\nillegal drug use\u201d is another disqualification. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying. Finally under AG\n25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d is a disqualifying\ncondition.  Applicant tested positive for marijuana in 1986 and in 2006, he tested\npositive for cocaine. During both time frames he had a top secret clearance. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\n2006 positive test result for cocaine and his denial of use casts doubt on his\ntrustworthiness. I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n6\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative\nI have considered all the facts and find Applicant deliberately omitted, concealed,\nmislead, and falsified information on security clearance application and at the hearing\nwith respect to his answer to section 24(b). He answered the question \u201cno.\u201d He\ndeliberately failed to indicate that he tested positive for cocaine in 2006 while holding a\ntop secret clearance and failed to indicate that he tested positive for marijuana in 1986\nwhile serving in the military possessing a security clearance.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to section 22 (employment record). Applicant explained\nthat he left his position in January because he felt he would no longer be an effective\nleader. He also mentioned the difficult commute. He was on paid leave for two months\nduring the investigation. I do not find that the government has proved through this\nomission a deliberate falsification.\nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30, \u201dCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulation.\u201d\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 31(a) an \u201csingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be potentially\ndisqualifying. Also AG 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d is a\npotential disqualifying condition.\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification with respect to question 24 constituted a\nviolation of 10 U.S.C. \u00a71001 and is sufficient to raise the disqualifying condition under\ncriminal conduct.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a) the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 30(d) it may be mitigating where \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nFor the reasons discussed above, I do not find that Applicant has provided\nmitigation under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant served in the Air Force for\nmore than 20 years. He received numerous award and decorations.  Applicant held a\ntop secret clearance during that time period. He has no incidents or issues with\nprotecting information. However, in 1986, while holding a clearance, he tested positive\nfor marijuana. He denied the use.\nApplicant successfully transitioned to a position with a federal government in\n2006. He was in line for a promotion. He helped develop a drug testing program,\nHowever, he tested positive for cocaine in October 2006. He denied use of cocaine. He\nchose not to have the test examined again because he claimed he did not want to pay\nthe $150 fee and that the lab did not follow proper procedures. He remained on paid\nadministrative leave for several months and then resigned.\nDespite the excellent military record and his current employer\u2019s recommendation,\nI find that the two positive test results and the deliberate omission of that information on\nhis 2007 security clearance leave me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s credibility.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement, personal conduct and criminal conduct. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines G and J\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 14, 2008\n\nItem 2 (Response to SOR) at 1; Response to FORM at 1.\n1\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SF-86)) at 2; Item 8 (Interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s answer\n2\nwith attachments) at I-10-11, I-24).\nItem 4, supra note 2, at 1, 3-5, Item 8, supra note 2, at I-20 to I-31; Response to FORM at 2, 13-14.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 25, 2008. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on July 9, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on August 21, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nAugust 26, 2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a response and\nadditional evidence on September 22, 2008. DOHA assigned this case to me on\nSeptember 24, 2008. The government submitted eight exhibits, which have been\nmarked as Item 1-8 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has\nbeen marked and admitted as Item 2. His response and attachments to the FORM are\nadmitted into evidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 9, 2008, Applicant admitted all the factual\nallegations in the SOR. In his response to the FORM, he modified his answer to the\nallegation in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR to a denial in part, with explanation. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 59 years old, works as an aircraft electrician and mechanic for\na Department of Defense contractor. He has held this position since March 2001. His\nwork teammates nominated him for team player of the month a year ago. He is their 6S\nprogram representative. A co-worker describes him as hardworking, reliable and\ndiligent. He states that because he is their 6S representative, for five months in a row,\nhis team aircraft received the highest ratings of the aircrafts in the plant, a difficult\nobjective to obtain.2\nApplicant married his first wife in 1969 and they divorced in 1979. They had five\nchildren who range in age from 32 to 39. His father died in 1983. He married his second\nwife in 1985 and they divorced in 1997. They had two children, who are 26 and 19.\nApplicant served in the United States Army for 28 years. During this time, he served in\ndesert storm. In February 1991, while he was overseas, his 40-year-old sister died of\ncancer. He received three Army Commendation medals in the 1990s. He completed a\ntechnical training course in 1999 and plans to enroll in a local community college in\nJanuary 2009.  \n3\n\nItem 1 (Statement of reasons (SOR)); Item 2, supra note 1, at 2.\n4\nItem 5 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal records, dated\n5\nDecember 22, 2004) at 3; Item 8, supra note 2, at I-4 - I-5; Response to FORM, at 1-2.\nItem 6 (Grand Jury indictment on child abandonment and court order); Item 7 (Second Grand Jury indictment\n6\nand motion to dismiss with signed order); Item 8, supra note 2, at I-3.\nItem 6, supra note 6, at 9; Item 8, supra note 2, at I-10, I-13 through I-22; Response to FORM at 5-14.\n7\n3\nIn June 1988, the police arrested and charged him with injury to a child. The\ncourt sentenced him to six months probation. The record contains no other information\non this incident, which Applicant admitted.4\nIn January 1993, the police arrested and charged Applicant with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI). The court fined him and sentenced him to one year of probation. He\nhas little recall about this incident and the record contains no other information. After\nthis arrest, Applicant used alcohol two times to intoxication. He rarely drank alcohol, but\nwhen he did, it was beer. He had no pattern of alcohol use on a regular basis, but at\ntimes used alcohol to cope with stressors in his life, particularly the death of his father\nand sister.5\nIn July 2006, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and her two young children visited him from\nanother city. He and his girlfriend drank four to five beers at his house. He then drove\nhis girlfriend and her children around his city to show it to them. At some point, he\nstopped at a bar. He and his girlfriend went inside and had a beer, leaving the children\nin the car. Thirty minutes later they left the bar. On his way home, the police stopped\nhim, then arrested him for DUI and placed him in jail. The police released him the next\nday after his bond has been paid. The grand jury indicted him for two counts of\nabandoning a child and two counts of DUI with a child passenger on October 4, 2006.\nApplicant self-reported this incident. Applicant pled guilty to the two counts of\nabandoning a child on April 11, 2007. In its Order dated April 11, 2007, the court\ndeferred adjudication on Applicant\u2019s guilty plea and placed Applicant on four years of\nprobation and fined him $400. The court order provided an extensive list of conditions\nfor Applicant while on probation, including attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) twice a\nweek, totally avoiding the consumption of alcohol, performing 300 hours of community\nservice within 24 months, attending an advanced DUI program, and periodic,\nunscheduled blood and urinalysis testing. The prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss the\ntwo DUI counts, and the court signed the Order granting the motion on April 11, 2007.6\nIn the 18 months since his court appearance, Applicant paid the $400 fine,\ncompleted the 300 hours of community service by September 2007, and completed the\nrepeat offender program that same month. He began attending AA on May 30, 2007\nand continues to attend meetings at least twice a week. He no longer drinks and his\nalcohol test results have been negative. His probation officer states he is in compliance\nwith the terms of his probation. He is hopeful for an early release from probation.7\n\nResponse to FORM at 2, 4.\n8\nId. at 3.\n9\n4\nOn August 29, 2008, Applicant sought additional counseling with a licensed\nprofessional counselor. As part of the clinical assessment process, the counselor\nperformed a SASSI-II test, which is a screening tool designed to evaluate chemical\ndependency. Based on this test and his assessment, the counselor concluded that\nApplicant was not chemical dependent. Rather, he fell into the substance abuse\ncategory, which indicates \u201ca maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to recurrent\nand adverse consequences.\u201d The counselor concluded that Applicant used excessive\ndrinking to deal with life stressors. Applicant is now working with the counselor on\ndeveloping improved coping skills and strategies to deal with difficult issues. Since\nmeeting with his counselor, Applicant has decided to enroll in college and has retained\nthe services of a former teacher to tutor him in math and English.8\nApplicant now attends church regularly. His finances are well-managed. He\nattends work daily and regularly works overtime.   \n9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing disqualifying conditions may be applicable in this case:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; or\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence.\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant twice with DUI, with the second\ncharge including the additional information of driving with a child passenger. The police\n\n6\nalso charged him with child abandonment at the time of his second DUI arrest.\nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits do not reflect habitual consumption of alcohol. However, his\nsecond arrest indicates binge drinking on that date. A licensed professional counselor\nrecently diagnosed him with substance abuse related to his past alcohol consumption.\nThe government has established its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a), (c) and (d).\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and the\nfollowing mitigating conditions may be applicable in this case:\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; or\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n \nApplicant has acknowledged that he used alcohol at times to cope with stressors\nin his life. As a result of his last DUI arrest, he began attending AA and completed the\nstate\u2019s re-offender program. While his attendance at these programs is a requirement of\nhis probation, he recently took an additional step to help resolve his issues with alcohol.\nHe hired a counselor to help him with understanding the stressors in his life which\ncompel him to use alcohol. By so doing, he has recognized the impact of alcohol in his\nlife, an impact he wishes to change. He has already taken steps to establish long-term\ngoals for himself by hiring a tutor so that he can return to school for further educational\ntraining. He has no history of previous treatment and relapse. He is making very\nsatisfactory progress with his treatment and understanding of the effect of alcohol on\nhim. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his alcohol use\nidentified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c. under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 (b) and (c).\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\nApplicant has twice been charged with DUI, one including driving with a child\npassenger. In addition, the grand jury charged him with two counts of child\nabandonment at the same time it charged him with two DUI counts. He is currently on\nprobation for his guilty plea to child abandonment. He acknowledged being charged with\ninjury to a child in 1988 and placed on probation for six months. The government has\nestablished its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c) and (d).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; or\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nThe 1988 charge of child injury occurred 21 years ago. The exact circumstances\nsurrounding this incident are unknown. What is known is Applicant has not been\ncharged with a similar crime since 1988 and there is little likelihood of a reoccurrence.\nHe has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns regarding this criminal charge\nunder AG \u00b6 32 (a).\nApplicant\u2019s first DUI arrest occurred over 15 years ago. Because he has been\narrested a second time for DUI, there is an appearance of a pattern of conduct which\nmust be addressed. The large gap of time between his two arrests reduces significantly\nthe argument that he has a pattern of conduct.  His alcohol use during this 15 years was\nlimited and sporadic. Since his last arrest, he has not consumed alcohol. He has sought\nto understand the reasons for his use and is making progress towards complete\nrehabilitation. He goes to church regularly, works every day and takes on overtime\nassignments. He is a good employee. He has plans to go to school in January 2009. He\ncontinues to attend AA, which lead to his seeking further understanding of his alcohol\nuse, which is the reason for his criminal charges. He has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns raised in allegations 2.a and 2.b of the SOR about his alcohol\n\n8\nconsumption and its related criminal charges under AG  \u00b6 32 (d). Because he remains\non probation, he has not mitigation the government\u2019s security concerns raised in SOR \u00b6\n2.c.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s first arrest occurred 20\nyears ago, when he was 39 years old. The circumstances surrounding this arrest are\nunknown, but Applicant has not been involved in similar conduct in the last 20 years.\nHowever, his use of alcohol since 1988, even though sporadic, has created additional\ncriminal problems for him. Two years ago, he consumed beer to excess then drove his\ngirlfriend and her minor children around his community in his car. His conduct placed\nthe children in a situation of potential harm and showed poor judgment. \nFollowing his indictment for this conduct and his decision to plead guilty to two\ncounts of child abandonment, Applicant has changed his focus on alcohol consumption.\nApplicant has realized the seriousness of his conduct in 2006 and taken action to\nchange both his behavior and attitude about alcohol consumption. He has complied with\nthe terms of his probation, which includes attending AA twice a week. Because of his\nparticipation in AA, he recently hired a counselor to help him address his issues related\nto alcohol use. The counselor did not diagnose Applicant as alcohol dependent, but\nindicated that Applicant can use alcohol when stressed. Through counseling, he plans\nto better understand his relationship with alcohol, which will reduce and prevent a\nreoccurrence of his past conduct. Applicant has undergone significant behavioral\nchanges in the last two years as related to his alcohol use. He is and has been a good\nemployee for the last seven years, and is respected by his co-workers. His finances are\nwell-managed. He has set new educational goals for himself. In sum, instead of allowing\n\n9\nhis recent arrest to negatively impact his life, he has chosen to use it as a catalyst to\nchanging his lifestyle and improving his future. \nThe actions taken by Applicant in the last 18 months reflect change in his\nbehavior and attitude. He has demonstrated that he can take responsibility for his\nconduct. One problem continues, which impacts my ability to grant him a clearance. He\nstill remains on probation and will for some time. He anticipates that he maybe released\nfrom probation early, but has no idea when he may be released. Thus, until he is\nreleased from probation, he has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns and\ncannot be granted a clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, but has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns related to his alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

These complaints included allegations of inappropriate relationships, as well as\ninappropriate touching and hugging of female coworkers in the job site.\u201d  Applicant was informed that subsequent\ninfractions could result in job termination.  This exhibit also includes another memorandum by the same person,\ndescribing in detail his counseling session with Applicant.  This memo describes objectively offensive behavior,\nincluding unwanted touching of female workers, sexually suggestive comments, etc.  According to this document,\nApplicant denied being able to recall the incidents alleged against him, nor could he explain why others would make\nthese kinds of accusations against him.  \u201c[Applicant] said he was sorry, but there were no obvious attempts to admit any\nwrong doing[.]\u201d\nGE 15 is a memorandum from the Assistant Deputy Administrator of Employee B, advising Applicant that he\n2\nwas being terminated prior to the conclusion of his probationary period.  This document states that the reason for the\ntermination was \u201cunacceptable conduct and performance,\u201d including \u201crude and abrupt behavior with coworkers,\u201d\n\u201ccontinued demonstration of disrespect for coworkers,\u201d and unacceptable job performance.  It also stated that Applicant\nhad been provided feedback on his poor conduct, without improvement.  GE 15 contains a receipt acknowledgment\nsigned by Applicant.  In a Personal Subject Interview summary included in GE 7, Response to Interrogatories, Applicant\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 16, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Government had not met its burden of production and whether the Judge\u2019s\napplication of the mitigating factors was erroneous.  Finding error, we reverse.  \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a data analyst for a federal\ncontractor.  He has two sons, ages 16 and 11.  He served in the Army from 1994 until 1999.  \nApplicant began to work for Employer A, a federal contractor, in 2002.  During the course\nof the employment, Employer A counseled Applicant for violating its standards of conduct by\nengaging in sexual harassment, inappropriate touching, inappropriate comments, etc.  Employer A\nsubsequently terminated Applicant based on this conduct.1\nApplicant then went to work for Employer B, a federal agency.  He completed a Declaration\nfor Federal Employment (DFE), which inquired, inter alia, whether, within the previous five years,\nhe had ever been fired from a job for any reason.  He answered \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant \u201crushed through his\nanswers.  He thought it meant federal jobs only.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Employer B terminated Applicant\n\u201cbased on unacceptable conduct and performance.\u201d   Id. \n2\n\nacknowledged having been counseled while working for Employer B because a customer had complained about him.\n\u201cHe stated that the only problems he had at [Employer B] were people demanding things of him that he could not obtain\nfor them, problems with organizing travel and all of the various factors involved in that, and other customer service\nrelated problems.\u201d     \nBoth DFEs contain identical language: \u201cDuring the last 5 years, have you been fired from any job for any\n3\nreason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of\nspecific problems, or were you debarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other\nFederal Agency?\u201d  GE 3, 4.  \nSee GE 7, Response to Interrogatories: \u201c[Applicant] admitted that he was terminated from his position at\n4\n[Employer C] due to unsuccessful completion of the probationary period . . . It was just a bad fit.\u201d    \n3\nIn September 2004 Applicant began working for Employer C, also a federal agency.  He\ncompleted a second DFE in which he again answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about whether he had ever\nbeen fired from a job.  Applicant stated that he had rushed through the form and believed that he did\nnot have to list terminations that occurred during a probationary period.   Approximately one year\n3\nlater, Employer C terminated Applicant.  Applicant was advised that \u201che was not meeting the work\nguidelines for his position.\u201d   Id.\n4\nApplicant subsequently began working for Employer D.  He resigned from this employment\nto take a position with his current employer.  \nIn January 2006, Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA).  In answering\nthe question inquiring if he had been fired from a job within the prior seven years, the Judge found\nthat Applicant listed his termination by Employer A, but not B or C.  In response to other questions\non the SCA, he did not list his two sons, and he denied any outstanding debts.  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\n\nIn her discussion of Applicant\u2019s resignation from Employer D, the Judge noted GE 17, Status Change Notice,\n5\nwhich refers to difficulties Applicant was having with his job.  Included in this document is an email from an Operations\nDirector at D:  \u201cI kindly gave him the option to resign before I fired him for poor performance.  After he was fired, an\nex-girlfriend of his replied to all on an email he had sent from his [official] account that accused him of some negative\nthings.  The man is not to be trusted.\u201d  The Judge stated that, because this email was sent out after the fact, and was based\non hearsay from Applicant\u2019s girlfriend, it was entitled to little weight.  Accordingly, she concluded that the Government\nhad not met its burden of production as to Applicant\u2019s resignation from Employer D.  However, GE 7, Response to\nInterrogatories, includes a summary of an interview in which Applicant addressed this resignation.  \u201cRegarding his\n4\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006). \nThe Judge concluded that the Government had not met its burden of production as to the\nalleged deliberate nature of the omissions.  She also concluded that the Government had not met its\nburden regarding an allegation that Applicant resigned from Employer D in lieu of termination for\npoor performance.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions do not take into account\nsignificant contrary record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  \nWhen an applicant denies an allegation contained in a SOR, the Government must produce\nsubstantial evidence of the truth of the allegation.  Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  In the case of an omission in a SCA\nor some other document, the Government\u2019s burden of production requires more than merely showing\nthat the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  Rather,\nthe Government must present substantial evidence that the omission was deliberate.  In evaluating\nwhether the Government has met its burden of production concerning an omission, the Judge must\nexamine the omission in light of the record as a whole.  See ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSep. 26, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect that she took into account record evidence\nthat is not consistent with the view that Applicant\u2019s omissions on the SCA and the two DFEs were\ninnocent.  For example, the record contains evidence that, as regards Applicant\u2019s dismissals from\nEmployers A, B, and C, and his resignation from D,  the circumstances underlying these actions\n5\n\nemployment with [Employer D] [Applicant] was confronted with the unfavorable information [obtained during the\ninvestigation]. . .  He explained that he never knew there was a problem or that his behavior was considered disrespectful\n(particularly in regards to his contact with female coworkers) until he was spoken to approximately two months after he\nbegan working there . . . that his behavior was bordering on sexual harassment . . . Regarding the unapproved email he\nsent out, he thought that it was acceptable to send out the email without having his worked checked . . .\u201d  This interview\ncorroborates the email contained in GE 17 and provides a strong reason to believe that, at the time he resigned from\nEmployer D, Applicant was aware of deficiencies in his conduct and performance.  The interview undercuts the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that the Government had not met its burden of production that Applicant resigned from Employer D under\nunfavorable circumstances and that he had not intended to deceive when he omitted that incident from his SCA.\nSee e.g., Tr. at 54-55.\n6\nTr. at 101-102.\n7\nSee Tr. at 80.  See also Department Counsel Brief at 12: \u201c[A]t the hearing Applicant also claimed, for the first\n8\ntime, that when he read the [DFEs] he misunderstood Question 12 as requiring disclosure of only Federal jobs.\u201d  \nSee Subject Personal Interview summary included in GE 7: \u201cHe did not realize that he needed to list his\n9\nchildren (both of whom were born out of wedlock) on the case papers.\u201d  The implication is that Applicant believed he\ndid not need to list his two children, due to their illegitimacy, which suggests that he gave the question some degree of\nreflection.  This is not totally consistent with his testimony that it was an inexplicable mistake.  \n5\ninclude poor job performance, failure to obey standards of conduct, etc.  Indeed, the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant was previously disciplined by Employer A for the same conduct which\nresulted in his termination.  This record evidence supports a conclusion that the circumstances\nunderlying the dismissals from Employers A, B, and C and the resignation from Employer D were\nnot favorable to Applicant.  A reasonable person could conclude that they supply Applicant with a\nmotive to prevent their discovery and, therefore, a motive for deliberately omitting them from the\nGovernment documents in question.  That the Judge did not address this evidence undermines her\nconclusion that the Government had not met its burden of production.\nAdditionally, the record contains some apparently inconsistent statements by Applicant,\nwhich undermine the credibility of his claims that his omissions were not deliberate.  For example,\nhe variously attributed his omissions of the job firings to his having rushed through the documents,6\nto his belief that he did not have to list terminations that occurred during probationary periods,  and,\n7\nregarding the DFEs, to his mistaken opinion that he only needed to address firings from federal jobs.8\nConcerning his having omitted his sons from the SCA, during the hearing Applicant stated that this\nwas a \u201cbone-headed\u201d mistake which shouldn\u2019t have happened.  However, during a prior interview,\nApplicant advised the investigator that he did not realize that he needed to list his children, which\nreasonably implied that he had made a considered decision not to do so.   The Judge\u2019s decision does\n9\n not sufficiently address Applicant\u2019s inconsistencies, either by attempting to resolve or explain them,\nor by attempting to demonstrate that they are relatively insignificant.  This undermines her favorable\nestimate of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  The Board has previously held that when the record contains a\nbasis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (inconsistent statements, contrary record evidence, etc.),\nthe Judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he or she finds an\napplicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief.  Failure to do so suggests that a Judge has merely\n\nOn his SCA, Applicant stated that he was fired by Employer A due to a disagreement with his supervisor.\n10\nDuring his interview included in GE 7, he characterized the reason for his firing as a \u201cverbal altercation.\u201d  He also stated\nthat, while working for Employer B, he and one of the office managers did not get along.  Tr. at 46.  Compare these\ncomments with the record evidence discussed in footnotes 1 and 2 above. \nGE 7, Response to Interrogatories; GE 15, Termination Letter.\n11\n6\nsubstituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e. g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-23504 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2007). \n  \nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not seriously address the extent to which Applicant\u2019s explanations\nfor his conduct are contradicted by other evidence.  Most significantly, Applicant\u2019s claims that his\nvarious job firings were due to personality clashes are not consistent with record evidence that he\nhad failed to perform satisfactorily and that he had engaged in acts of sexual harassment while on\nthe job.   Additionally, in a subject interview, Applicant initially denied being able to recall why he\n10\nwas terminated by Employer A, despite his having signed a termination letter which explicitly refers\nto his prior counselings and other disciplinary action for his misconduct and for job deficiencies.11\nFinally, the Judge does not address the large number of omissions by Applicant and the fact that\nthese omissions, concerning different matters, occurred over a number of years, which in and of itself\nis a reason to believe that they were deliberate.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect that she\ndevoted serious attention to the contrary record evidence.  This undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nthat the Government had failed to produce substantial evidence (1) that Applicants omissions were\ndeliberate and (2) that Applicant resigned from Employer D in lieu of termination.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nDespite this, the Judge did conclude that the terminations themselves by Employers A, B, and\nC raised Personal Conduct security concerns.  However, she stated that these concerns were\nmitigated by the passage of time and improved conduct and job performance.  The Judge\u2019s decision\non this matter is undercut by her failure to consider record evidence discussed above concerning the\ndeliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omissions on the SCA and the DFEs.  Neither did she discuss record\nevidence that Applicant either denied wrongdoing or minimized his misconduct, described, for\nexample, in Footnotes 1 and 10.  Such evidence undercuts her conclusion that Applicant had\ndemonstrated rehabilitation.  Evidence that Applicant deliberately omitted information on his SCA\nalso undercuts a conclusion that his Guideline E security concerns were not recent.  This failure\nbuttresses Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge substituted a favorable estimation of\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence and that she did not evaluate the evidence in light of the\nrecord as a whole.  The record, viewed in its entirety, does not support a conclusion that Applicant\nhas met his burden of persuasion under the Egan standard.  \nThe errors outlined above are not harmless, in that, had they not been made, the result of the\ncase would likely have been different.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not consider relevant factors and\noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22861, supra, at 2-3.  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision is not\nsustainable, in light of the record as a whole.\n\n7\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 22, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 26, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAugust 31, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on February 2, 2009. DOHA issued an\nAmended SOR on April 20, 2009 and Applicant completed his answer on May 4, 2009.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed in May 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on May 31, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 3, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. The government offered\neighteen exhibits (GE) 1 through 18. Except for GE 13, all exhibits were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted 12 exhibits (AE) A through L, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. The record closed on June 23, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nExclusion of evidence\nDepartment Counsel submitted GE 13, a copy the investigator\u2019s summary of  the\nApplicant\u2019s employment. The Applicant disagreed with information in this document.\nSince the government did not call the investigator to testify and authenticate the\ncontents of the document, I marked GE 13 and included it with the file, but did not admit\nGE 13 into the record. See \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the remaining factual\nallegations in the SOR and the factual allegations of the Amended SOR.  He denied\n1\nintentionally falsifying his answers in his e-QIP. He also provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as a data analyst for a contractor to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. In his current position, he holds a Level 5\nPosition of Trust. He began his work for his employer in January 2006 and his current\nassignment in September 2008. His supervisor states that he consistently meets the\nexpectations of his job and has been successful at assisting customers in resolving data\nissues. Applicant also works as a contract security officer, a position he has held since\nSeptember 2007. His manager describes him as a good officer and an employee who\n\nGE 5 (e-QIP, dated January 5, 2006); AE E (Letter, dated June 11, 2009); AE F (Letter, dated June 22, 2009);\n2\nTr. 35-39.\nGE 1 (SF-86, dated November 11, 1999); GE 2 (SF-86, dated September 9, 2002); GE 11 (Court records);\n3\nTr.  54, 69, 73, 76, 18, 110-111.\nGE 1, supra note 3; GE 6 (Signed Affidavit, dated May 10, 2002); GE 18 (SF 52-B); AE A (National Guard\n4\ndischarge letter); AE B (Army record); Tr. 108.\nGE 6, supra note 4; Tr. 108.\n5\nGE 2, supra, note 3.\n6\n3\ncan be counted upon to perform all aspects of his duties. Applicant constantly meets,\nand more often exceeds, his job expectations.2\nApplicant is single. He has two sons, ages 16 and 11. Neither son lives with him.\nHe maintains regular contact with his older son, but he has lost all contact with his\nyounger son. He does not know where his younger son lives. He pays court ordered\nchild support for his older son.3\nApplicant started college in 1993, with a major in chemical engineering. He joined\nthe United States Army in December 1994. Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication (SF-86) in November 1999. On this application, he listed his older son, but\nnot his younger son. He also denied any outstanding debts. While in the Army,\nApplicant served in Europe. The Army awarded him an Army Achievement Medal, a\nGood Conduct Medal, a National Defense Service Medal, a National Defense Service\nMedal, and other medals, ribbons, and badges for his service. The Army honorably\ndischarged him from active duty on July 13, 2000. He served two more years in the\nArmy Reserve and was honorably discharged in August 2002. While in the Army\nReserve, he worked in a temporary civilian position as a GS-5 supply clerk. The Army\nterminated this position on July 18, 2001 because of lack of funds. He completed about\ntwo years of college, some while in the Army.4\nApplicant met with a security investigator on May 10, 2002. He advised the\ninvestigator that he had a second son born in 1998 and that he had consolidated his\ndebts. He explained that he did not list his second son on his November 1999 SF-86\nbecause he was not yet born.5\nApplicant completed a second SF-86 on September 9, 2002. He listed both his\nsons and acknowledged that two student loans were delinquent. He indicated he had\nretained a financial services company to work with him on repayment of these debts.6\nApplicant began work with a federal contractor, employer A, in August 2002. On\nOctober 30, 2002, employer A counseled Applicant about violations of its Standards of\nConduct for employees. Specially, the employer discussed allegations of harassment,\nincluding sexual harassment, respect in the workplace, inappropriate comments, and\n\nGE 14 (Letter, dated November 14, 2003); Tr. 43-46, 83-85.\n7\nGE 3 (2003 Declaration of Federal Employment form); Tr. 104-106.\n8\nGE 1, supra note 3; GE 14, supra note 7; Tr. 46, 85.\n9\n4\nunprofessional behavior, such as hugging and touching female co-workers. The\nemployer suspended Applicant for three days and required him to attend EEO training,\nwhich he did. Applicant filed a written response to this letter with his employer. In his\nwritten response and oral meeting, Applicant denied the allegations of sexual\nharassment and other conduct. On January 2, 2003, a personal specialist filed a written\nreport, stating that Applicant was flirting with a female government employee and that\nApplicant was reported to be looking for another job. Three weeks later, this employer\nterminated his employment during the initial one-year trial employment based on his\nconduct enumerated in the October 2002 counseling and a failure to maintain office\nconduct standards. He continued to deny any sexual harassment. He believed that he\nwas a permanent employee in this job and that he was fired after an argument with his\nsupervisor.7\nApplicant began work for employer B, a federal agency, in April 2003 as a GS-7\nAdministrative Support Assistant. At this time, he completed a signed Declaration of\nFederal Employment form. Question 12 on this form asks:\nDuring the last 5 years, have you been fired from any job for any reason,\ndid you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job\nby mutual agreement because of specific problems, or were you debarred\nfrom Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any\nother Federal agency? If \u201cYES,\u201d use item 1C to provide the date, an\nexplanation of the problem, reason for leaving and the employer\u2019s name\nand address.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question. He did not list his termination from employer\nA. He explained that he rushed through his answers. He thought it meant federal jobs\nonly.8\nIn November 2003, while Applicant was still a probationary employee, employer\nB terminated him based on unacceptable conduct and performance. Applicant believes\nhe was terminated because he and the office manager clashed. From November 2003\nuntil September 2004, Applicant worked for a federal contractor without incident.9\nIn September 2004, Applicant began work for employer C, another federal\nagency, as a GS-9 program support specialist. He completed a second Declaration for\nFederal Employment on September 7, 2004. He again answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 12,\nthus, failing to list his dismissals by employers A and B. He attributed his failure to\n\nGE 4 (2004 Declaration of Federal Employment form); Tr. 102-106.\n10\nGE 5, supra note 2; GE 7 (Interrogatories and answers with attachments); GE 16 (SF 50-B); Tr. 48.\n11\nGE 7, supra note 11; GE 8 (Affidavit, signed May 8, 2008); GE 17 (Employer D\u2019s business records); Tr. 49-\n12\n53.\n5\nrushing through the document and his belief he did not need to list a termination during\nhis probationary period.  \n10\nEmployer C terminated his employment on June 11, 2005 while he was still a\nprobationary employee. The agency documentation provides no reason for his\ntermination. In an affidavit dated May 30, 2008, Applicant stated that when he was\nterminated, he was told that he was not meeting the work guidelines for his position. He\nacknowledged being in a training program for performance improvement. He stated that\nhe received positive feedback on his improving performance and suggestions on\nadditional areas of improvement. He further stated that his supervisor always found\nproblems with the letters he composed. Applicant thought his work was satisfactory.11\nIn June 2005, Applicant started working for employer D, a federal contractor. In\nlate December 2005, he resigned from his position, effective January 12, 2006, to\naccept a position with his current employer. Employer D entered a Status Change\nNotice in its personnel records on February 6, 2006, indicating Applicant voluntarily\nresigned. On August 27, 2007, a HR Specialist e-mailed a request to Applicant\u2019s former\nsupervisor at employer D and asked if Applicant was rehirable. The same day, his\nsupervisor answered that he was not rehirable because he gave him the option to\nresign for poor performance before being fired. The supervisor then stated \u201cAfter he was\nfired, an ex-girlfriend of his replied to all on e-mail [sic] he had sent from his DOJ\naccount that accused him of some negative things. This man is not to be trusted.\u201d\nApplicant denied the allegation he was fired. He acknowledged issues at work\nconcerning how work should be performed. His employer did not provide training;\nrather, he learned through trial and error. He would receive negative commentary after\nan issue arose, such as when he e-mailed co-workers concerning work issues without\nobtaining approval to send the e-mail. He stated that his ex-girlfriend broke into his\npersonal e-mail account and sent the e-mail to everyone in his address book, including\nco-workers at employer D and his current employer. The employer\u2019s employee\nhandbook is not of record, nor are its policies on handling performance issues in the\nfile.12\nApplicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, required him to complete an e-\nQIP, which Applicant did on January 5, 2006. Applicant listed all seven of his employers\nfrom 2000, including contact information, and his military service. His listed his recent\ncollege attendance, but not his earlier college attendance. He listed his mother and\nsister as his relatives, but not his sons. He acknowledged being known by another\nname. He denied any outstanding debts. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the following questions:\n\nGE 5, supra note 2; Tr. 41-44, 61, 77-80, 101-103, 110.\n13\nGE 11, supra note 3; Tr. 54, 66-69, 73, 76, 110-113.\n14\nGE 7, supra note 11; GE 12 (Credit report); Tr. 63-66. \n15\n6\nSection 22: Your Employment Record \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years?\n1.\nFired from a job.\n2.\nQuit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.\n3. \nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.\n4.\nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory\nperformance.\n5.\nLeft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.\nApplicant listed his job with employer A and gave \u201cdisagreement with supervisor\u201d\nas the reason for being fired from this job. He did not list his terminations with\nemployers B and C. At the hearing, he explained that he did not list these job\nterminations as he was on probation when he was terminated. He believed that since he\ncould be terminated from a probationary position for any reason, whether or not cause\nfor his termination existed, he did not need to list these jobs as being fired or terminated\nfor cause as requested by the question. In his mind, there was a difference between\nbeing fired and terminated in a probationary period. He now understands he was wrong\nin this view. He described his failure to list his sons as \u201ca bone-head mistake\u201d.13\nUnknown to him, in early January 2006, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend and the\nmother of his older son filed an action in the local courts for child support. The process\nserver gave Applicant the court papers as he left home for his new job one morning in\nearly January 2006. He and his former girlfriend reached an agreement on child\nsupport. The court memorized their agreement in an Order dated June 1, 2006. This\nOrder included retroactive child support. Although Applicant had provided monetary and\nnon-monetary support informally, he lacked proof, which resulted in the retroactive\naward. He is current on his child support payments.14\nThe government submitted a credit report dated January 23, 2006, which does\nnot indicate that any debts are overdue. The debt identified in allegation 1.l is listed as\n\u201cpays as agreed.\u201d Applicant met with an investigator in April 2006 and voluntarily\nacknowledged that two debts, including the debt in allegation 1.l, were delinquent since\nlate 2005. In meeting with this investigator, he also volunteered other information not\nlisted on his e-QIP. He again volunteered information about this debt when meeting with\nthe investigator in October 2006.15\nApplicant stated that he had difficulty adjusting to working in the civilian world\nafter he left the Army. He advised that he continues to learn from his mistakes and has\n\nAE C (resume); GE 7, supra note 11; Tr. 124-126.\n16\nGE 7, supra note 11; AE D through AE L (letters of recommendation).\n17\nApplicant listed November 9, 1992, November 8, 1994, and November 6, 1991 as the birth date of his older\n18\nson. The actual birth date is November 6, 1992. See GE 1; GE 2; GE 7; GE11. He listed two different birth\nyears for his second son. GE 2; GE 6; GE 7. Moreover, his employment dates are not exact.\n7\nimproved his working relationships and himself. He recently completed his college\neducation, receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems and a\nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration.16\nSupervisors, co-workers, and friends provided recommendations on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf. They described him as a good employee who meets his job expectations. His\n2007 performance evaluation showed him as a solid performer. He is described as\ntrustworthy and responsible. A performance evaluation from his reserve supervisor\nsome years ago indicated he excelled at many of his performance elements. The\nsupervisor praised many of his skills. This review also noted that he needed to learn\nbetter self control and tact and to control his temper.17\nApplicant demonstrated at the hearing that he is poor with dates and time lines.18\nHe understood the events and what occurred as he remembered. He did not organize\nhis thoughts and presentation well. A review of the documents in this case reflects that\nApplicant provided the necessary information to evaluate his security worthiness over a\nperiod of time, but not all at the same point in time.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n8\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n\n9\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group.\nThree employers between January 2003 and June 2005 terminated Applicant\nfrom his position for a variety of reasons, including allegations of sexual harassment,\ninappropriate conduct, and poor performance. Concerning the cessation of his\nemployment with employer D in January 2006, employer D\u2019s personnel records\nindicated that Applicant voluntarily resigned. As this is a business record, this document\nis credible. This business record supported Applicant\u2019s adamant position that he\nvoluntarily left his job with employer D to accept his current employment, which started\nin January 2006. The e-mail dated August 27, 2007 is entitled to little weight, and is thus\nof very limited credibility because it was issued 19 months after Applicant\u2019s resignation\nand is primarily based on a derogatory and unsubstantiated hearsay e-mail from\nApplicant\u2019s former girlfriend. The August 27, 2007 e-mail makes only a passing\nreference to work performance issues. The government has established its prima facie\ncase for allegations 1.a through 1.d under AG \u00b6 16(e), but has not met its burden of\nproof for allegation 1.e. Given my findings concerning the August 2007 e-mail, the\ngovernment has not met its burden of proof as to allegation 1.h. \nFor AG DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in\nhis answer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted\nmaterial facts from his Declaration for Federal Employment when he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nthe questions about negative job terminations and failed to list his November 2003 and\nhis June 2005 job terminations during his probationary period. This information is\nmaterial to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and\nto his honesty. In his response to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant denied,\nhowever, that he had an intent to hide this information from the government. When a\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n19\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving the\nomission was deliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.19\nApplicant failed to list his employment termination in January 2003 on the\nDeclaration of Federal Employment he executed three months later on April 7, 2003. He\nknew at this time that he had been fired from this job. When he completed the\nDeclaration of Federal Employment form on September 7, 2004, he not only failed to list\nthe January 2003 termination, but he also failed to list his November 2003 employment\ntermination. At the time he completed this application, he knew that he had left these\njobs for unfavorable reasons. Applicant provided a credible explanation at the hearing\nfor why he answered this question in the negative in 2003 and 2004. The government\nhas not established its prima facie case as to allegations 1.f and 1.g.\nConcerning his failure to list his sons on his 2006 e-QIP, his most recent security\nclearance application, Applicant did not intentionally falsify this information. The\ngovernment knew from his earlier SF-86 applications that he had one son and from his\n2002 statement that he had a second son. This lack of information is not material to an\nassessment of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness because, contrary to the government\u2019s\nassertion, Applicant\u2019s failure to list his sons was not to try to avoid paying child support\npayments or to avoid embarrassment. He does not pay child support for his younger\nson and child support has not been requested. He does not know where his younger\nson is currently living. On the other hand, he has contacts with his older son and\nprovided support for this son on an informal basis. He now complies with the court\nordered child support payments. The government has not met its burden of proof as to\nallegations 1.i and 1.j. \nApplicant listed all of his jobs between 1995 and January 2006, including contact\ninformation for each employer. He included the three jobs from which he was terminated\nor fired. He made no effort to hide the jobs which ended negatively for him. Rather, he\nmade information available to the government which gave the government the ability to\nverify his employment, work history, and performance. He acknowledged that he was\nfired from employer A, but erroneously believed that he did not need to list jobs from\nwhich he was terminated during a probationary period on his January 2006 e-QIP. His\nerroneous belief is not evidence of intentional falsification. The government has not\nestablished its burden of proof as to allegation 1.k.\nApplicant did not falsify his answers concerning overdue debts. The January\n2006 credit report indicates that the debt of concern to the government was in a \u201cpays\nas agreed\u201d status. Applicant acknowledged that he became delinquent in his payments\n\n11\non this debt in late 2005, which would be November or December 2005, less than 90\ndays before he completed his e-QIP. He voluntarily provided information on this debt, as\nshown by the investigator\u2019s reports. The government has not established any debts\ndelinquent at least 90 days at the time he completed his January 5, 2006 e-QIP, and\naccordingly, allegation 1.l. is not established.\nApplicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. The\nfollowing conditions are relevant to this case:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nSubsequent to his honorable discharge from the Army, Applicant began working\nin private industry and as a civilian employee for the federal government. He worked\nwell at four jobs, but did not work well at three jobs. He acknowledged that he had\nproblems at these three jobs. His transition from military to civilian work proved to be a\nrough road for him. He, however, tried to learn from each negative situation and to\nimprove his work skills. His efforts have been rewarded, as he has worked for his\ncurrent employer for more than three and one-half years. His supervisor rated him solid\nin 2007 and his current supervisor has no complaints about his performance or conduct.\nThroughout the last three and one-half years, Applicant demonstrated that he is a good\nand desirable employee. He found a work environment which works for him and his\nemployer. He improved his conduct and performance. His last job termination occurred\nmore than four years ago. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns\nabout his past negative employment history under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d). Allegations\n1.a through 1.d are found in favor of Applicant. \n\n12\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nserved on active duty in the Army for five years without problems. The Army awarded\nhim medals, including a good conduct medal, ribbons and badges for his work. He\nreceived an honorable discharge from active duty and from the Army National Guard.\nAlthough his Army Reserve supervisor did recommend that he learn better self control\nand more control over his temper, he praised Applicant\u2019s work and rated his\nperformance and conduct as best qualified. When he returned to the civilian work force,\nApplicant encountered difficulties in some work environments, but not all. Between his\nAugust 2002 discharge from the Army Reserve and January 2006, Applicant worked at\nseven jobs, four successfully and three unsuccessfully. A job termination or job firing\nusually occurs because of multiple factors, not one simple factor. An obvious factor,\nsuch as job performance, is usually not the only reason problems arise in the complexity\nof a workplace. Workplace environment, management philosophy, employee\nperceptions, and the personalities of all company employees play an important role in\nthe success of an individual in a workplace. Applicant did not work well in three jobs for\na variety of reasons. He, however, worked well in the Army, four other jobs, and most\n\nBeing terminated from a job does not necessarily mean being fired. I take administrative notice of the\n20\nfollowing word definitions from Merriam-W ebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, 11  Ed. (2003):\nth\n1)\nFire vb fired; firing vt 1a : . . .  2 a: to drive out or away by or as if by fire b: to dismiss from\na position . . .\n2)\nTerminate vb 1: . . . 2: to form an ending 3: to come to an end in time vt 1 a: to bring to an\nend: CLOSE b: to form the conclusion of <review questions . . .> c: to discontinue the\nemployment of <workers terminated because of slow business> 2: to serve as an ending,\nlimit, or boundary of . . .\nIn the business world, many jobs are ended or concluded for a variety of reasons, such as work loss, lack of\nfunds, loss of customers, that are not negative to an employee. The ending or conclusion of these jobs is often\ncategorized as \u201cterminated.\u201d W hen a person is discharged or dismissed from a job for specific job-related\nissues, the employee\u2019s departure is categorized as \u201cfired\u201d.\n13\nimportantly, for the last three and one-half years in his current job. He learned from his\nmistakes and improved his workplace skills.\nThe government argues that his failure to properly answer the questions on his\nsecurity clearance application over a period of time shows a pattern of lying. Despite\nseveral allegations of falsification, the government\u2019s evidence failed to establish this\npattern. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose two children on his e-QIP is credibly described as\n\u201ca bone-head mistake\u201d and the result of carelessness. He credibly contends that he\nvoluntarily resigned from employer D and the credible evidence of record supports his\nposition. He voluntarily provided information on his finances on two separate occasions\nand other positive or negative information left out of his e-QIP. His belief that since he\nworked as a probationary employee, he did not need to list the termination of his\nprobationary jobs is mistaken. Employer B clearly terminated him for performance\nissues and he acknowledged he had performance issues in the eyes of his\nmanagement at employer C. Because the e-QIP seeks negative employment\ninformation, Applicant should have listed the two federal government jobs which\nterminated, not fired, him in lieu of offering him a permanent position.20\nApplicant is a responsible adult as shown by his support of his older son both\nfinancially and actually. He works at two jobs to assure enough income to pay his bills.\nHe learns from his mistakes and works to improve himself. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal  conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n14\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On January 16, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 14 includes a memorandum by a Senior Vice President of Employer A suspending\n1\nApplicant without pay for three days for \u201csexual and other harassment as result of several complaints of inappropriate\nand unprofessional behavior.  These complaints included allegations of inappropriate relationships, as well as\ninappropriate touching and hugging of female coworkers in the job site.\u201d  Applicant was informed that subsequent\ninfractions could result in job termination.  This exhibit also includes another memorandum by the same person,\ndescribing in detail his counseling session with Applicant.  This memo describes objectively offensive behavior,\nincluding unwanted touching of female workers, sexually suggestive comments, etc.  According to this document,\nApplicant denied being able to recall the incidents alleged against him, nor could he explain why others would make\nthese kinds of accusations against him.  \u201c[Applicant] said he was sorry, but there were no obvious attempts to admit any\nwrong doing[.]\u201d\nGE 15 is a memorandum from the Assistant Deputy Administrator of Employee B, advising Applicant that he\n2\nwas being terminated prior to the conclusion of his probationary period.  This document states that the reason for the\ntermination was \u201cunacceptable conduct and performance,\u201d including \u201crude and abrupt behavior with coworkers,\u201d\n\u201ccontinued demonstration of disrespect for coworkers,\u201d and unacceptable job performance.  It also stated that Applicant\nhad been provided feedback on his poor conduct, without improvement.  GE 15 contains a receipt acknowledgment\nsigned by Applicant.  In a Personal Subject Interview summary included in GE 7, Response to Interrogatories, Applicant\nacknowledged having been counseled while working for Employer B because a customer had complained about him.\n\u201cHe stated that the only problems he had at [Employer B] were people demanding things of him that he could not obtain\nfor them, problems with organizing travel and all of the various factors involved in that, and other customer service\nrelated problems.\u201d     \n2\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Government had not met its burden of production and whether the Judge\u2019s\napplication of the mitigating factors was erroneous.  Finding error, we reverse.  \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a data analyst for a federal\ncontractor.  He has two sons, ages 16 and 11.  He served in the Army from 1994 until 1999.  \nApplicant began to work for Employer A, a federal contractor, in 2002.  During the course\nof the employment, Employer A counseled Applicant for violating its standards of conduct by\nengaging in sexual harassment, inappropriate touching, inappropriate comments, etc.  Employer A\nsubsequently terminated Applicant based on this conduct.1\nApplicant then went to work for Employer B, a federal agency.  He completed a Declaration\nfor Federal Employment (DFE), which inquired, inter alia, whether, within the previous five years,\nhe had ever been fired from a job for any reason.

He\ncompleted a second DFE in which he again answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about whether he had ever\nbeen fired from a job.  Applicant stated that he had rushed through the form and believed that he did\n\nBoth DFEs contain identical language: \u201cDuring the last 5 years, have you been fired from any job for any\n3\nreason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of\nspecific problems, or were you debarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other\nFederal Agency?\u201d  GE 3, 4.  \nSee GE 7, Response to Interrogatories: \u201c[Applicant] admitted that he was terminated from his position at\n4\n[Employer C] due to unsuccessful completion of the probationary period . . . It was just a bad fit.\u201d    \n3\nnot have to list terminations that occurred during a probationary period.   Approximately one year\n3\nlater, Employer C terminated Applicant.  Applicant was advised that \u201che was not meeting the work\nguidelines for his position.\u201d   Id.\n4\nApplicant subsequently began working for Employer D.  He resigned from this employment\nto take a position with his current employer.  \nIn January 2006, Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA).  In answering\nthe question inquiring if he had been fired from a job within the prior seven years, the Judge found\nthat Applicant listed his termination by Employer A, but not B or C.  In response to other questions\non the SCA, he did not list his two sons, and he denied any outstanding debts.  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\n\nIn her discussion of Applicant\u2019s resignation from Employer D, the Judge noted GE 17, Status Change Notice,\n5\nwhich refers to difficulties Applicant was having with his job.  Included in this document is an email from an Operations\nDirector at D:  \u201cI kindly gave him the option to resign before I fired him for poor performance.  After he was fired, an\nex-girlfriend of his replied to all on an email he had sent from his [official] account that accused him of some negative\nthings.  The man is not to be trusted.\u201d  The Judge stated that, because this email was sent out after the fact, and was based\non hearsay from Applicant\u2019s girlfriend, it was entitled to little weight.  Accordingly, she concluded that the Government\nhad not met its burden of production as to Applicant\u2019s resignation from Employer D.  However, GE 7, Response to\nInterrogatories, includes a summary of an interview in which Applicant addressed this resignation.  \u201cRegarding his\nemployment with [Employer D] [Applicant] was confronted with the unfavorable information [obtained during the\ninvestigation]. . .  He explained that he never knew there was a problem or that his behavior was considered disrespectful\n(particularly in regards to his contact with female coworkers) until he was spoken to approximately two months after he\nbegan working there . . . that his behavior was bordering on sexual harassment . . . Regarding the unapproved email he\nsent out, he thought that it was acceptable to send out the email without having his worked checked . . .\u201d  This interview\ncorroborates the email contained in GE 17 and provides a strong reason to believe that, at the time he resigned from\nEmployer D, Applicant was aware of deficiencies in his conduct and performance.  The interview undercuts the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that the Government had not met its burden of production that Applicant resigned from Employer D under\nunfavorable circumstances and that he had not intended to deceive when he omitted that incident from his SCA.\n4\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006). \nThe Judge concluded that the Government had not met its burden of production as to the\nalleged deliberate nature of the omissions.  She also concluded that the Government had not met its\nburden regarding an allegation that Applicant resigned from Employer D in lieu of termination for\npoor performance.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions do not take into account\nsignificant contrary record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  \nWhen an applicant denies an allegation contained in a SOR, the Government must produce\nsubstantial evidence of the truth of the allegation.  Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  In the case of an omission in a SCA\nor some other document, the Government\u2019s burden of production requires more than merely showing\nthat the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  Rather,\nthe Government must present substantial evidence that the omission was deliberate.  In evaluating\nwhether the Government has met its burden of production concerning an omission, the Judge must\nexamine the omission in light of the record as a whole.  See ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSep. 26, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect that she took into account record evidence\nthat is not consistent with the view that Applicant\u2019s omissions on the SCA and the two DFEs were\ninnocent.  For example, the record contains evidence that, as regards Applicant\u2019s dismissals from\nEmployers A, B, and C, and his resignation from D,  the circumstances underlying these actions\n5\ninclude poor job performance, failure to obey standards of conduct, etc.  Indeed, the record\n\nSee e.g., Tr. at 54-55.\n6\nTr. at 101-102.\n7\nSee Tr. at 80.  See also Department Counsel Brief at 12: \u201c[A]t the hearing Applicant also claimed, for the first\n8\ntime, that when he read the [DFEs] he misunderstood Question 12 as requiring disclosure of only Federal jobs.\u201d  \nSee Subject Personal Interview summary included in GE 7: \u201cHe did not realize that he needed to list his\n9\nchildren (both of whom were born out of wedlock) on the case papers.\u201d  The implication is that Applicant believed he\ndid not need to list his two children, due to their illegitimacy, which suggests that he gave the question some degree of\nreflection.  This is not totally consistent with his testimony that it was an inexplicable mistake.  \n5\ndemonstrates that Applicant was previously disciplined by Employer A for the same conduct which\nresulted in his termination.  This record evidence supports a conclusion that the circumstances\nunderlying the dismissals from Employers A, B, and C and the resignation from Employer D were\nnot favorable to Applicant.  A reasonable person could conclude that they supply Applicant with a\nmotive to prevent their discovery and, therefore, a motive for deliberately omitting them from the\nGovernment documents in question.  That the Judge did not address this evidence undermines her\nconclusion that the Government had not met its burden of production.\nAdditionally, the record contains some apparently inconsistent statements by Applicant,\nwhich undermine the credibility of his claims that his omissions were not deliberate.  For example,\nhe variously attributed his omissions of the job firings to his having rushed through the documents,6\nto his belief that he did not have to list terminations that occurred during probationary periods,  and,\n7\nregarding the DFEs, to his mistaken opinion that he only needed to address firings from federal jobs.8\nConcerning his having omitted his sons from the SCA, during the hearing Applicant stated that this\nwas a \u201cbone-headed\u201d mistake which shouldn\u2019t have happened.  However, during a prior interview,\nApplicant advised the investigator that he did not realize that he needed to list his children, which\nreasonably implied that he had made a considered decision not to do so.   The Judge\u2019s decision does\n9\n not sufficiently address Applicant\u2019s inconsistencies, either by attempting to resolve or explain them,\nor by attempting to demonstrate that they are relatively insignificant.  This undermines her favorable\nestimate of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  The Board has previously held that when the record contains a\nbasis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (inconsistent statements, contrary record evidence, etc.),\nthe Judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he or she finds an\napplicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief.  Failure to do so suggests that a Judge has merely\nsubstituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e. g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-23504 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2007). \n  \nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not seriously address the extent to which Applicant\u2019s explanations\nfor his conduct are contradicted by other evidence.  Most significantly, Applicant\u2019s claims that his\nvarious job firings were due to personality clashes are not consistent with record evidence that he\nhad failed to perform satisfactorily and that he had engaged in acts of sexual harassment while on\n\nOn his SCA, Applicant stated that he was fired by Employer A due to a disagreement with his supervisor.\n10\nDuring his interview included in GE 7, he characterized the reason for his firing as a \u201cverbal altercation.\u201d  He also stated\nthat, while working for Employer B, he and one of the office managers did not get along.  Tr. at 46.  Compare these\ncomments with the record evidence discussed in footnotes 1 and 2 above. \nGE 7, Response to Interrogatories; GE 15, Termination Letter.\n11\n6\nthe job.   Additionally, in a subject interview, Applicant initially denied being able to recall why he\n10\nwas terminated by Employer A, despite his having signed a termination letter which explicitly refers\nto his prior counselings and other disciplinary action for his misconduct and for job deficiencies.11\nFinally, the Judge does not address the large number of omissions by Applicant and the fact that\nthese omissions, concerning different matters, occurred over a number of years, which in and of itself\nis a reason to believe that they were deliberate.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect that she\ndevoted serious attention to the contrary record evidence.  This undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nthat the Government had failed to produce substantial evidence (1) that Applicants omissions were\ndeliberate and (2) that Applicant resigned from Employer D in lieu of termination.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nDespite this, the Judge did conclude that the terminations themselves by Employers A, B, and\nC raised Personal Conduct security concerns.  However, she stated that these concerns were\nmitigated by the passage of time and improved conduct and job performance.  The Judge\u2019s decision\non this matter is undercut by her failure to consider record evidence discussed above concerning the\ndeliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omissions on the SCA and the DFEs.  Neither did she discuss record\nevidence that Applicant either denied wrongdoing or minimized his misconduct, described, for\nexample, in Footnotes 1 and 10.  Such evidence undercuts her conclusion that Applicant had\ndemonstrated rehabilitation.  Evidence that Applicant deliberately omitted information on his SCA\nalso undercuts a conclusion that his Guideline E security concerns were not recent.  This failure\nbuttresses Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge substituted a favorable estimation of\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence and that she did not evaluate the evidence in light of the\nrecord as a whole.  The record, viewed in its entirety, does not support a conclusion that Applicant\nhas met his burden of persuasion under the Egan standard.  \nThe errors outlined above are not harmless, in that, had they not been made, the result of the\ncase would likely have been different.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not consider relevant factors and\noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22861, supra, at 2-3.  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision is not\nsustainable, in light of the record as a whole.\n\n7\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant began to work for Employer A, a federal contractor, in 2002. During the course of the employment, Employer A counseled Applicant for violating its standards of conduct by engaging in sexual harassment, inappropriate touching, inappropriate comments, etc. Employer A subsequently terminated Applicant based on this conduct.1 Applicant then went to work for Employer B, a federal agency. He completed a Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE), which inquired, inter alia, whether, within the previous five years, he had ever been fired from a job for any reason. He answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant \u201crushed through his answers. He thought it meant federal jobs only.\u201d Decision at 4. Employer B terminated Applicant \u201cbased on unacceptable conduct and performance.\u201d Id. 2 In September 2004 Applicant began working for Employer C, also a federal agency. He completed a second DFE in which he again answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about whether he had ever been fired from a job. Applicant stated that he had rushed through the form and believed that he did Both DFEs contain identical language: \u201cDuring the last 5 years, have you been fired from any job for any 3 reason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, or were you debarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal Agency?\u201d GE 3, 4.

It was just a bad fit.\u201d 3 not have to list terminations that occurred during a probationary period. Approximately one year 3 later, Employer C terminated Applicant. Applicant was advised that \u201che was not meeting the work guidelines for his position.\u201d Id. 4 Applicant subsequently began working for Employer D. He resigned from this employment to take a position with his current employer. In January 2006, Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA). In answering the question inquiring if he had been fired from a job within the prior seven years, the Judge found that Applicant listed his termination by Employer A, but not B or C. In response to other questions on the SCA, he did not list his two sons, and he denied any outstanding debts.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 12 March 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant answered the SOR 27 March 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 16 April 2008, and I convened a hearing 12 May 2008. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 20 May 2008.\n \nMay 30, 2008\n\nAt hearing, Department Counsel indicated that based on the evidence the government did not intend to\n2\ngo forward with the allegation at SOR 1.n. Accordingly, I consider that allegation withdrawn.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.a., 1.b., and 1.g. He is a\n26-year-old senior technician employed by a defense contractor since November 2004.\nHe has not previously held a clearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits confirm, 13 delinquent debts totaling\nover $7,000.  Applicant was questioned about these debts during an interview with a\n2\ngovernment investigator in March 2007. The contents of that interview are unknown\nbecause Applicant either does not remember what he said to the investigator, or flatly\ndenies any admissions attributed to him. After the interview, Applicant claims to have\nbeen in contact with some of the creditors, but he is unable to corroborate that he did so\nor that he resolved any of the debts. Following receipt of the SOR, Applicant hired a law\nfirm specializing in credit issues, and is disputing all 13 debts (A.E. A, B). However, he\nhas not yet received any answers to the law firm\u2019s inquiries of his creditors\nIn January 2007, Applicant was served with paternity papers seeking back child\nsupport for a child alleged to be his. Applicant asserted that this was the first he knew\nhe was alleged to have fathered a child. He disputed paternity, but was ultimately found\nto have fathered the child. His 2008 state and federal tax refunds, in an amount\napproximating the debt alleged at SOR 1.f., were seized in February 2008 and applied\nto his account (A.E. C). However, his most recent earnings statement reflects that he is\nmaking bi-weekly payments for child support and arrears (A.E. F).\nAlthough Applicant denies having financial difficulties\u2014and thus offers no\nreasons that he might have such difficulties\u2014he describes personal circumstances that\nmight explain the confusing state of his credit reports: divorce from his first wife, multiple\nmoves while in the military, maintaining a residence in the U.S. while he was deployed\noverseas. Nevertheless, the circumstances described do not match the level of disarray\ndisplayed by his credit reports.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n4\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n5\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n6\n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n3\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s credit reports establish his\nindebtedness. Applicant was aware of the alleged debts since at least March 2007, yet\nhe took no effective action to address the debts before the SOR was issued.  The only\n4\naction taken by Applicant after the SOR was issued was to hire a law firm to dispute the\ndebts. That effort may bear fruit, but not in time to be much help to Applicant in this\ncase.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  There is no evidence the debts were\n5\ndue to circumstances beyond his control and he has not acted responsibly in\naddressing his debts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or\n6\n\n7\n\u00b620.\u00a9 the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\notherwise brought the problem under control.  None of the alleged debts have been\n7\npaid, much less in a timely, good-faith effort.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or\n8\nuse financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put\nhis financial problems behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n2\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April 23, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on unpaid federal and\nstate tax liens, Guideline J for criminal conduct based on failure to file federal income\ntax returns, and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a security-\nclearance application. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n3\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n Exhibits 2 and 6 were not admitted into evidence; therefore, those documents were not considered in making\n4\nfindings of fact or for any other aspect of the case. \n2\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n3\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 2, 2008, and\nshe requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on August 14, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nAugust 25, 2008.\nThe record was left open until August 28, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit documentary information related to the IRS and federal income tax practice\nand procedure. Applicant made a timely submission, and those matters were forwarded\nby department counsel who raised no objections. Collectively, the post-hearing matters\nare admitted as Exhibit E.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.4\nApplicant is a 62-year-old truck driver. She and her spouse operate a trucking\ncompany, and they each hold a commercial driver\u2019s license. They operate as\nindependent contractors for a transit company that contracts with the federal\ngovernment. She is seeking an industrial security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that are related to state and federal\nincome taxes as follows:\n\u2022\nShe is indebted to the IRS for approximately $7,013 for tax year 2001 (Exhibits 4,\n8, and D). The IRS filed on a federal tax lien against Applicant for that amount in\nApril 2006.\n\u2022\nShe is indebted to a state tax authority for approximately $4,636 (Exhibits 5, 7,\nand 8). The state filed three liens against Applicant for different amounts in 2003\nand 2004.\n\n Schiff has been described as \u201ca well-known recidivist tax protestor.\u201d United States v. Schiff, 510 F.3d 1114,\n5\n1116 (9  Cir. 2007). Schiff was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government and multiple tax-related\nth\noffenses, and the Ninth Circuit recently affirmed his convictions and his resulting 151-month sentence. Id. at\n1117, footnote 2. \n In 2004, the Ninth Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction on the sale of a book by Schiff, The Federal Mafia:\n6\nHow the Government Illegally Imposes and Unlawfully Collects Income Taxes, finding it constituted fraudulent\ncommercial speech. United States v. Schiff, 379 F.3d 621, 630 (9  Cir. 2004).\nth\n3\nBeginning in about tax year 2002, Applicant, along with her spouse, stopped filing\nfederal income tax returns. She did so because she was persuaded or convinced by her\nspouse that no law requires a person to file income tax returns and no law requires a\nperson to pay income taxes. As a result, neither she nor her spouse has filed federal\nincome tax returns since tax year 2002. Applicant\u2019s spouse reached these conclusions\nafter studying materials produced by Irwin Schiff,  including his book The Federal Mafia\n5\n6\n(Tr. 71). \nApplicant and her spouse say they have submitted various material to the IRS,\nbut they have yet to receive a response other than an acknowledgment (Exhibit A). One\nof the items they submitted to the IRS is a multiple-page document styled \u201cAffidavit of\nRevocation and Rescission\u201d (Exhibit C). The affidavit contains 25 paragraphs, but in\nessence they claim that the federal government (Congress and the IRS) committed\nconstructive fraud by misleading and deceiving them and the general public into\nbelieving that they were required to file income tax returns and pay income taxes; as a\nresult, they revoked, rescinded, and cancelled all tax documents signed and/or\nsubmitted by them; and they declared that they are not and never were taxpayers and\nare not subject to the federal income tax laws. \nApplicant has not paid, settled, or resolved the tax liens alleged in the SOR (Tr.\n58). Based on the affidavit submitted to the IRS, Applicant has no intention of filing a\nfederal income tax return and she has no intention of paying federal income taxes (Tr.\n62\u201363). And based on income Applicant reported in a personal financial statement, it\nappears Applicant and her spouse have sufficient income ($6,000 monthly) to establish\na tax liability and an obligation to file a return (Exhibit 3).  \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in June 2005 (Exhibit 1). In\ndoing so, she was required to answer several questions about her financial record.\nQuestion 27c inquired about tax liens, and Applicant answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby indicating\nthat she had not had a tax lien placed against her for failing to pay taxes or other debts\nin the last seven years. She did not disclose the three state tax liens filed in 2003 and\n2004 because she was unaware of those liens when she completed the application (Tr.\n59). She first became aware of the state tax liens during the background investigation\n(Tr. 65\u201366). \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.7\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n8\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n9\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n10\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n19\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n20\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n21\n DC 7 is \u201cfailure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing\n22\nof the same.\u201d\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n17\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n18\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n19\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nunresolved financial problems. Both the IRS and a state tax authority have filed tax liens\nagainst Applicant for a total of more than $11,000, and she has no current plan to\naddress these debts. These circumstances raise a security concern because they\nindicate unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n20\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. In addition, the failure to file federal\n21\nincome tax returns raises a security concern as well.  The record evidence is more\n22\nthan sufficient to establish these three disqualifying conditions.  \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n23\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n24\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n25\n6\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. In contrary, her indebtedness was due to circumstances within her\ncontrol and resulted from her criminal conduct, which is discussed below. Applicant\ndoes not have a reasonable basis to dispute the debts, and she has not made a good-\nfaith effort to resolve the indebtedness. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant.   \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n23\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n24\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has engaged in a\npattern of criminal conduct by her deliberate and willful failure to file federal income tax\nreturns since tax year 2002. These circumstances raise a security concern under DC 125\n\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n26\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n W ithout objections, administrative or official notice was taken of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 as set forth in Appellate\n27\nExhibit I (Tr. 34\u201337). Section 7203 is a penalty provision that does not establish a duty to file federal income\ntax returns or to pay federal income taxes.  \n ISCR Case No. 94-1153 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 1997) (also, the Board notes and summarizes numerous federal\n28\ncourt decisions that have rejected challenges to the federal tax laws and IRS regulations and practices).\nLikewise, see ISCR Case 98-0810 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000) (the Board notes and summarizes numerous\nfederal court decisions that have rejected challenges to the federal tax laws and IRS regulations and\npractices). \n7\nand DC 3  because her conduct falls within 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, which makes the willful\n26\nfailure to file a federal income tax return a misdemeanor offense.  Although she has not\n27\nbeen charged in federal court, Applicant\u2019s multiple violations of her obligation to file a\nfederal income tax return cast significant doubt on her fitness for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, along with her spouse, assert that no law requires her to file a federal\nincome tax return and that no law requires her to pay federal income taxes. The DOHA\nAppeal Board has made it clear, however, that a security clearance case is not an\nappropriate forum for contesting the legality of federal income tax laws:\nIf Applicant wishes to challenge the constitutionality and legality of federal\ntax laws (and IRS regulations and practices), then he must seek redress\nelsewhere. Under the Directive, DOHA Administrative Judges and the\nBoard are authorized to adjudicate industrial security clearance cases, not\nthe constitutionality and legality of federal tax laws and IRS regulations\nand practices. In recognition of the limits of the jurisdiction of DOHA\nAdministrative Judges and this Board under the Directive, the rulings of\nfederal courts on the legality and constitutionality of the federal tax laws\nand IRS practices and procedures must be accepted and applied in DOHA\nproceedings.28\nI am aware of no decision from a federal court that supports Applicant\u2019s position that\nshe is not required to file a federal income tax return and that she is not required to pay\nfederal income taxes. Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, which purports to be a copy of several\npages of transcript from a federal court case, does not constitute binding legal\nprecedent and I have given it no weight. Likewise, none of Applicant\u2019s other\ndocumentary exhibits support her position. Accordingly, the record evidence is sufficient\nto show that Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income tax returns since tax year 2002\nwas in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203.  \nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns, but none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Her conduct, and that of her spouse,\nsuggests tax evasion. Her criminal conduct was recent and not isolated. Although she\nwas persuaded or convinced to follow her spouse on this journey, there is no evidence\nshowing she was pressured or coerced into doing so. Further, her criminal conduct is\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n29\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n30\n The government did not produce evidence that Applicant completed a security-clearance application in\n31\nMarch 2006. On this basis, the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.b is decided for Applicant. Likewise, the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c is adequately covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a. On this basis, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c is\ndecided for Applicant.  \n8\nongoing and likely to continue. These circumstances militate against a successful case\nin reform and rehabilitation. Overall, Applicant\u2019s conduct\u2014as well as the dubious and\nspecious legal arguments in her defense\u2014demonstrates poor judgment. Also, it shows\nApplicant lacks the trustworthiness and reliability required of those entrusted with the\nprivilege of a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n29\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n30\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Questions 27c of  her\nJune 2005 security-clearance application, as she did not report the three state tax liens\ncalled for by the question. She denies that her answer was intentionally false and\ncontends she was unaware of the liens when she completed the application. Having had\nthe opportunity to listen to her testimony and observe her demeanor, her explanation is\naccepted as credible. The evidence is not sufficient to show that she made a\ndeliberately false statement when she answered Question 27c. On this basis, Guideline\nE is decided for Applicant.  \n31\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raises under Guidelines F and J. Applicant\ndid not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and\nthat analysis does not support a favorable decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.a\u20133.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest  to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 7, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s written case on June 30, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nOctober 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 16, 2008. She responded with an undated letter \nand four documents. Department Counsel did not object to her response. I have marked \nApplicant\u2019s response as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, and they are admitted. \nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on September 9, 2008, and \nreassigned to me on September 11, 2008. I requested Department Counsel to set up a \nconference call with Applicant. I had a conference call with Department Counsel and \nApplicant on September 18, 2008. I told Applicant that I would hold the record open until \nSeptember 24, 2008, for her to submit additional information. She was directed to fax a \ncopy of any matter to both Department Counsel and me. Department Counsel had until \nOctober 1, 2008, to respond to Applicant\u2019s submission. Applicant submitted two \ndocuments which I have marked AE F and G, and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since March 2007. She attended community college. She was \nmarried but has been divorced for more than ten years. She has four children, ages 22, \n21, 18, and 17.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 21-year-old son is serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. He deployed to \nIraq in August 2007, and served there until his return in the spring of 2008. Her two \nyoungest children were living with their father in another state. Her 18-year-old daughter \nmoved to live with Applicant last year when she was 17 years old and pregnant. She \ngave birth to a premature baby, which led to many medical bills above what was \ncovered by insurance. Her 17-year-old son also came to live with her last year. Her son \nand daughter brought almost no clothes with them and Applicant had to buy them \nclothes. Her oldest son moved from the state where his siblings used to live in about \nApril 2008, and at least initially lived with Applicant until he could find his own place. It is \nunclear if he moved out of Applicant\u2019s house as was the plan.2 \n \n \nApplicant lived in the state that her children lived until September 2005. She was \nin an abusive relationship with a man in that state from 2004 through September 2005. \nShe was the victim of domestic violence. She received a Personal Protection Order \n(PPO) against him by the state court. Her car was vandalized on several occasions \nwhile the PPO was in effect. She strongly suspected he was responsible for the damage \nto her car but she had no proof. She missed work because of car problems. She \neventually dropped the PPO and moved back in with him until she could relocate to her \ncurrent state in September 2005, and get away from him. She was unemployed for \nabout three months when she arrived at her current location.3 \n                                                          \n1 Items 3, 4. \n \n2 Items 2-4. \n \n3 Items 3, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts, totaling $7,640. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b total \n$5,874. The remaining 15 debts total $1,766. She admitted to owing all the debts with \nthe exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.p, which she denied.  \n \n \nApplicant and her domestic partner in the other state rented an apartment \ntogether. When she moved to the state where she now lives, she assumed that he \nwould maintain the payments until the end of the lease. He did not. SOR \u00b61.a reflects a \njudgment awarded to the apartment landlord in February 2006, for $2,033. SOR \u00b61.b \nreflects a delinquent debt of $3,841 owed to a collection company, collecting on behalf \nof the same apartment landlord. Applicant first became aware of the debt to the landlord \nwhen she obtained her credit report in May 2007, in anticipation of submitting her \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions. Applicant paid the debt to the landlord, \nwhich had risen to $3,942, on April 29, 2008. Applicant submitted a credit report dated \nApril 18, 2008, with her response to the SOR. She handwrote on the credit report that \nthis debt was paid on April 29, 2008. Her handwritten comment was corroborated by a \ncredit report dated September 8, 2008, which reported that the debt had a zero balance \nand was paid in May 2008. Applicant handwrote on both credit reports that the judgment \nto the same landlord was paid. Neither credit report lists the judgment as paid. Applicant \nindicated that the judgment was paid and that it would be reflected on a new credit \nreport not yet obtained after the court documents reported that the judgment was \nsatisfied.4 I find that Applicant paid the underlying debt that the judgment was based \nupon and that SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.b have been resolved.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a medical debt of $20. Applicant handwrote on the credit \nreport of April 18, 2008, that the debt was paid, but that she did not have the receipt yet. \nThis debt was paid as verified by the credit report of September 8, 2008. Applicant \nwrote on the credit report of September 8, 2008, that the debt of $648, as alleged in \nSOR\u00b6 1.d, was paid on September 19, 2008. She stated that she did not have the \nreceipt yet. Applicant wrote on the credit report of April 18, 2008, that she would pay the \ndebts of $198 and $58, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, on May 9, 2008. The credit \nreport of September 8, 2008, verifies that both debts were paid in May 2008.5 \n \n \nApplicant paid the $20 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g in March 2008. \nApplicant wrote on the credit report of April 18, 2008, that she would pay the $178 \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, on May 9, 2008.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant only recently paid many of the debts and a few are still owed. Applicant \nhas not been financially stable long enough to warrant the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(a). Much \nof her financial problems can be linked to an abusive relationship. Her former \ncompanion did not maintain the rent payments on their apartment after she moved out. \nShe has since paid the landlord and most of her other delinquent debts. She acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by paying her landlord. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She also had medical debts including those incurred by her \npregnant daughter. Applicant does not merit application of AG \u00b6 20(b) for the medical \ndebts in the SOR because there is insufficient evidence to tie them to her daughter. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received counseling for her financial \nproblems, but she has paid most of her delinquent debts. There are clear indications \nthat her financial problems are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and \n20(d) are applicable. Applicant denied owing several debts that no longer appear on her \ncredit report, as discussed in the Findings of Fact. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those \ndebts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant fled an abusive \nrelationship which created some financial difficulties. She has been working at resolving \nher delinquent debts now that she is on her feet. She provided documentation that most \nof her debts have been paid. Her assertions that other debts have been paid or will be \n\n \n8 \n \npaid merit some weight because previous similar assertions have, for the most part, \nbeen proven to be true. She still has some delinquent debts but is clearly on the right \npath. The Appeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required to establish that she \nhas paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must \ndemonstrate that she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d14 Applicant has met those \nrequirements. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nWill A. Gunn, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 7, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 25, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n\u201c[T]here are six questions on the [SCA] concerning an applicant\u2019s police record.  The first four, to include\n1\nalcohol-related charges and convictions, are not limited by times.  Only the last two, concerning military convictions and\nany other convictions or criminal matters not mentioned in the previous questions, are limited by time.  The question\nconcerning alcohol incidents clearly state[s] an applicant should list any arrests or convictions that are alcohol-related.\nA reasonable and educated person like Applicant with a Master\u2019s degree would know that the alcohol-related question\nis not limited by time.  A person with eight driving while intoxicated offenses in his past more reasonably would not want\nthat information revealed when applying for access to classified information.\u201d  Decision at 7. \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in his formal finding against Applicant as to subparagraph 1(l) of the SOR\n2\n(\u201cYou continue to consume alcohol despite your alcohol related arrests and treatment.\u201d)  He points to record evidence\nthat he ceased consuming alcohol in June 2007 and believes that the Judge\u2019s formal finding is inconsistent with the\nevidence in the record.  The Board has considered this argument.  While the Judge could have modified the allegation\nto conform to the evidence, under the facts of this case his failure to do so has not prejudiced Applicant.  Applicant  also\nargues that the Judge erred in his formal finding against Applicant on subparagraph 1(k) (\u201cYou received alcohol\ncounseling at [counseling center] in July of 2002.\u201d), contending that this is inconsistent with an adverse clearance\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence was erroneous; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had deliberately\nfalsified his security clearance application (SCA); and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant holds a Master\u2019s degree\nin computer science and has been a program manager, or deputy program manager, for a defense\ncontractor for over three years.  Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol on eight occasions between January 1984 and March 1991.  In addition, he was\nconvicted of driving while intoxicated in March and again in May of 2002.  As a result of this last\nincident, he was directed to attend alcohol counseling, which he completed in 2002.  The counselor\ntold Applicant to stop drinking, but he continued to drink moderately.  The SCA required Applicant\nto list any arrests for alcohol-related offenses.  Applicant listed the two incidents in 2002, but he did\nnot list the eight incidents in the 1980s and 1990s.  Applicant stopped consuming alcohol in June\n2007, following an injurious automobile wreck.  \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s weighing of certain pieces of evidence, e.g.,\nApplicant\u2019s job accomplishments and community service.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.8(f).  However, a\nJudge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically states\notherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See  ISCR Case\nNo. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008).\nFurthermore, the Judge\u2019s finding as to the deliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omissions on the\nSCA is sustainable, viewed in light of the record as a whole .  The Board concludes that  the Judge\n1\nhas drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his ultimate adverse security clearance\ndecision, both as regards the Guidelines G and E mitigating conditions and the whole-person\nfactors.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\n2\n\ndecision.  However, viewed in context of the record as a whole, which includes evidence that Applicant continued to\ndrink after his counselor advised him to abstain, the Judge\u2019s formal finding is not error.  \nAss\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).   The Judge\u2019s decision that\n\u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant\u201d is\nsustainable on this record, in light of the standard set forth in Department of the Navy v.

On April 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for alcohol consumption and personal conduct under Guidelines G and E.  \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 16, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 17, 2008.  Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations under Guideline G concerning driving while intoxicated offenses and \nalcohol counseling.  He denied that he continues to consume alcohol.  He also denied \nfalsification of his security clearance application by failing to list all of his driving while \nintoxicated offenses.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge and \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 31, 2008.  The case was \nassigned to me on August 4, 2008, and DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 13, \n2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 9, 2008.  The government \noffered two exhibits, marked Gov. Ex. 1-2, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant submitted 2 exhibits, marked App. Ex. A-B, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on September 18, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and has been a program manager or deputy program \nmanager for a defense contractor for over three years.  He is a college graduate with a \nmaster's degree in computer science.  He is married with three children.  He previously \nreceived clearance for a position of public trust.  However, he has not previously applied \nfor or been granted access to classified information (Tr. 32-36; Gov. Ex. I, e-QIP, dated \nFebruary 13, 2007; See, App. Ex. A, Family picture, undated).   \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested, charged, and convicted of driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol in January 1984, January 1985, November 1986, January 1987, \nOctober 1989, August 1990, January 1991, and March 1991 (SOR 1. a-h).  Applicant \nadmitted to continuing to drink alcohol between 1991 and 2002.  Applicant admitted he \nwas arrested, charged with, and convicted of driving while intoxicated in March 2002, \nand May 2002 (SOR 1. i-j).  Applicant admitted that as a result of these offenses, he \nwas directed to attend alcohol counseling (SOR 1.k).  He completed alcohol counseling \nin July 2002 (Tr. 14-16, 38-40, Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated Jun 8, 2008, at 190-\n194, 197-203, See, Response to SOR, dated April 17, 2008). \n \nThe eight driving while intoxicated offenses happened when Applicant was a \ncollege student in his 20s.  He wishes that the authorities had punished him more \nseverely so that he would have stopped drinking (Tr. 14-16).  After 1991, Applicant did \nnot stop drinking alcohol but curtailed his alcohol consumption extensively.  He only \ndrank occasionally with family or at family events, usually once a year at social events \nor on a holiday.  He married in 1991, changed his lifestyle, and started to live differently.  \nHe attended church regularly.  Alcohol consumption was no longer a part of his lifestyle \nbut he had not yet made a commitment to stop drinking alcohol.  In 1991, he would not \nhave considered that he had an alcohol problem, but he now realizes he has an alcohol \nproblem (Tr. 14-16, 39-40, 43-44, 70-71). \n \nIn March 2002 and again in May 2002 when he was 39 years old and on a \nbusiness trip for his employer, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated.  He \nknew it was wrong to drink and drive.  The only time he did drink and drive was on the \ntwo business trips.  He was convicted, and sentenced each time for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol.  He should have decided before these incidents to not drink alcohol \nbut he did continue to drink occasionally.  He did not see the fault in drinking alcohol, so \nhe drank on occasion with clients.  His continued drinking clouded his judgment and put \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhim in a situation where he drank and drove.  He knows now that he should not have \nbeen drinking alcohol at all.  As an adult, he should not let drinking cloud his judgment \nand then get behind the wheel of a car.  In 2002, he would have stated that he had a \ndrinking problem.  He stated that he was not regularly binge drinking but he did have \ntwo binge drinking episodes (Tr. 40-46, 70-71).   \n \nAs a result of the May 2002 incident, Applicant was required to attend an alcohol \nand driving counseling program.  Applicant attended and completed the program as \nrequired.  Applicant continues to see his counselor but not on a routine scheduled \npermanent basis.  He sees his counselor only when he thinks he wants to discuss \nissues with her.  As a result of this counseling, Applicant realized that he needed to stop \ndrinking alcohol.  The counselor told him to stop drinking but he did not completely \nagree with her suggestion.  He continued to drink moderately, but never drank to \nexcess.  At most, he consumed about one drink any time he drank alcohol (Tr. 70-75). \n \nIn June 2007, he was severely injured in an automobile accident when he was hit \nfrom the rear.  Applicant decided that he no longer could drink alcohol because of his \ninjuries and the realization what his family and life meant to him.  Alcohol consumption \nno longer suited him.  He had a nice family, was active in his church, and was receiving \nnew and higher jobs and responsibility from his employer.  The alcohol counseling, his \nchurch pastor, and church members were instrumental in helping him stop drinking.  His \nlast drink of alcohol was in June 2007.  He does not drink alcohol now.  He was not told \nby the doctors after his accident not to drink alcohol, but he realizes he can no longer \ndrink alcohol.  In response to interrogatories in January 2008, Applicant noted he \ncurrently drank about two drinks once every two or three months. He stated he was \nreferring to what he may drink in the future and not to the alcohol he was then \nconsuming.  Applicant noted that he drank alcohol in 2002 not as a result of his travels \nbut because he would drink on special occasions and had not yet decided not to drink \nalcohol.  His current position with his employer requires him to travel.  His wife will \naccompany him on some of the trips since he needs help managing his baggage \nbecause of his automobile accident injuries.  He stated that he will not drink alcohol to \nexcess in the future based on his changed lifestyle, his work with his family and church, \nand the people around him understanding that he does not drink (Tr. 17-24, 49-52, 61-\n69, 75-80; See, Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated June 8, 2008 at 182-189).   \n \nIn answering question 23(d) on the security clearance application concerning any \narrest for drug or alcohol-related incidents, Applicant state he did not list his driving \nwhile intoxicated offense from 1984 until 1991 because he thought he only had to go \nback seven years.  He had experience completing the SF 85P which has a time limit of \nseven years.  He did not carefully read the questionnaire and limited his response to the \nlast seven years.  He did list his 2002 driving while intoxicated arrests and convictions \nand his 2002 alcohol-related counseling.  He did not remember all of his convictions in \nthe 1980s but he would have remembered some of them.  Applicant stated that the \ndriving while intoxicated offenses in the 1980s coupled with the 2002 offenses may \nindicate to security officials that he had an alcohol problem.  However, he believes the \nolder offenses would not be an issue in granting him an interim security clearance \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbecause the offenses were so old and would not change the outcome of his being \ngranted an interim clearance or a final clearance.  His failure to list the offenses would \nnot have been a factor in his interim clearance (Tr. 53-60). \n \nHis pastor noted that Applicant has been a key member of the church for over 15 \nyears and instrumental in their fund raising efforts.  Applicant served in various \nleadership positions and meets with local officials in support of the church's programs.  \nHe is a Sunday school teacher and takes part in other spiritual aspects of the church \nprograms.  He has shown consistency, reliability, leadership, ethical conduct, and \nloyalty (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated May 23, 2008).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s driving while intoxicated arrests and convictions from 1984 until 1991 \nand in 2002 raise Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) \n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC \nDC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent).  The driving while intoxicated incidents are alcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work.  Eight driving while intoxicated offenses in seven years (1984-1991) and two \ndriving while intoxicated arrests and convictions within two months in 2002 are \nindications of binge or habitual consumption of alcohol.  \n \n \nSOR (allegation 1.l.) states that Applicant continued to consume alcohol after his \narrests and counseling for alcohol.  Applicant admitted to consuming alcohol after his \narrest and counseling but that he stopped drinking alcohol in June 2007.  There is no \nindication of consumption of alcohol after June 2007, so the allegation is correct only \nuntil June 2007.   \n \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 \n22(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15).  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government (See, ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n \nApplicant has raised by his testimony Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions \n(AC MC) AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); AC MC \nAG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \n\n \n6 \n \n \nalcohol abuser); and AC MC AG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed \ninpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized treatment program).   \n \n \nThere were eight incidents of driving while intoxicated from 1984 until 1991.  \nThere was a period of eleven years before the next series of driving while intoxicated \nincidents.  During those eleven years, Applicant continued to drink alcohol but at a \nreduced level.  In 2002, there were two incidents of driving while intoxicated in less than \ntwo months.  Thereafter, Applicant continued to consume alcohol although again at a \nreduced level until June 2007 when he completely stopped consuming alcohol.  While \nthere has not been an alcohol-related incident since 2002, Applicant drank alcohol from \n1984 until 2007, a period of 23 years.  He stopped consuming alcohol only a year ago.  \nThere has not been sufficient time of no alcohol consumption compared to the years \nthat he did consume alcohol.  The alcohol-related incidents are frequent since there \nwere ten driving while intoxicated offenses.  The early incidents happened when \nApplicant was young and in his 20s and the later incidents happened when Applicant \nwas on business trips.  None of these incidents happened under unusual \ncircumstances.  They took place under normal and standard living circumstances for a \nperson attending school or working.  \n \n \nApplicant does acknowledge that he should not drink alcohol.  He also attended \nand completed alcohol-related counseling, and has seen his counselor but not in a \nrecurring standard scheduled program.  Applicant's information concerning actions \ntaken to overcome his problem or to establish a clear pattern of modified consumption is \nlimited to Applicant's own statements that he no longer consumes alcohol.  This is not \nsufficient to show that he has taken clear and effective steps to overcome his alcohol-\nrelated problems.  There was eleven years between alcohol-elated incidents and \nApplicant continued to drink during that time.  It has been six years since his last \nincident but only one year since he stopped drinking alcohol.  Applicant has not \npresented sufficient information show that alcohol-related incidents will not recur.  He \nhas not mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false information, the security \nclearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified \ninformation is in the best interest of the United States Government.  Applicant's failure to \nlist his eight driving while intoxicated offenses from 1984 until 1991 on his security \nclearance application raises a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nCondition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibility).   \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  While there is a security concern for an \nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the government when applying for a security clearance, not every \nomission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is a falsification.  A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant did \nnot list the 1984 to 1991 driving while intoxicated offenses because he believed he only \nhad to list offense that took place in the last seven years.  He completed applications for \npublic trust positions in the past and the questions on those applications concerning \npolice record are limited by the seven year time frame.  However, there are six \nquestions on the e-QIP security clearance application concerning an applicant's police \nrecord.  The first four, to include alcohol-related charges and conviction, are not limited \nby times.  Only the last two, concerning military convictions and any other convictions or \ncriminal matters not mentioned in the previous questions, are limited by time.  The \nquestion concerning alcohol incidents clearly state an applicant should list any arrests \nor convictions that are alcohol-related.  A reasonable and educated person like \nApplicant with a Master's degree would know that the alcohol-related question is not \nlimited by time.  A person with eight driving while intoxicated offenses in his past more \nreasonably would not want that information revealed when applying for access to \nclassified information.  I find that Applicant deliberately did not list his 1984-1991 \nalcohol-related charges and convictions on his security clearance application.   \n \n \nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand determine none apply.  Applicant never made a good faith effort to correct \nerroneous or inaccurate information.  While Applicant eventually admitted the alcohol-\nrelated offenses, it was in response to question from security investigators and not on \nhis own initiative (See, Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated June 8, 2008).   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n8 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI have considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness.  I have considered Applicant's service to his community \nand his church.  I considered that he is regarded as honest and trustworthy and an \nexcellent employee.  However, Applicant had ten alcohol-related incidents and received \ncounseling for alcohol consumption.  He only stopped using alcohol, by his own \nadmission, last year.  He deliberately did not provide full information about his alcohol-\nrelated arrests on his security clearance application and did not reveal his early alcohol-\nrelated arrests or convictions until questioned by security investigators.  Applicant has \nnot presented sufficient information to show that his consumption of alcohol is not of \nsecurity concern.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nthat Applicant will not consume alcohol to excess in the future.  I have doubts about his \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance because he did not provide complete \nand full information on his security clearance application.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct.  I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are; \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.  \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________ \nThomas M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.a and 1.j. She is a 26- year-old human resources assistant employed by a defense contractor since February 2006. She has not previously held a clearance. The SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 16 delinquent debts totaling over $15,000. Applicant admits 14 debts totaling nearly $12,000. Nine of the debts are for unpaid medical expenses totaling nearly $4,200. Another nine debts were $500 or less, three being less than $100. Applicant asserts, and record evidence confirms, that the $445 debt at SOR 1.j. belongs to her husband\u2014she being only an authorized user on the account. Record evidence also establishes that the judgment alleged at SOR 1.a. was satisfied in April 2008 (A.E. A), and the debts at SOR 1.c. and 1.d. were paid in July 2008 (A.E. B, C). Applicant\u2019s finances were so tight that on at least two different occasions between December 2004 and March 2005, she used counterfeit currency (that she knew to be counterfeit) to pay road tolls. She was ultimately arrested and fined for this offense. In the two weeks before the hearing, Applicant contacted an on-line credit counseling organization that proposed a repayment schedule for her 12 remaining debts (approximately $11,700) that would have them paid by May 2013 (A.E.

Applicant answered the SOR 3 May 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 28 May 2008, and I convened a hearing 14 July 2008. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 21 July 2008.\n \nJuly 29, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.a and 1.j. She is a 26-\nyear-old human resources assistant employed by a defense contractor since February\n2006. She has not previously held a clearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 16 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $15,000. Applicant admits 14 debts totaling nearly $12,000. Nine of the\ndebts are for unpaid medical expenses totaling nearly $4,200. Another nine debts were\n$500 or less, three being less than $100. Applicant asserts, and record evidence\nconfirms, that the $445 debt at SOR 1.j. belongs to her husband\u2014she being only an\nauthorized user on the account. Record evidence also establishes that the judgment\nalleged at SOR 1.a. was satisfied in April 2008 (A.E. A), and the debts at SOR 1.c. and\n1.d. were paid in July 2008 (A.E. B, C). Applicant\u2019s finances were so tight that on at\nleast two different occasions between December 2004 and March 2005, she used\ncounterfeit currency (that she knew to be counterfeit) to pay road tolls. She was\nultimately arrested and fined for this offense.\nIn the two weeks before the hearing, Applicant contacted an on-line credit\ncounseling organization that proposed a repayment schedule for her 12 remaining debts\n(approximately $11,700) that would have them paid by May 2013 (A.E. D, E). However,\nshe had not yet begun payments, nor did she demonstrate that her creditors had\naccepted the proposed repayment schedule.\nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to chronic medical problems that she\nhad when not covered by health insurance, and related brief periods of unemployment\nfrom December 2005 to February 2006, December 2004 to July 2005, and May to\nSeptember 2004. Her current job provides health coverage, and she underwent\ncorrective surgery for her chronic condition in August 2007. Applicant\u2019s work and\ncharacter references (A.E. F) consider her honest and reliable.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n3\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a lengthy history of\nfinancial difficulties, which is ongoing.  Although Applicant appears to be taking tentative\n3\nsteps to address her debts, she has not reached a stage where her ultimate success\nseems likely.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  Even if I accept that the debts are\n4\nlargely due to her medical issues, and thus due to circumstances beyond her control,\nshe has not acted responsibly overall in addressing her debts.  Even though several of\n5\nthe debts were relatively small, she took no steps to address any of them until she\nreceived the SOR. Her evidence that she has sought credit counseling demonstrates\nonly a start toward financial stability. She has not otherwise brought the problem under\ncontrol.  The few debts paid have been paid only recently, not in a timely, good-faith\n6\n\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\neffort.  The best case view of Applicant\u2019s circumstances is that it is still too early to tell\n7\nwhether her goal of financial stability will be achieved. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nAt hearing, Department Counsel took the position that the passage of time since\nApplicant\u2019s use of counterfeit currency was sufficient to mitigate the security concerns\nraised under criminal conduct. The gravamen of that conduct was the Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial straits at the time of the crime. I conclude Guideline J for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

His parents, oldest son, and siblings are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan. Applicant has substantially more connections to the United States \nthan to Sudan. After a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \nevidence, I conclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under guideline B, foreign influence. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance.

On March 28, 2008, I was assigned the case. On April 14, \n2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on April 22, 2008. \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through H, which were \nadmitted into evidence. On May 9, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Sudan. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) 1\u250010. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanation, the factual \nallegations of the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old interpreter who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince October 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.

(Answer to SOR, Ex 2, Tr. 121) His \nfather has tuberculosis and Applicant sent him $200 per month for a total of $1,300 to \ncover the cost of food, medical treatment, and medicine. In Sudan, a person is expected \nto bring their bed and mattress for any hospital stay. Tuberculosis patients routinely \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\nunder go six-month treatments. Applicant was serving in Iraq when he learned of his \nfather\u2019s illness. (Tr. 85)  \n \nSouthern Sudan is made up of ten providences. (Tr. 37) In 1969, the first civil war \nbetween North and South Sudan started. It ended with a 1972 peace agreement. (Tr. \n39) In 1982, a new civil war started. The people of the South are targeted and terrorized \nby Northern Central government forces. Life in the South is very difficult. (Tr. 40) A 2005 \npeace agreement stated Southern Sudan is to be independent until 2011. (Tr. 77) In \n1987, Applicant was in his first year of high school when there was an attempt on his \nlife. People were shooting into his house and he had to flee to a church. Applicant has \nalso been beaten several times by government security forces. (Tr. 38, 42) \n \nApplicant spent six months hiding in the jungle before walking to Khartoum and \ninto a UN displaced persons camp. (Tr. 83) At university in Khartoum, Applicant studied \nArabic/English translation. He first began studying Arabic at age seven. (Tr. 106) \nApplicant speaks English, Dinka, Gbaya, and Arabic. (Tr. 159) In 1997, after graduating \nfrom the university, Applicant decided to leave Sudan. (Tr. 40)  \n \nIt was in 1987 that Applicant last saw his family except for his half-brother who \nlives in the U.S. (Tr. 84) Applicant\u2019s oldest son is 12 years old and is a citizen and \nresident in Sudan. His son is a full time student who Applicant has not had contact with \nsince his son was two. (Tr. 128) Applicant hopes to bring his son to the U.S. His son \ncurrently lives with Applicant\u2019s sister who lives with Applicant\u2019s parents. (Tr. 89) His \nson\u2019s mother died and his son was placed in an orphanage before he went to live with \nApplicant\u2019s sister. (Tr. 123)  \n \n \nApplicant has four brothers, two sisters, a half-brother,2 and three half-sisters \nwho are citizens and residents of Sudan. He has little contact with them. Three of his \nbrothers are students and one is a high school teacher. (Tr. 134) Applicant\u2019s one sister \nis a business owner trading in peanuts and the other is a firefighter. (Tr. 137) Applicant \nhas a half-brother who is a major serving as a medic in the Sudanese Army of the \nSouth. Applicant last talked to this half-brother when Applicant called his father and his \nhalf-brother happened to be there. Applicant had not spoken to this half-brother for \nyears before that call. Applicant\u2019s half-sisters are a teacher, a housewife, and one is \nunemployed. (Tr. 135, 138) Applicant has a half-brother who is a production line worker, \nis a citizen of Sudan, and resides in the U.S. Applicant has nothing to do with this half-\nbrother, who will become a U.S. citizen after completing the five year requirement to live \nin the U.S.  \n \n \nIn September 1997, Applicant fled from Sudan and went to Syria where he was \nemployed in housekeeping duties and washing dishes in a restaurant. (Tr. 45) In \nNovember 1998, he left Syria because of its hostility towards the U.S. and went to \nEgypt. While in Egypt, he worked as a custodian for a Canadian oil company. (Ex. 2, \nEx. D, Tr. 46-49) In Egypt, Applicant met and married his wife, having known her from \n                                                          \n2 Under Sudanese law, a man is allowed to have two wives. (Tr. 145)  His father\u2019s first wife was \nApplicant\u2019s mother.  \n \n3\n\nsouthern Sudan. (Tr. 50) She went to Egypt with her three children. Her husband had \nbeen killed in Sudan by the Sudanese government. (Tr. 52) Two or three of his wife\u2019s \nsiblings had also been killed in Sudan. (Tr. 139-140) \n \n \nIn August 2000, Applicant travel to the U.S. from Egypt, having been granted \nrefugee status by the U.S. His wife came with him to the U.S. She was pregnant with \ntheir first child. He left Egypt on a travel document supplied by the Red Cross, which he \nused only that one time. (Ex. 2) Upon his arrival in the U.S., Applicant mailed the travel \ndocument back to the Red Cross. As a refugee, it was impossible to renew his expired \nSudanese passport.  \n \n \nApplicant obtained a job as a machine operator in a printing company. (Tr. 54) \nHe took classes in the U.S. at a community college on ethics and responsibility in \ntranslations, writing, and reading English. (Tr. 38) After four months as a machine \noperator, Catholic Social Services need someone from the Sudan who could speak the \nlanguage, understand the culture, and was willing to help with the \u201cLost Boys.\u201d (Tr. 55) \nThe \u201cLost Boys\u201d were homeless children from Southern Sudan whose families were \nkilled by the Sudanese government. (Tr. 56) Applicant was hired and supervised 45 \nboys and worked with other refugees. Applicant started working at a non-profit \norganization as a refugee case manager, which continued until October 2006. (Tr. 58) \nHe also worked with a program helping people with mental issues or disabilities. (Tr. 60) \nIn August 2006, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. E)  \n \n \nHis supervisor at the non-profit organization worked with Applicant for \napproximately five years and knew him well. (Tr. 154) While there, Applicant treated \neveryone equitably and conducted himself in an outstanding professional manner. His \nsupervisor testified that she would trust Applicant with her life and the lives of her \nchildren. (Tr. 163) \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant went to work for a defense contractor that had a \ncontract with the U.S. Army to provide Arabic speaking linguists. (Tr. 60, 61) In \nNovember 2006, he went to Iraq and spent 14 months \u2500 from November 2006 to \nJanuary 2008 \u2500 working for the U.S. Army headquarters in Baghdad as a linguist and \nadvisor. (Tr. 66) In January 2008, he returned to the U.S. on leave to see his family. He \nwas not allowed to return to Iraq because he has foreign relatives. If his security \nclearance is granted, he will return to Iraq to continue serving with the U.S. Army. (Tr. \n96) Since returning from Iraq, Applicant called to check on his father, which is the only \ncontact he has had with his foreign relatives. (Tr. 144)  \n \n \nApplicant has had minimum contact with his relatives in Sudan. The majority of \ncontact with his relatives has been through his wife. (Tr. 68) They do not know he \nworked as a translator in Iraq, but believed he works for an oil company. (Tr. 67) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, step-daughter, and two step-sons are citizens of Sudan residing \nwith Applicant in the U.S. His wife is a permanent resident who has applied for \nnaturalization and hopes to become a U.S. citizen within the next two months. (Tr. 36) \nWhen his wife becomes a U.S. citizen, her children, Applicant\u2019s step-children, will also \n \n4\n\nbecome U.S. citizens except for the oldest daughter who would no longer be a minor. \nApplicant has two daughters and a son, ages seven, two, and one, all of whom were \nborn in the U.S. (Ex. 2)  \n  \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant purchased a home with a fair market value of $124,000 on \nwhich he owes $109,000. (Tr. 64) Applicant has $2,500 in a U.S. savings account, \n$3,500 in his checking account, and $10,800 in his 401(k) retirement fund. (Tr. 101) \n \nSudan \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The Northern government in \nSudan is hostile to the U.S. The Southern government is not. Sudan had seventeen \nyears of civil war between 1955 and 1972. (HEx. 1, U.S Department of State, \nBackground Note: Sudan) A peace agreement was signed in 1972 and lasted until \nJanuary 1983, when civil war started again. In January 2005, a Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement was signed, establishing a new Government of National Unity and the \ninterim Government of Southern Sudan. \n \nA rebellion in Darfur resulted in the death of tens of thousands of persons and \nlead to an estimated two million internally displaced persons in Sudan and 234,000 \nrefugees in Chad. (HEx. 1) The Northern Sudanese Government is complicit with the \nbombing, murder, and rape of innocent civilians in Darfur. (HEx. 1) \n \nIn August 1993, Sudan was designated by the Secretary of State as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. (HEx. 6, State Sponsors of Terrorism) Sudan remains on the list \neven though it has aggressively pursued terrorist operations directly involving threats to \nU.S. interest and U.S. personnel in Sudan. (HEx. 7, Country Reports on Terrorism) The \nU.S. government has received indications of terrorist threats aimed at American and \nwestern interests in Sudan to include suicide operations, bombings, or kidnappings. \n(HEx. 2, U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information, Sudan)  \n \nSudan is under a U.S. embargo, with extensive trade restrictions on exports to \nSudan. (HEx. 8, U.S. Department of State, Overview of Treasury and Commerce \nRegulations Affecting U.S. Exports to Sudan). The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. \ncitizens against all travel to Sudan. (HEx. 3, U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning, \nSudan) \n \nThe Government of Sudan\u2019s human rights record has remained poor, and there \nare numerous serious problems including genocide, extrajudicial and unlawful killings, \ntorture, beating, rape, cruel and inhumane treatment by security forces, arbitrary arrest \nand detention, executive interference with the judiciary, denial of due process, \ninfringement of rights to privacy, freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, \nreligion, and movement, the trafficking of persons, violence and discrimination against \nwomen and ethnic minorities, and forced labor. (HEx. 12, U.S. Department of State, \nSudan, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2007) Government security \nforces continue to torture, beat, and harass political opponents. (HEx. 12) The \n \n5\n\ngovernment continues to arbitrarily arrest and detain people under the National Security \nAct. (HEx. 12) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n6\n\n \n7\nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG & 6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and oldest son are citizens and residents of Sudan. \nHis wife and her children are citizens of Sudan, but reside with him in the U.S. His wife \nis a permanent U.S. resident who hopes to get her U.S. citizenship within the next two \nmonths. He also has a half-brother who is a citizen of Sudan living in the U.S. Applicant \nleft Sudan as a refugee first traveling to Syria, then to Egypt before coming to the U.S. \nIn August 2006, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In October 2006, he deployed to \nIraq for 14 months, working with the U.S. military forces.  \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information\u201d apply. \n \nThe new Iraqi government relies upon the U.S. for support as it moves forward \nwith its new form of government. While Iraq=s human rights record under Saddam \nHussein was very dismal and some problems continue, its human rights record is slowly \nimproving under the new government.  \n \nIn every case where parents, children, or siblings live overseas, there is a risk of \npressure on these relatives and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. \nUnder the facts of this case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation pressure, or coercion is not substantiated. Applicant has significant ties to \nthe U.S. and few ties to Sudan. While his parents and siblings live in Sudan, he lives \nwith his wife, children and step-children in the U.S. He has no financial or property \ninterests in Sudan. His three children were born in the U.S. He owns a home in the U.S. \nwhere he maintains his saving account, checking account, and 401(k) retirement plan. \nApplicant=s ties with the U.S. are much stronger than his ties with Sudan. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant worked 14 months as an interpreter supporting the U.S. military \nmission in Iraq. He worked long hours in austere conditions with an ever present risk of \nhostile fire. The Army holds his work in high regard. His commander in Iraq stated \nApplicant is intelligent, unflappable, dependable, reliable, loyal, confident, competent, \nand possessing impeccable oral and written communicative skills. Applicant puts into \npractice the U.S. Army\u2019s values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity \nand personal courage. Applicant\u2019s duty performance was rate as high as possible. He \nexceeded expectations, did exceptional work, had superior job knowledge superior, and \noutstanding judgment outstanding. As his certificate of appreciation states, his diligence \nand proficiency significantly contributed to the moral and life support of the U.S. military \npersonnel.  \n \nIf a heightened risk exists because he has parents and siblings in Sudan, he has \nmitigated that concern under AG & 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign \npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d and AG & 8(b) \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s has a half-brother who is a medic in the Army of Southern Sudan. \nThe southern part of Sudan is pro U.S. and pro west. Applicant has had limited contact \nwith this individual. None of his siblings are involved with organizations which seek to \nharm the U.S. Since 1987, Applicant has not seen his parents, son, or siblings except \nfor his half-brother who lives in the U.S. Since returning from Iraq, he has called his \nfather once to check on his health. During his deployment to Iraq, he did not contact his \nparents or siblings and all communications with them were through his wife. His parents \nand siblings think he is working for an oil company. His parents, son, and siblings have \nnot experienced any repercussions from any source because of Applicant.  \n \nThe Government of Sudan\u2019s human rights record has remained poor, and there \nare numerous serious problems including genocide, extrajudicial and unlawful killings, \ntorture, beating, rape, cruel and inhumane treatment by security forces, and arbitrary \narrest and detention. Life in the South is very difficult. Applicant has no love for the \nGovernment of Sudan. During his first year of high school, there was an attempt on his \nlife and he has been beaten several times by government security forces. He spent six \nmonths hiding in the jungle before walking to a UN displaced persons camp. He left \nSudan as a refugee. Additionally, his wife has no love for the Sudanese government. \nHer former husband and some of her siblings were killed in Sudan by the Sudanese \ngovernment. \n \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n                                                          \nclose ties and his loyalties to the U.S., he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nSince leaving Sudan, Applicant has not returned. His communication with his \nparents is limited and with his siblings almost non existent. Because he guided the Army \npersonal on customs and nuances related to the spoken word, translated documents, \nand responded very well in highly dangerous situations, the Army views him as a \nvaluable resource in helping it achieve its mission in Iraq.3  \n \n \n3In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when \u201can applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \nnational security . . . [and therefore he] can be relied upon to recognize, resist and report a foreign \npower=s attempts at coercion or exploitation.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Sudan, Applicant\u2019s son, parents, \nand siblings are in no greater danger than any other individual living and working in \nSudan.  \n \nAs previously stated neither Applicant nor his wife have any love for the \ngovernment of Sudan. Not only was he beaten by security forces, but his wife\u2019s former \nhusband and some of her siblings were killed in Sudan by the Sudanese government. \nFrequently, Applicant went in harms way to assist U.S. military forces in performing their \nduties in Iraq. The only reason he is not there now is because he lost his clearance \nbecause of his relatives living in Sudan. Should he be granted a clearance, he intends \nto return to Iraq to continue working with the U.S. military. \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhe has four siblings living in Iraq. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant answered the SOR 11 February 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 9 April 2008, and I convened a hearing 7 May\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 15 May 2008.\n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 33-year-old sheet metal foreman\nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2008. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nWhen Applicant first applied for an industrial clearance in May 2006 (G.E. 1),  he\ndeliberately concealed his past marijuana use by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 24 (illegal\ndrug use, last seven years).

He states\nan intent to not use marijuana in the future. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ;\n3\n4\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n5\nof abstinence;\n6\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .; (b) deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation regarding facts to an . . . investigator . . .;\n3\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,  and\n3\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant used marijuana casually for\nfour years beginning in 1992, stopped using it for eight years, then used for more than\nfour years beginning in 2000. This use was neither distant in time nor infrequent.  His\n4\nabstinence from drug use\u2014approximately three years\u2014is inadequate to demonstrate\nan intent to refrain from drug use in the future given that he had abstained for eight\nyears before resuming use in 2000.  I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal\n5\ndrugs in the future.  Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal\ndrug use from the government.  He did so knowing that his illegal drug use was a\n6\nsecurity concern to the government, and believing that his clearance was at risk if he\ntold the truth.\nFurther, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed\ninformation was relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant made no prompt, forthright\n\n4\ndisclosure of his drug history. Indeed, he misrepresented the full extent of that use in his\nFebruary 2007 subject interview.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use demonstrates a lack of candor\nrequired of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant\nand material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance\ndecision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse\ninformation in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient.\nFurther, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides\nsome indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage\nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information.

Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and brother-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Ecuador. His sisters, wife, and daughter are dual citizens of Ecuador \nand the United States living in the United States. His brother is a U.S. citizen living in \nEcuador. Applicant maintains his Ecuadorian citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in Ecuador and because he intends to retire in Ecuador. Applicant has rebutted \nor mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, \nbut has not rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nC, foreign preference. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \n \n \n \n1\nOctober 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                          \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 5, 2008, detailing security concerns \nunder Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence. \n \n \nOn June 10, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJuly 10, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 10, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on August 6, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf. On August 14, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Ecuador. Applicant stated the material did not apply to him \neven though his relatives lived in Ecuador because he had no professional or business \nties to Ecuador. (Tr. 16) The attached documents were not admitted into evidence but \nwere included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I. The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old systems engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince May 1983, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn 1975, Applicant starting working at a tracking station in Ecuador. (Tr. 21) In \n1979, the tracking station closed and he came to the U.S. (Tr. 21) In 1982, he obtained \nhis permanent U.S. residence status. In May 1983, he obtained employment with his \npresent employer. In February 1995, he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \n \nIn 1973, Applicant married. His wife was born in Ecuador and became a U.S. \ncitizen in April 1988. In 1976, Applicant\u2019s daughter was born in Ecuador. In 1995,2 she \nbecame a U.S. citizen and works as a social worker. (Tr. 23) In 1978, Applicant\u2019s son \nwas born in Ecuador. In 1995, he became a U.S. citizen and is studying criminology at \nan American university. (Tr. 23)  \n \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 In 1995, when Applicant became a U.S. citizen, his children who were minors also became U.S. \ncitizens.   \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant\u2019s mother \u2013 age 95 \u2013 is a citizen and resident of Ecuador who lives on a \npension. His father is deceased. He has biweekly telephone contact with his mother. \n(Ex. 1, p. 55) One of his sisters is deceased; another \u2013 age 60 \u2013 is a citizen and \nresident of Ecuador and is an English teacher. (Tr. 28, Ex. 3, p. 71) He talks with this \nsister biweekly by telephone. (Ex. 2, p. 56) Applicant and his siblings send his mother \nand sister in Ecuador $300 per month. His share is $50 per month. (Tr. 28) \n \nApplicant\u2019s one brother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1979 and his other \nbrother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994. (Ex. 1, p. 20 \u2013 22) Another sister is a \n68 year old house wife living in England. Applicant rarely contacts her, once every two \nyears, and his last physical contact was five years ago. (Tr. 24, Ex. 2, p. 55, Ex. 3, p. \n78) Two other sisters became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1978 and 1994. (Ex. 1, p. 24 \u2013 \n26) His one brother and two sisters who are naturalized U.S. citizens live in the U.S. In \n2007, one brother moved back to Ecuador to establish temporary residency. (Ex. 3, p. \n71) This brother comes back and forth between Ecuador and the U.S. (Tr. 36)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a U.S legal resident living in Ecuador who spends six \nmonths of each year in the U.S. and six months in Ecuador. (Tr. 37, Ex. 3, p. 76, 81) \nWhen she is in the U.S., she lives with Applicant and his wife. His mother-in-law and \nfather-in-law separated 45 years ago and Applicant is unsure if his father-in-law is still \nalive. (Ex. 1, p. 28) His brother-in-law is a retired accountant and a citizen and resident \nof Ecuador. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and brother-in-law live together in Ecuador. \nApplicant talks by telephone with his mother-in-law two or three times a month and talks \nweekly with his brother-in-law in Ecuador. (Ex. 2, p. 56, Ex. 3, p. 79) None of his \nrelatives have held political office or are politically active.  \n \nIn 1979, prior to coming to the U.S., Applicant purchased a townhome and an \nunimproved lot in Ecuador. (Tr. 33) Two weeks prior to the hearing, Applicant sold the \ntownhome for $35,000 and intends to build a new home. He also owns an executive \nsuite. Applicant obtained a $50,000 loan from his 401(k) retirement plan to purchase the \nexecutive suite in Ecuador. Applicant rents out the executive suite for $400 per month. \n(Tr. 30) Applicant has $3,500 in a saving account in Ecuador comprised of rent received \non the executive suite and he has $36,000 from the sale of his townhome in a bank \naccount in Ecuador.  \n \nIn the U.S., Applicant has $346,000 in his 401 (k) retirement plan, owns a home \nin the U.S. worth $275,000 on which he has a $70,000 mortgage, owns four vehicles in \nthe U.S. worth $37,000 on which he makes monthly payments of $575, has $9,000 in \nhis credit union account, and his other property in the U.S. is worth $22,000. (Tr. 24 \u2013 \n26, Ex. 2, p. 65) Applicant has no professional or business ties to anyone in Ecuador. \n(Tr. 16)  \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant voted in an election in Ecuador. (Ex. 2, p. 65) A voter \ncertificate is needed to conduct most legal transactions in Ecuador. Applicant must vote \nin Ecuadorian elections to maintain his Ecuadorian citizenship. Applicant maintains his \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nEcuadorian citizenship to protect assets from future laws pertaining to eminent domain. \n(Ex. 2, p. 65) Applicant is unwilling to renounce his Ecuadorian citizenship because he \nis afraid the Ecuadorian government might take his property. (Tr. 13) Applicant intends \nto return to Ecuador when he retires in the next two to two and a half years. (Tr. 25) In \nOctober \u2013 November 2001, February 2002, October \u2013 November 2002, August \u2013 \nSeptember 2004, January 2005, and July 2005, Applicant traveled to Ecuador on \ncompany business. In February 2007, Applicant went to Ecuador to attend his sister\u2019s \nfuneral. (Ex. 3, p. 78) \n \nEcuador \n \n \nEcuador is a constitutional republic whose government is democratically elected, \nalthough none of the last three democratically elected presidents finished their terms \nbecause of political instability.3 \n \n \nEcuador has a record for respecting human rights.4 Ecuador\u2019s constitution bars \ntorture and similar forms of intimidation and punishment, as well as arbitrary arrest and \ndetention. Its constitution also provides for an independent judiciary. Still, human rights \norganizations report incidents of police torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment. Criminal kidnapping for profit has continued to be a problem in \ncertain regions of the country, and there have been reported cases of arbitrary arrest \nand detention. Political and economic pressures and corruption in the national police \nand the courts have also been reported and remain a source of continuing U.S. \nconcern.5 \n \n \nThe U.S. remains concerned about the high levels of corruption in Ecuador, \nwhich, according to Transparency International, rivals those of Congo, Iraq, Sierra \nLeone, and Uganda and makes Ecuador the second most corrupt nation in South \nAmerica.6 \n \n \nEcuador has a mixed record as to the protection of foreign property rights. Twice \nin the last half-century, it has nationalized the property of U.S. firms.7 For many years, \nthe U.S. and Ecuador have maintained close ties based on a shared interest in \n \n3 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Background Note: Ecuador, \nJanuary 2008 at 3 (Background Note).

Since 1998, at least ten U.S. citizens have been kidnapped near Ecuador\u2019s \nborder with Colombia and one killed.11  \n \n \nEcuador has continued to work closely with the U.S. to promote lawful economic \nactivity and Ecuador\u2019s Congress has ratified the Inter-American Convention against \nTerrorism.12 All in all, Ecuador remains a friendly country with democratic institutions \nand strong inter-governmental relations with the U.S. Historically, the country has \nshown little inclination to coerce or pressure U.S. citizens to provide classified or \nproprietary data, or in any way attempt to compromise sensitive and classified U.S. \nInformation. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n8 Background Note at 6. (HEx I) \n \n9 U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator of Counterterrorism, Country Reports on \nTerrorism, Chapter 2 \u2013 Country Reports: Western Hemisphere Overview, dated April 30, 2008 (Terrorism) \nat 8.

(Consular Information) (HEx I) \n  \n12 Terrorism at 2. (HEx I) \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \n\n \n \n \n7\nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual=s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation;  \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; [and] \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nApplicant\u2019s wife and children were born in Ecuador and are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens living in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s mother, who he helps support, and sister are \ncitizens and residents of Ecuador. His one brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen who \nspends part of the year in Ecuador and part in the U.S. Applicant has a sister who lives \nin England. His other three siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens living in the U.S. His \nmother-in-law is a U.S legal resident who spends six months of each year in the U.S. \nand six months in Ecuador. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a retired accountant and a \ncitizen and resident of Ecuador.  \n \n Having considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, \napplicable conditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) and AG \n& 7(b), which apply. AG & 7(d) does not apply even though his wife was born in \nEcuador, because she is a U.S. citizen living in the U.S., which negates any potential for \nadverse foreign influence or duress. AG & 7(e) partially applies because Applicant owns \nproperty in Ecuador and does not wish to give up his Ecuadorian citizenship for fear of \nlosing the property. The property is not \u201csubstantial\u201d when compared to his U.S. \nproperty, but is of concern.  \n \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority.  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; [and] \n \n\n \n \n \n9\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nAG && 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Applicant talks with his mother, sister, \nmother-in-law, and brother-in-law a couple of times each month. Because of his limited \ncontact with them, \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be place in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interest of [his relatives and in-laws] and the interest of the U.S. \u201cThere is \nlittle likelihood that [his relationship with his Ecuadorian relatives and in-laws] could \ncreate a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nAG & 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his mother, siblings, mother-in-\nlaw or brother-in-law are or have been a political activists, challenging the policies of the \nEcuadorian Government. There is no evidence his relatives or in-laws currently work or \never worked for the Ecuadorian Government, military, or news media, or that of any \nother foreign government. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Ecuadorian \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant or his relatives and in-laws for \nany reason. There is no evidence that his relatives and in-laws living in Ecuador \ncurrently engages in activities which would bring attention to them or that other \nEcuadorian elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced \npossibility that his relatives and in-laws or Applicant would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d His wife, children, brother, and two sisters are U.S. citizens, and all reside in \nthe United States. Another brother is a U.S. citizen who travels between Ecuador and \nthe U.S. and another sister lives in the U.K. However, his mother, sister, mother-in-law, \nand brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Ecuador. Applicant was born in \nEcuador. He came to the U.S. in 1979 and became a U.S. citizen on February, 1995. \nHe has worked for defense contractors since 1975.  \n \nAG & 8 (f) partially applies because he has property in Ecuador. However, he \nhas significant U.S. property and assets. These mitigating conditions taken together are \nsufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG & 9 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: Foreign \nPreference is a security concern when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates.  \n \n\n \n \n \n10\nAG & 10 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. \nThis includes but is not limited to: \n \n \n \n(1) possession and/or use of a foreign passport; \n \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in the foreign country; \n \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American \ncitizen; \n  \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve \nthe interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict \nwith the national security interest; [and] \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the \nUnited States; for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States \ncitizenship; renunciation of United states citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant votes in Ecuadorian elections because he needs the voter certificate to \nconduct legal transactions in Ecuador. Applicant votes in Ecuadorian elections in order \nto maintain his Ecuadorian citizenship. He maintains his Ecuadorian citizenship to \nprotect assets from the possibility of eminent domain. He is unwilling to renounce his \nEcuadorian citizenship because he is afraid he might lose his Ecuadorian property. \nApplicant intends to retire in the next two to two and a half years, return to Ecuador, and \nbuild a home in Ecuador. He has chosen to keep his foreign citizenship so he can keep \nhis foreign property. AG && 10(a) (5) and 10(a) (7) apply \n \n  \nAG & 11 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry; \n \n \n \n(b) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; \n \n\n \n \n \n11\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated; [and] \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has chosen to actively \nmaintain his Ecuadorian citizenship in order to protect his Ecuadorian property. He \nvoted in foreign elections not because the U.S. Government encouraged it, but because \nhe needed to prove he voted in order to transact business in Ecuador and to prove his \nEcuadorian citizenship. The foreign preference concerns have not been mitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n12\nIn the more than 29 years since he left Ecuador, Applicant returned six times for \ncompany business and only once, in February 2007, for personal reasons to attend his \nsister\u2019s funeral. I have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhis mother, siblings, and in-laws are living in Ecuador or because he plans to retire in \nEcuador. It is not his Ecuadorian relatives or in-laws or future retirement plans that \nprovide concern. Future plans are merely speculative until they occur. When and if he \nretires to Ecuador is uncertain. \n \nWhat is of security concern is his decision to maintain his Ecuadorian citizenship \nin order to protect his Ecuadorian property. He votes in foreign elections specifically to \nmaintain his foreign citizenship. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concern, but failed \nto mitigate the foreign preference security concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.j.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nTimothy Aiken, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 16, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 1, 2012, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s consideration of\n\nconduct not contained in the SOR denied Applicant due process and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable\nfindings under Guidelines F and M are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed in the field\nof information technology.  He has worked for his current employer since March 2011.  Applicant\nserved in the Navy during 1997.  He did not complete basic training, receiving a general discharge\nunder honorable conditions after a positive urinalysis for marijuana.  \nPreviously Applicant worked for another Defense contractor.  During that period of\nemployment, Applicant was alleged to have created directory files and scripts without obtaining\npermission from the system administrator.  Applicant stated that he was not aware that his conduct\nwas wrongful.  Although he was found to have been trying to minimize the risk of operator error\nrather than to have been acting maliciously, the Government client requested that he be removed\nfrom the contract.  Applicant submitted a resignation in lieu of dismissal due to these allegations.\nHowever, his employer rehired him several days later.\nIn completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant denied that he had, within\nthe previous seven years, been fired from a job, quit, or left under unfavorable circumstances.\nMoreover, in response to questions about his discharge from the Navy, he advised a security\nclearance investigator that it was the result of a knee injury.  He did not disclose his failed drug test.\nApplicant testified that he had told the investigator about the drug test, but that the investigator had\nnot included it in the summary of Applicant\u2019s interview.  However, when the summary was\npresented to Applicant as part of a series of DOHA interrogatories in 2009, Applicant certified that\nthe summary was accurate.  This apparent false statement was not alleged in the SOR.   \nIn the Analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s SCA omission was intentional.  In so\ndoing, the Judge considered the plain language of the question at issue, as well as the uncharged\nmisconduct regarding his failed drug test.  The Judge stated that he was considering this misconduct\nin performing his credibility determination.  The Judge ultimately concluded that Applicant had not\nmitigated the concerns arising from his omission to the SCA.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by considering the uncharged misconduct.  He stated\nthat he had not been placed on notice that this evidence would be considered and that by doing so\nthe Judge had denied him an opportunity to prepare his case.  This evidence was contained in\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated January 12, 2010.  Applicant did not\nobject to the admission of this exhibit.  Tr. at 15.  The Directive requires a Department Counsel to\nprovide an applicant with a copy of all documentary evidence to be submitted at a hearing (Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.13).  The exhibit is cited several times in the transcript, and there is nothing in the record to\nsuggest that Department Counsel failed to provide Applicant with a copy.  See ISCR Case No. 07-\n18324 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2011) (Federal agencies are entitled to a presumption of good faith\nand regularity in the performance of their responsibilities).  Moreover, conduct not alleged in a SOR\nmay be considered for a number of reasons, including assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility.  See, e.g.,\n\n1Cf. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that evidence of uncharged acts may be considered for a number\nof reasons, including proof of intent, motive, and lack of mistake. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).1  This is the context which the Judge\ndiscussed the challenged evidence.  Accordingly, we conclude that Applicant was not denied the due\nprocess afforded by the Directive.   \n  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Bildman, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations and information technology\nsecurity concerns, but failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concern.\nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn June 16, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF, financial considerations, M, use of information technology, and E, personal conduct.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the  adjudicative guidelines (AG)\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on December 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2011, denying all of the allegations\nexcept 1.a, and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 31,\nFebruary 1, 2012\n\n2\n2011. A notice of hearing was issued on November 14, 2011, scheduling the case for\nDecember 1, 2011. I held the hearing as scheduled and received nine Government\nexhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, and 17 Applicant Exhibits\n(AE) marked as AE A through Q. Also, I considered the testimony of Applicant and a\ncharacter witness.\nAt the close of the hearing, I left the record open, at Applicant\u2019s request, for the\nsubmission of an additional exhibit. Within the time allotted, Applicant submitted the\nadditional exhibit. Department Counsel had no objection, and I admitted it as AE R.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 9, 2011. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old married man with four children, The oldest three are\nteenagers from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce in 2003. The youngest is\nseven years old. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife has physical custody of the two oldest teenagers,\nand Applicant has physical custody of the youngest teenager. (Tr. 25) Applicant is a\nhigh school graduate and has taken some college courses.\nApplicant works in the information technology field. He has earned several\ninformation technology certifications over the years. Applicant has worked for his current\nemployer since March 2011. \nFrom 2003 to approximately 2010, Applicant accrued approximately $22,000 of\ndelinquent debt. (Tr. 28) Applicant owes the majority, totalling approximately $15,000, to\na car company (subparagraph 1.a). This debt became delinquent in 2007. (GE 5 at 2)\nThe remainder of the delinquencies include a credit card account (subparagraph 1.b),\nutilities (subparagraphs 1.c, 1h), a medical account (subparagraph 1.d), another\nautomobile delinquency (subparagraph 1.e), two student loan accounts (subparagraphs\n1.f and 1.g), and two miscellaneous delinquencies (subparagraphs 1.I, 1.j).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stem from his 2003 divorce, and were exacerbated\nwhen his current wife lost her job in 2010. (Tr. 48) She remains unemployed. (Tr. 47)\nSince beginning his current job, Applicant\u2019s salary has increased by $20,000. (Tr.\n33) He has several hundred dollars of after-expense monthly income. (Tr. 48)  This has\nenabled him to begin satisfying his delinquencies. As of the hearing date, Applicant had\nsatisfied all of the debts except subparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, and 1.i. \nApplicant contacted the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.a. It agreed to reduce\nthe delinquency by half, but insisted on the payment in a lump sum, which Applicant\ncould not afford. (Tr. 31) Applicant\u2019s supervisor, the chief executive officer of the\ncompany, testified. He was so impressed with Applicant\u2019s work quality that he agreed to\npay the debt and deduct it from a future \u201cbonus or profit share . . .\u201d (Tr. 84) The day\nafter the hearing, Applicant submitted a copy of the check, drawn from his employer\u2019s\naccount, satisfying subparagraph 1.a. (AE R)\n\nApplicant and his father share the same name.\n1\n3\nApplicant disputes subparagraphs 1.g and 1.i. Subparagraph 1.g is an allegedly\ndelinquent student loan totalling $3,527. Applicant contends this is his father\u2019s debt.1\nNeither the age of the debtor listed on the bill nor the social security number of the\ndebtor matches Applicant. (Compare AE G and GE 1 at 1) Applicant submitted\nevidence showing that his student loan account is current. (AE F) I find that Applicant\nhas only one student loan account, as listed in subparagraph 1.i, and it is current.  \nSubparagraph 1.i is a debt allegedly owed to a book club totalling $70. Applicant\ndisputes this debt, but has been unsuccessful in contacting the original creditor.\nBefore Applicant worked for his current employer, he worked, among other\nplaces, for another defense contractor between 1998 and 2003. (GE 1 at 16) His duties\nincluded assisting the Government employees with using their information technology\nsystem, \u201cchanging system tapes for backups, balancing daily logs, and running system\nscripts.\u201d (Tr. 37)\nOn January 24, 2003, the Government client of Applicant\u2019s employer alleged that\nhe created directory files and scripts within a larger directory without obtaining\npermission from the Government\u2019s system administrator. Also, Applicant was alleged to\nhave installed an editor within the system directory without the system administrator\u2019s\nprior review. (GE 4 at 3) \nThe Government system administrator who reported these problems noted that\nApplicant did not act with \u201cmalicious intent,\u201d and was actually trying to improve or\nminimize the risk of operator error. (GE 4 at 3) However, he \u201cdid not think to ask the\nappropriate personnel for permission,\u201d nor did he first inquire about the \u201crules and\nregulations that govern creating, editing, and modifying such files. (GE 4 at 3)\nBased on theses alleged information technology infractions, the Government\nclient of Applicant\u2019s employer asked that he be removed from the contract. When\nApplicant\u2019s employer confronted him with these allegations, Applicant stated that he\nwas unaware that he had committed any information technology infractions. Also, he\nasserted he had no reason to believe he was violating protocol because one of the\nonsite Government employees helped him download the editor. (GE 4 at 3) The system\nadministrator who reported Applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct acknowledged that a\nGovernment employee helped Applicant, but noted that he was not in her chain of\ncommand.\nApplicant\u2019s employer, after reviewing the allegations against him, told him to sign\na resignation in lieu of dismissal, but told him to \u201chang tight,\u201d and promised to re-hire\nhim as soon as an employment opportunity on another contract arose. Applicant then\nresigned. Nine days later, his employer re-hired him and assigned him to another\ncontract. (AE E at 3) Applicant continued to work with his employer for another six\n\n4\nweeks before leaving to take another position. He had no additional adverse incidents\nfor the remainder of his stint with his employer.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on October 3, 2006. He\nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 22: Employment Record . . . e. Last 7 years,\nfired, quit, or left/unfavorable circumstances?\u201d (GE 1 at 34) Applicant testified that he\ndid not consider that his employer in 2003 released him under unfavorable\ncircumstances after asking him to resign, because they rehired him to work on another\ncontract, as promised, within ten days of his resignation.  \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1997. He did not complete basic training,\nas he received a general discharge after testing positive for marijuana. (Tr. 56, 97) In\nresponse to questions about his discharge from an investigative agent in 2006,\nApplicant stated it occurred after he experienced a knee problem. (GE 2 at 10) He did\nnot disclose that he had failed a drug test. (GE 2 at 10)\nDuring cross-examination, Applicant testified that he told the investigative agent\nof the failed drug test, and that the investigator\u2019s interview summary inaccurately\nexcluded it. (Tr. 57) In late 2009, DOHA propounded interrogatories to Applicant. (GE 2)\nAttached to the interrogatories was a copy of the investigator\u2019s summary of Applicant\u2019s\npersonal subject interview. (GE 2 at 10) Question 3 asked whether the summary\naccurately reflected the information that Applicant provided to the investigator. Applicant\nanswered, \u201cYes.\u201d (GE 2 at 8)\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel  . . . \u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s financial struggles trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant did not elaborate about his 2003 divorce and how it contributed to his\nfinancial problems. Moreover, his most significant delinquency, the car loan listed in\nsubparagraph 1.a, became delinquent four years after the divorce. Nevertheless, since\nobtaining his current job with a significantly higher salary, Applicant has contacted his\ncreditors and satisfied all of the delinquencies except subparagraph 1.a, 1.g, and 1.i.\nAlthough Applicant had not satisfied subparagraph 1.a as of the hearing date, he did\nmake good-faith efforts to develop a payment plan. When these efforts were\nunsuccessful, his boss paid the debt for him, and will develop a repayment plan\nwhereupon Applicant will repay him through either a reduced future bonus, or reduced\nprofit-share.\nApplicant provided evidence successfully disputing the student loan listed in\nsubparagraph 1.g. The only unresolved debt is 1.i, a disputed debt less than $100\ndollars. I conclude that all of the mitigating conditions apply. \n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s omission from his security clearance application of a job that he\nresigned from under adverse circumstances raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a),\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant contends that the circumstances of his resignation\nfrom his job in 2003 is not covered under Section 22 of the security clearance\napplication because his employer was not taking a punitive action when it asked him to\nresign in lieu of termination. Rather, they were simply removing him from the contract\nand taking him off the payroll until another contract opportunity became available. \nAccording to the Appeal Board, \u201chowever narrowly [an] applicant seeks to\ncharacterize . . . the facts and circumstances, applicant[s] are bound by the plain\nlanguage of the question,\u201d when completing a security clearance application. (ISCR\nCase No. 98-0470 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 1999)) Consequently, although the credibility of\nApplicant\u2019s contention is bolstered by the fact that the company re-hired him within two\nweeks of his resignation, I am unable to conclude the omission was unintentional.\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I considered his cross-examination\nresponses to questions regarding the circumstances surrounding his discharge from the\nNavy. Specifically, when asked why he did not tell the investigative agent in 2006 that a\nfailed drug test led to his general discharge, he provided an explanation that\ncontradicted his 2006 interrogatory responses. In considering this information, I am\ncognizant that the SOR does not allege any other falsifications. However, unlisted\nadverse information has probative value in weighing an applicant\u2019s credibility. I conclude\nApplicant intended to conceal the circumstances of his resignation when he omitted it\nfrom his security clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation.\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nUnder this guideline, \u201cnoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39)\nInformation technology systems include \u201call related computer hardware, software,\n\n7\nfirmware, and data used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation,\nstorage, or protection of information.\u201d (Id.)\nApplicant committed several information technology infractions including creating\nscripts within a directory and installing an editor without permission. The disqualifying\nconditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other\ninformation technology system,\u201d and 40(f), \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of\nhardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any information technology system\nwithout authorization when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations,\u201d\napply.\nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational\nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s\npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily\navailable; and\n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a\nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor.\nApplicant modified his company\u2019s Government client\u2019s information technology\nsystem to make it better-organized, improve its efficiency, and make it more fail-safe. In\nthe process, he was unaware he was violating any Government regulations or protocol,\nand had no reason to know he was violating any regulations or protocol because a\nGovernment employee was assisting him in completing the tasks.\nBefore this episode in 2003, Applicant had no history of information technology\nviolations, and has committed none since then. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) and 41(b) apply, and the\nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 41(c)  applies.\nSubparagraph 3.b of the Guideline M paragraph cross-alleges the falsification\nallegation set forth in Guideline E, subparagraph 2.a. Although Applicant\u2019s conduct, as\nset forth under subparagraph 2.a, constitutes a security concern under Guideline E, the\nconduct is not covered under Guideline M. Consequently, I have resolved subparagraph\n3.b in Applicant\u2019s favor, not because the underlying conduct was mitigated, but because\nthe Government erroneously alleged it under Guideline M. \n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant deserves credit for mitigating the financial considerations security\nconcern. Also, his job performance is so outstanding that his employer paid his most\nsignificant delinquency, in an effort to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s misuse\nof information technology was minor, isolated, and remote in time. Applicant however,\nfailed to overcome the negative ramifications of his falsification of his 2006 security\nclearance application. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant answered the SOR 15 May 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 11 August 2008, and I convened a hearing 28 August 2008.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 11 September 2008.\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.a. She is a 36-year-old\nsecretary employed by a defense contractor since January 2007. She previously held a\nclearance 1997-2001.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, seven delinquent debts\ntotaling over $21,000. Applicant admits all but one debt for $178, paid 10 days before\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant attributes her financial problems to her June 2008\ndivorce and unemployment from September 2004 to December 2005. The record\nprovides insufficient support for her assertions, demonstrating too, that Applicant had\nfinancial problems before those events.\nApplicant\u2019s clearance application (G.E. 1) reflects that Applicant was continuously\nemployed from at least September 1997 to September 2004, before voluntarily\nresigning her government job. She states, without corroboration of the circumstances or\nthe reasons those circumstances required her to resign, that she resigned because her\nmother was ill and she had a high risk pregnancy. Her child was born in mid-August\n2005, more than a year after she resigned her job. She returned to work in December\n2005, and has been continuously, if sometimes under-employed since.\nApplicant failed to withhold sufficient federal income tax from her salary in 2001,\nand was assessed interest and penalties on top of the shortfall. However, she failed to\nadjust her withholding the following year, and again owed taxes, interest, and penalties.\nApplicant claims, without corroboration, that she entered into a repayment agreement\nwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and began paying her delinquent taxes. There\nis no evidence to indicate whether or not this was in response to an IRS lien. She\nstopped these payments in 2004 when she resigned her government job. In the\nmeantime, Applicant failed to withhold sufficient income tax in 2003 and 2004, and the\nIRS filed a $9,000 income tax lien against her in June 2005 for tax years 2001, 2002,\n2003, and 2004. According to Applicant, she also owes back taxes for 2007, which she\nhas included in her offer-in-compromise to the IRS (A.E. D).\nApplicant claims, again without corroboration, to have restarted payments to the\nIRS after she regained employment in December 2005, claiming that she set up a direct\npayment through her company. However, when she changed jobs, the automatic\npayment stopped, and she did not restart it with her new employer. She states, without\ncorroboration, that she entered into a new payment schedule with the IRS in January\n2008, and made five payments before being temporarily laid off because of her lack of a\nclearance. \nApplicant\u2019s payment history with her educational loans (dating back to 1994 when\nshe graduated from college) follows a similar arc to her IRS payments, except that she\nhas been making payments since February 2008 (A.E. B). Her payment history shows\nthat her total debt had increased to over $20,000. Her account is listed as current,\n\n3\nalthough she is considered to be in rehabilitation status with the loan authority. Her\ncurrent balance is $19,500.\nApplicant married in January 2006, separated from her husband in June 2008,\nand was divorced in June 2008. She provided no evidence how her divorce affected her\nfinances.\nApplicant claimed, without much credibility, that she was unaware of her past due\ndebts until she was confronted with them during subject interviews in August and\nSeptember 2007. She moved a couple of times, but did not provide her creditors with\nher new addresses. Applicant provided evidence that she reached settlements with the\ncreditors at SOR 1.e. (for 60% of the debt) and 1.f. (for 15% of the debt) after the SOR\nwas issued, and paid those creditors. She provided proof of payment for the debts at\nSOR 1.c. and 1.d. during the same time frame.\nApplicant currently lives with her mother. She has provided no work or character\nreferences. She has not received financial counseling; nor has she demonstrated that\nshe has a budget.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n3\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n4\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. The short summary is that government\nrecords, and Applicant\u2019s own documents, establish her accumulated indebtedness over\nseveral years.  She failed to corroborate her claimed reasons for the indebtedness.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s unemployment certainly contributed to her financial difficulties, as did no\ndoubt and her separation and divorce. But Applicant was having financial problems\nbefore any of these events occurred. She had tax problems with the IRS before she\nresigned her government job or got married, and the fact that she was able to make\npayments on an agreed plan with the IRS, does not obscure the fact that she both\nunder withheld federal tax for several years (and failed to correct that issue), and\napparently lacked the resources to pay the delinquent taxes without entering into a\nrepayment plan. Even if I accepted Applicant\u2019s characterization that the debts were due\nto circumstances beyond her control, Applicant had the burden to demonstrate that she\nhad taken responsible action to address the debts. She has not done so. Only the debt\nat SOR 1.a. appears to have been paid as a result of her subject interviews in 2007.\nThe remainder were addressed (to the extent they were addressed) in the wake of the\nSOR.\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide mixed help to\nApplicant. Her financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  Her evidence is\n4\ninsufficient to clearly establish that her financial problems were largely due to\ncircumstances beyond her control. Nor can it be said that she has acted responsibly\noverall in addressing her debts, having taken action mostly after the SOR was issued.5\nShe has not demonstrated that the problem has been brought substantially under\ncontrol.  She did not produce a budget showing that she lives within her means. Part of\n6\nthe resolution of her financial problems relies on her obtaining relief from the IRS\nthrough her offer in compromise, by no means a sure thing, and in any event not a\nmitigating condition for financial concerns. She cannot be said to have paid her debts in\n\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n5\na timely, good-faith effort.  It is not even clear that she now has the means to get and\n7\nkeep her financial house in order. Nevertheless, the best case view of Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances is that it is still too early to tell whether her goal of financial stability will\nbe achieved.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on January 8, 2007. On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 2, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 17, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. On August 15, 2008, a Notice \nof Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2008. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 4, without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nfive exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, and admitted \nOctober 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwithout objection. The record was held open until September 25, 2008, to allow \nApplicant to offer additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a 14 page document \nwhich was admitted as AE F. Department Counsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission is marked as Hearing Exhibit 1.  DOHA received the transcript of \nhearing on September 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn July 17, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a motion to amend the SOR \nand forwarded the amendment to Applicant. The motion to amend added language to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. On July 30, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR amendment. I conclude \nApplicant had adequate notice of the motion to amend. There being no objection to the \namendment from Applicant at hearing, the amendment was allowed in accordance with \nEnclosure 3, Additional Procedural Guidance, of the Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.17.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, a minor amendment the SOR \u00b6 1.a was made on the third \nline down, by changing the word \u201cof\u201d located between the words \u201calcohol\u201d and \u201cdrugs\u201d to \nword \u201cor\u201d due to a typographical error.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, and in his Answer to the Amendment to the SOR,  \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old computer technician employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor for the past five years. He served 12 years on active duty in the \nUnited States Navy. He separated as an E-6 with an Honorable Discharge. He has \nworked for defense contractors since separating from active duty. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1991 with no security incidents. His highest level of education \nis an associates degree. He is married and has one son, age 24, from a previous \nmarriage. (Tr at 4-6, 54; Gov 1; AE F.) \n \nIn 2003, Applicant worked as a contractor on a military installation located in \nGermany. On July 8, 2003, Applicant played in a softball tournament and later \nvolunteered to work in a booth during a fest held on the military installation. He and a \ncouple friends went out after the fest was over around midnight. Applicant drank \napproximately four to five half liters of alcohol. (Tr at 35-36, 39.)   \n \nAround 2 am, Applicant drove home. He was stopped by a German police officer. \nThe German police officer smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath. He was told to lock his \ncar. He was put in the German police vehicle and taken to the German police station. At \nthe station, his blood was taken and paperwork was filled out.  The military police \narrived and Applicant was transported to the military police station. More paperwork was \ncompleted. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was confiscated and his base driving privileges \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwere revoked. He was released about an hour later. His car was recovered the next \nday.  (Tr at 37-41; Gov 3.) \n \nOn the night of his apprehension, the only document Applicant received was a \nDA Form 4137, Evidence/Property Custody Document related to his driver\u2019s license \nbeing confiscated.  Applicant consulted a judge advocate about whether any charges \nwere being brought against him. She advised him that they were waiting for information \nfrom the German police.  Applicant transferred back to the U.S. in September 2003. He \nwas scheduled to transfer back to the U.S. prior to his apprehension. He was given his \nlicense back just prior to moving back to the U.S.  In October 2003 after he moved to \nthe U.S., he called the judge advocate again. She indicated that they had received no \ninformation from the German police.  (Tr at 27, 41; Gov 4; AE A.) \n \nWhile Applicant admits that he was arrested by the German police, he did not \nbelieve that charges were ever filed against him. He believed that administrative actions \nwere taken rather than criminal charges filed.  He initially was not sure that it was an \narrest.  He was not handcuffed or put in a jail cell. He was not photographed. No \nfingerprints were taken. It was his belief that these sort of actions would occur if he had \nbeen arrested. (Tr at 43; Answer to SOR; Answer to Amendment to SOR.)     \n \nOn January 8, 2007, Applicant submitted an e-QIP application as part of a \nperiodic background investigation related to his security clearance. (Gov 1.) He \nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d in response to section 23(d) which asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged \nor convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d (Gov 2) Applicant answered \n\u201cNo\u201d because he believed he was never charged with any offense. (Tr at 50; Answer to \nSOR.) \n \nOn the same e-QIP application, Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to section \n23(f) which asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out \ntraffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d \nApplicant understood this question asked about other incidents that may have \nhappened for which he was arrested.  In his response to the amendment to the SOR, he \nindicated, \u201cI understood the question to refer to incidents other than ones already \naddressed by previous questions. This is also why I responded to the OPM investigator \nin this same fashion. As I stated in my last answer this was something that I should \nhave asked for clarification about but failed to do so.\u201d (Gov 1; Gov 2; Answer to \nAmendment to SOR.)  \n \nIt is also alleged that Applicant deliberately provided false information when he \ninitially confirmed his negative responses on his security clearance application during an \ninterview with an employee of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Specifically, \nhe denied having been charged with or convicted of any charges associated with the \nuse of alcohol or drugs.  The evidence in support of this allegation is a summary of the \npersonal subject interview contained in the report of investigation apparently prepared \nby the OPM investigator. During the interview, the investigator specifically asked \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwhether Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any charges associated \nwith the use of alcohol of drugs. Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d. The investigator disclosed \nthat the government was aware of his arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol \nin Germany in July 2003. Applicant admitted he had been arrested and discussed the \narrest in detail. (Gov 4.) Applicant admits that disclosure of his arrest had the potential \nto have a negative impact on his security clearance. (Tr at 45.)   \n \nApplicant maintains that the questions on the e-QIP application are not as clear \nas the questions pertaining to arrest history on previous applications. He provided a \nprevious version of the security clearance application which asks the following \npertaining to arrest history \u201c18(a) Have you ever been arrested, charged, cited, held, or \ndetained by Federal, State of other law enforcement or juvenile authorities regardless of \nwhether the charge was dropped or dismissed or you were found not guilty?\u201d He \nindicated he would have listed the arrest in response to this question. (Tr at 45-50; AE \nB.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife wrote a letter on his behalf.  They married in March 2006. They \nbegan dating when they both were working in Germany. She has no firsthand \nknowledge of the July 2003 incident because she was sightseeing in another country. \nApplicant immediately told her about the incident. She is aware that his license was \ntaken by the military police. He never received negative counseling by his employer. He \ncontinued to work in a classified environment.  His driver\u2019s license was returned when \nhe moved back to the U.S. He contacted the judge advocate\u2019s office on at least two \noccasions. Having lived in Germany, she is aware that German authorities impose \nsignificant fines on individuals charged with DUIs. As far as they both know, no charges \nwere ever imposed or fines levied.  She states her husband is honest and trustworthy. \nHe is a good father and husband. Applicant has always held his security clearance in \nhigh regard and would never jeopardize national security. (AE C.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager has known Applicant since January 2007. Applicant has \nbeen one of the best and most reliable people he has working for him.  Applicant is a \nvery valuable team member because of his attention to detail and ability to figure out \nsome of the most difficult problems. He is also willing to lend a hand to fellow team \nmembers. He socializes with Applicant outside of work and values him as a friend and \nmentor. (AE F at 10.)  \n \nA family friend of Applicant\u2019s has known him for three years. Their families spend \nalmost every weekend together. She states Applicant is a very honest and kind \nindividual with an extremely high level of integrity. When her mother underwent \nchemotherapy and radiation treatment for lung cancer, he would visit her every \nSaturday. He displayed a lot of compassion and concern. He serves as a mentor to her \nson. Applicant is an individual with strong morals and integrity. (AE D.) \n \nA performance appraisal covering January 22, 2007 to December 31, 2007, \nindicates that Applicant exceeds expectations. (AE E.) He was awarded numerous \n\n \n5 \n \n \nawards and commendations during his Navy career. He has earned four Microsoft \ncertifications which enhances his ability to make a contribution at work. (AE F.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThere are specific disqualifying conditions which may be raised. The following \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) potentially apply to the facts of this \ncase: \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) potentially applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to list his July 2003 \narrest on his e-QIP application dated January 8, 2007. Applicant denies that he \nintentionally falsified his e-QIP application by omitting this arrest in response to section \n23(d) which reads: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) \nrelated to alcohol of drugs?\u201d and 23(f) which reads: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, \nc, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was \nalcohol or drug-related.)\u201d  \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct of circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant claims that he responded \u201cNo\u201d to section 23(d) because he believed he \nwas never formally charged after his apprehension in Germany in July 2003. I find his \nexplanation credible.  Applicant is not a lawyer. Although he was taken to the police \nstation and his driver\u2019s license was revoked. He never received any official documents \npertaining to charges or a court date. Applicant contacted the local staff judge \n\n \n7 \n \n \nadvocate\u2019s office prior to leaving Germany in September 2003 and after he transferred \nback to the U.S. in October 2003. The judge advocate\u2019s office had no information as to \nwhether the German authorities were going to pursue charges.  \n \n \nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to section 23(f) because he believed that question \npertained to arrests, charges or convictions for offenses that were not mentioned in the \nprevious four questions sections 23(a) \u2013 23(e).  I find his explanation credible.  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative) potentially applies in regards to the SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. It is alleged Applicant deliberately provided false information to an OPM employee  \nduring a July 9, 2007, interview when he denied having been charged with or convicted \nof any charges associated with the use of alcohol or drugs.  \n \n \nApplicant initially confirmed his negative response on his e-QIP application \npertaining to his arrest history during an interview with an OPM employee on July 9, \n2007. As mentioned above, Applicant was under the belief that he was never charged \nwith or convicted of any alcohol or drug offenses.  When the OPM employee mentioned \nthat they had information that he was arrested for DUI in Germany in July 2003, \nApplicant acknowledged the arrest and provided additional details related to the arrest.  \nWhile Applicant acknowledged that he knew that his arrest would potentially have a \nnegative impact on his security clearance, his explanation that he believed that he was \nnot charged or convicted of any alcohol or drug offense(s) remains plausible.    \n \n \nI find Applicant did not intentionally withhold information about his 2003 arrest on \nhis security clearance application or during his subsequent interview on July 9, 2007.  \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 17-year \nhistory of handling classified information with no security incidents. I considered his \nrecord of military service and his favorable duty performance. Although Applicant admits \nin hindsight that he should have asked for clarification when completing his security \nclearance application, his explanation for not listing the July 2003 arrest for DUI is \ncredible.  His explanation for not initially disclosing the arrest during an interview about \nhis background investigation on July 9, 2007 is also credible. Applicant learned a very \ndifficult lesson. He understands that on future security clearance applications, he should \nerr on providing too much information as opposed to minimal information.  \n \nI find for Applicant under Personal Conduct. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts in various amounts for a total of about $23,022. It also alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996, although the case was dismissed due to failure to file the required schedules. And it alleges that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in 2007 for $32,029. In a detailed six-page Answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations except for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.n, and 1.o, and he provided explanations for his situation in general and for each debt. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 36-year-old engineer.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 23, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nDecember 3, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 30, 2008, and\nhe requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on September 24, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 2, 2008. \nThe record was kept open until October 8, 2008, to provide Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. He did so, and those matters\nwere forwarded to me by department counsel who raised no objections. Accordingly,\nApplicant\u2019s resume or CV is admitted as Exhibit K. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts in various amounts for a\ntotal of about $23,022. It also alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\n1996, although the case was dismissed due to failure to file the required schedules. And\nit alleges that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in 2007 for $32,029. In a\ndetailed six-page Answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations except for the debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.n, and 1.o, and he provided explanations for his situation in general and\nfor each debt. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old engineer. He has worked for his current employer\nsince December 2005, and he has received two promotions in pay grade in the last\nthree years. His annual gross income is approximately $100,000. He is assigned to a\ndepartment that works on advanced systems and technology, and he serves as a\ntechnical lead for the company on various Defense Department programs. His work has\nincluded filing 22 provisional patents in the last 24 months. His wife, whom he married in\nJune 2008, is employed as an engineer by the same company. Together, they have a\ngross income of more than $200,000 per year.  \nHis employment history includes military service in the U.S. Army, which ended\nin an honorable discharge in 1996. Thereafter, his primary occupation was student, as\nhe earned a B.S. in physics in 2000 with a GPA of 3.81 on a 4.0 scale. He continued his\nstudies earning a Ph.D. in physics in 2004 with a GPA of 3.96 on a 4.0 scale. In addition\n\n3\nto his studies, Applicant worked as a research scientist for the same university during\n1999\u20132005. \nHis personal history includes three marriages with the first two ending in divorce.\nHe has a child from his first marriage, and he pays $900 per month in child support and\nis current with that obligation. \nHis first marriage from May 1993 to about June 1995 coincided with his service\nas an enlisted solider in the Army that ended in 1996. Young and in debt from the\nmarriage, Applicant sought relief by filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in June 1996\n(Exhibit 6). The bankruptcy court dismissed his case a few months later due to failure to\nfile the required schedules. Applicant explained he elected to allow this to happen\nbecause he decided to resolve the debts himself rather than through bankruptcy.\nDuring 2003\u20132005, he became involved as a founding scientist for a startup\ncompany. It did not succeed and ceased operations in about October 2005. As founding\nscientist, Applicant was essentially self-employed as a consultant for the company. In\nturn, this resulted in the IRS tax debt when Applicant did not pay the required self-\nemployment taxes. In September 2007, the IRS took collection action against Applicant\nfor tax-period 2005 via a federal tax lien for $32,029 (Exhibits 7 and H). Sometime\nthereafter, Applicant entered into an installment payment agreement with the IRS at the\nrate of $400 per month. As of July 2, 2008, the current balance was $34,345, which\nincludes penalty and interest. Applicant wants to pay this off sooner than scheduled by\nmaking additional payments. \nHe married his second wife in 2001 when he was a graduate student. They lived\nin apartments until they bought a home in about July 2005. The debt for $5,079 alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.d stems from an apartment they lived in from March 2003 to July 2005.\nApplicant denies this debt and maintains the apartment was clean and without damage\nwhen they departed. He has attempted to resolve the debt via calls and letters without\nsuccess (Exhibit A). He is willing to pay the debt if the company can provide an\naccounting to justify it. Otherwise, he does not intend to pay this debt. \nApplicant\u2019s second marriage ended in 2006, a few months after he completed his\nsecurity-clearance application (Exhibit 1) and about a year after they bought the home.\nApplicant never saw it coming and was taken by surprise by this circumstance. He was\nleft with a mortgage loan and a car loan, both based on a two-income household, and\nhis child-support obligation. As a result, Applicant became delinquent on many bills as\nhe admits in response to the SOR. \nThe two small debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o, which Applicant denied, are\nincluded in the IRS tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x. Otherwise, Applicant has paid or settled the\nother debts alleged in the SOR except as otherwise noted. He established this by his\ntestimony (which I found credible) and his documentary evidence (Exhibits B, C, D, E,\nF, G, I, and J). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n4\nTwo exceptions are the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.t. The debt in \u00b6 1.m\nis for $1,100, and Applicant is attempting to determine the status of the account, to\ninclude the current creditor. He is willing and able to pay it once he confirms the account\n(Answer; Tr. 53, 61). The $1,621 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.t stems from a car loan Applicant\nhad several years ago (Answer; Tr. 63). He contacted the creditor and has been\ninformed he does not owe any money. This debt does not appear on recent credit\nreports (Exhibits 3 and 4). \nThe third exception is the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p, which alleges Applicant was\npast due on the mortgage loan for the house from his second marriage. The mortgage\nloan had an adjustable interest rate and Applicant fell behind when the rate adjusted\nhigher. The mortgage loan is now current (Tr. 62, 75\u201376). Applicant is now renting this\nhome as he relocated in connection with his job and third marriage in June 2008. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n5\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n6\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The bankruptcy case, the\n17\nfederal tax lien, and the other delinquent debts are more than sufficient to establish\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and three justify discussion.\nFirst, Applicant receives credit in mitigation under MC 2 because his financial\nproblems, in large part, resulted from his divorces in 1996 and 2006, and he has acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. For the first divorce in 1996, Applicant acted\nresponsibly by deciding not to purse the Chapter 7 bankruptcy to conclusion and\ninstead resolved the debt himself. For the second divorce in 2006, Applicant acted\nresponsibly by taking on most of the marital debt, to include the mortgage loan and car\nloan. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132 (listing nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept). \n18\n7\nSecond, Applicant receives credit under MC 4. Financially, Applicant is a bit\nscattered or haphazard. He would be wise to spend more time and brain power (of\nwhich he has plenty) staying on top of money matters and learning about the subject of\npersonal finance, which would provide him an opportunity to achieve financial success.\nNevertheless, his efforts to pay his creditors and enter into an installment payment\nagreement with the IRS is sufficient to qualify as initiating a good-faith effort within the\nmeaning of the guideline. \nThird, Applicant receives credit under MC 5. He disputes the $5,079 debt with a\nformer landlord and has provided documented proof to establish the basis for the\ndispute (Exhibit A). \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept  was given due consideration and that analysis supports a\n18\nfavorable decision. Applicant appears to be a highly educated and successful engineer\nwith the potential to increase his income as he has already done with his current\nemployer. He has sufficient financial means (a household gross income of more than\n$200,000 per year) to resolve any remaining delinquent debts should they be\nestablished, adhere to his agreement with the IRS, and remain current on his bills and\nexpenses. Likewise, with such income, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress in the context of classified information is remote. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.y:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established\nby substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old supervisor of a call center. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since October 2002. He was promoted to his current position in June\n2003. His annual salary is about $62,000. His employment history includes military\nservice in the U.S. Marine Corps that ended with his honorable discharge. His first\nmarriage ended in divorce. He remarried in 2004. His wife is currently self-employed\nearning an irregular income that averages about $1,000 monthly.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. The\ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the\nadmitted evidence (Exhibits 2 and 3). He denied the two medical debts because he\ndoes not recognize them and has been unable to find any information on them. To date,\nApplicant has not paid, settled, or otherwise resolved any of the debts. \nHe traces the origin of his financial problems to the period shortly after his\nsecond marriage in December 2004. When they married, Applicant and his wife had two\nhomes (his and hers) and they decided to do a major renovation of the larger home.\nAbout six months later in June 2005, Applicant had a serious motorcycle accident. He\nwas hospitalized for about two weeks, which included time in intensive care. As a result,\nhe was out-of-work on short-term disability, at two-thirds pay, for about three months.\nThe loss of income resulted in delaying the home renovations and he started to fall\nbehind on bills. Also, he incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses that were not covered\n\n3\nby his health insurance. Applicant and his wife began to rely on credit cards during this\nperiod. \nApplicant\u2019s wife lost her job in 2006. She was unemployed for about three\nmonths. The resulting loss of income caused them to fall further behind and continue to\ndelay the home renovation project.\nIn about January 2006, Applicant and his spouse obtained the services of a\ncompany engaged in debt settlement or repayment. They paid a fee of about $400 per\nmonth for about 12 months without any results. Dissatisfied, they terminated their\nrelationship with the company as they continued to fall further behind on their bills. \nIn about January 2007, they stopped making all credit card payments and\ndevoted their money for necessities and for the home renovation for which Applicant\nwas doing most of the work during his free time. Completing the renovations was\nnecessary because without them the home was neither livable nor sellable. \nIn about January 2008, Applicant injured his back during a slip-and-fall accident\nat a neighborhood store. Medical examination of Applicant discovered preexisting back\ninjuries. He initially received a course of non-surgical treatment until it was determined\nthat surgery was necessary. The May 2008 surgery involved the fusing of vertebrae.\nThe full course of medical treatment put Applicant out-of-work on short-term disability, at\ntwo-thirds pay, for about five months from March 2008 until he returned to work on\nabout August 18, 2008. \nHe elected to return to full-time work sooner than recommended due to his\nmounting financial problems. Also, he started a part-time job working at a home-\nimprovement store in August 2008. He earns $10 per hour and grosses about $1,000\nper month.\nApplicant and his spouse considered bankruptcy, but instead have decided to\nattempt to pay or settle their debts. The general plan is as follows:\n\u2022\nRenovations are nearly complete and they expect to move into the larger home\nin early October 2008.\n\u2022\nAfter the move, they will prepare and clean the smaller home and put it on the\nmarket for sale. They plan to price the property aggressively to sell it as quickly\nas market conditions permit. They think they can sell it within a year and net\nanywhere from $30,000 to $40,000, which they will use to pay or settle the debts.\n\u2022\nIn addition, together they have about $26,000 in 401(k) plans that they can\nwithdraw funds from to pay or settle the debts. \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132 (listing nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept). \n18\n6\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and the most pertinent here is MC 2,\nwhich concerns events or circumstances largely beyond a person\u2019s control. \nApplicant receives credit in mitigation under MC 2 because his financial problems\nresulted from events or circumstances largely beyond his control and were not due to a\nlavish lifestyle or general financial irresponsibility. Those events or circumstances were\nas follows: 1) his motorcycle accident and resulting loss of income in 2005; 2) his wife\u2019s\nunemployment in 2006; 3) the unsuccessful effort to resolve debt via the debt-\nsettlement company in 2006; and 4) his back injury and surgery and resulting loss of\nincome in 2008. Taken together, these matters had a snowball or cumulative effect, the\nconsequences of which Applicant is still experiencing. It is apparent that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems would not have occurred but for these events or circumstances.  \nIn addition, Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He\nreturned to full-time employment a few months ago in August 2008, and he started a\nsecond job the same month. With their move to the renovated home in October 2008,\nApplicant and his wife are putting themselves in a position where they can address their\ndelinquent debts. They have a reasonable plan, and although it contains contingencies,\nit is likely to allow them to generate addition money to use in repaying or settling their\ndebts.\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept  was given due consideration and that analysis supports a\n18\n\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d). \n19\n7\nfavorable decision. Having had the opportunity to listen to his testimony (which I found\ncredible) and observe his demeanor, I am persuaded that Applicant has both the\nintention and self-discipline to follow through and resolve his delinquent debts once he\nhas the means to do so.  Indeed, looking forward to the next 12 to 18 months, it is likely\nthat he will successfully resolve his financial problems.  And his financial problems are\n19\nunlikely to recur given that they occurred under rather unusual circumstances. This case\nis decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated February 8, 2008, Applicant, who resides and works\nprimarily in Europe, answered the SOR allegations by admitting all four allegations\nraised. She also presented information to be considered in mitigation. The case was\nultimately assigned to me on May 27, 2008. Because of her travel schedule, Applicant\nJuly 28, 2008\n\n  Tr. 8-9.\n    1\n2\ninitially requested that the hearing not be held in June 2008. That request was granted.\nA subsequent request for another extension was denied and a video-teleconference\nhearing was set on June 25, 2008, for July 10, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, an\namended notice of hearing was issued on June 27, 2008, moving the hearing by video-\nteleconference to July 2, 2008, in a neighboring European country. In requesting this\nchange, Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement.1\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted three\nexhibits (Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-3 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted six exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-F without objection. No witnesses were\ncalled. Applicant was given ten (10) days to submit any additional documents. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on July 14, 2008. On July 7, 2008, Government Counsel\nsubmitted a written response to my order for additional information concerning the\nsignificance of a U.S. citizen\u2019s registration in a foreign country under a European\npassport. On July 10, 2008, a document dated July 9, 2008, was emailed and accepted\ninto the record as Ex. G without objection. Department Counsel submitted a timely\nrebuttal on July 16, 2008. The record was closed on July 18, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is denied.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government submitted materials regarding the registration of American and\nEuropean citizens in Austria and in Poland. I requested such information to supplement\nthe record and assist in my evaluation of SOR allegation 1.b (You are currently\nregistered in Poland and Austria under your German passport). The proffered materials\nincluded foreign documents explaining the foreign national registration procedures in\nthose countries. I accept the five documents as Exs. 4-8 and grant the Government\u2019s\nmotion to take Administrative Notice of them. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 63-year-old manager who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor for approximately 26 years. During that time, she has held numerous\npositions within the U.S. Government, including the military. In 1977, she became a\nU.S. naturalized citizen based on her 1974 marriage to an American military officer. She\nalso received a U.S. passport in 1977, which she has since maintained and which is\ncurrently valid through 2018. During their marriage, they often went back and forth\nbetween the US. and Europe. The couple ultimately divorced in 1992. Applicant\ncontinued in her work abroad, although it was restricted to German assignments. Most\nof her travel was between Germany and the U.S. \nIn 1995, however, Applicant sought and obtained a German passport, based on\nher status as a German citizen. She obtained the German passport \u201cfor the\n\n  Tr. 31.\n    2\n  Tr. 32.\n    3\n  Tr. 33-35.\n    4\n  Tr. 34.\n    5\n  Tr. 75.\n    6\n  Tr. 49, 45.\n    7\n  Tr. 35-36.\n    8\n  Tr. 55.\n    9\n  Tr. 38.\n    10\n  Tr. 46-49.\n    11\n  Tr. 38.\n    12\n  Tr. 42.\n    13\n3\nconvenience and for the facilitation of\u201d her foreign work travel.  After it was received,\n2\nhowever, she was given assignments in Central and Eastern Europe.  Her German\n3\npassport was renewed in 2004 and is valid through 2014. By virtue of her German\npassport, she can take advantage of the open European borders created by the\nSchengen Agreements and the expedited European Union (E.U.) passport lines.  She\n4\nacknowledges that she can visit the same countries with her U.S. passport, but states:\n\u201cit\u2019s just much easier\u201d with the German passport.  \u201cI have a very heavy workload and I\n5\nam traveling all the time and sometimes I don\u2019t know where I was last week and\neverything that makes it easier for me would be certainly appreciated. . . .\u201d  Getting\n6\nVisas is often easier as a German with a German passport. She is registered in Austria\nand Poland under her German passport.  \n7\nApplicant does not vote in Germany, nor does she own property there. She\nreceives no benefits from Germany, except for the passport. She concedes she may be\neligible for some form of Social Security-like retirement for some employment held as a\nstudent and shortly before she moved to the U.S., but is not sure if under three years of\nemployment would qualify her for any Government payments.  Other than business\n8\ntrips or visits to her parents, she has no ties other ties to Germany except a small\nsavings account with a few hundred Euros.  The majority of her life is spent on the road\n9\nbetween business trips to various European cities. \u201c[I]t\u2019s kind of a unique situation and\nmay be hard for somebody from the outside to understand, but my job requires\ntraveling all the time.\u201d \n Her travel is extensive and almost constant.  Although she\n10\n11\nowns an apartment in Austria, she is only there about every third weekend or on\nstopovers between trips.  She is not an Austrian citizen, only a resident.\n12\n13\n\n  Ex. B (Letter of July 2, 2008); see also .Ex. G (Letter of July 9, 2008).\n    14\n  Tr. 77-78.\n    15\n  Ex. G (Letter of July 9, 2008). The undersigned lacks the authority to grant waivers or exceptions to DoD\n    16\npolicy.\n Id.\n    17\n  Id.\n    18\n  I take administrative notice of the solid relationship between the U.S. and Germany, and find Applicant\n    19\nis both loyal to the U.S. and a diligent employee. \n4\nDuring the hearing, Applicant expressed her intent to maintain her dual-\ncitizenship with Germany and to continue using her German passport to facilitate her\nwork travel within Europe. She also cited to European legal advice concerning her use\nof a German passport to facilitate her work permit in Poland.  Acknowledging\n14\nApplicant\u2019s heavy work travel, she was encouraged to discuss her continued use of a\nforeign passport in view of these proceedings with corporate counsel or her security\nofficer while the record was kept open for an additional 10 days.  Before the record\n15\nwas closed, Applicant submitted a letter in which she requested I \u201cconsider an\nexception to the DoD policy\u201d concerning her use of a German passport.  She stressed\n16\n\u201cI believe it remains without debate that the use of a European passport during my\nfrequent travels . . . significantly facilitates the [extensive] traveling. . . . Changing my\npassport now would require redoing my existing registrations. Also the ownership of my\napartment [in Austria] is based on my German passport.\u201d  She concludes by stating:\n17\n\u201cAt this time, I cannot fully evaluate the complexity of changing this and the problems\nthat could arise from switching all these registration to a US passport.\u201d  The remainder\n18\nof the document stresses the good relations between Germany, her loyalty to the U.S.,\nher integrity, and her many years of work in the defense industry.  \n19\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n  See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n    20\n  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    21\n  ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    22\n  Id.\n    23\n  Id.\n    24\n  Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    25\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n20\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n21\n22\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n23\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n24\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n25\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\n\n  AG \u00b6 9.\n    26\n  AG \u00b6 10(a). \n    27\n6\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following AG C \u2014 Foreign\nPreference to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\nset forth and discussed in the appropriate sections below.\nThe concern regarding foreign preference is that when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then she may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nU.S.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include\n26\nexercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  At the time the SOR was\n27\nissued, Applicant possessed a valid, current German passport, which she obtained or\nrenewed after becoming a U.S. citizen and which she has continued to use to facilitate\ntravel within Europe. This current and continued use is sufficient to give rise to Foreign\nPreference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) (possession of a current\nforeign passport). Similarly, her use of that passport to identify herself as a German\ncitizen in obtaining Visas, apartment ownership, work permits and registrations while\nentrusted with a U.S. security clearance gives rise to FP DC AG \u00b6 10(b) (action to\nacquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen). With such\ndisqualifying conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to explain or mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under this guideline.\nApplicant is correct that her dual citizenship with Germany, an important U.S.\nally, is based on her birth in that country. That fact initially raises Foreign Preference\nMitigating Condition (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country). Here, however, her dual citizenship goes\nbeyond her place of birth and extends to her retention and use of a German passport.\nMoreover, Applicant has not expressed a willingness to renounce her dual citizenship.\nAlthough such renunciation is not required, this fact makes FP MC AG \u00b6 11(b) (the\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) inapplicable. \nApplicant has reconstructed her professional life in Europe based on her\nGerman citizenship to the extent she has purchased a home base abroad, received\nforeign work permits, obtained Visas, and traveled as a citizen of a E.U country. The\nreason for these representations was purely a matter of expeditiousness and ease,\nbased primarily on foreign legal advice as to which passport would best facilitate\nvarious foreign processes without due consideration of the requirements expected of\nthose entrusted with protected U.S. information. Given the opportunity to consult\ncounsel and reconsider her continued active use of a foreign passport, Applicant chose\nto continue predicating her various foreign credentials on her German passport rather\n\n See, e.g., ISCR Case Number 06-25201 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2007).\n    28\n7\nthan transfer those credentials to her U.S. passport. The reason cited was\nconvenience. Although the possession of a U.S. security clearance does not preclude\ndual-citizenship or the existence of a foreign passport, per se, the representation that\none is a foreign national and the active use of a foreign passport in lieu of a U.S.\npassport poses genuine security concerns. Because she continues to actively use her\nGerman passport in such manner in lieu of her U.S. passport, FP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated) does not apply.28\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and this \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a highly credible, straight-forward, and pleasant\nwoman who is obviously devoted to her work and her profession. She is a mature\nwoman literally devoting her life to her job and finding fulfillment in her\naccomplishments. Her loyalty to this country is neither under attack nor an issue.\nBecause she is so diligent with her work, she has created a chaotic travel schedule\nwhich understandably makes her want to cut corners or make life easier where she can.\nConsequently, when told by foreign counsel some aspects of working abroad would be\nmore easily facilitated by using her German passport, she took the advice without\nconsideration of the guidelines pertaining to security clearances. Moreover, she\ncontinues to use her E.U. passport to facilitate travel within Europe.\nU.S. citizenship does not preclude such exercise of dual citizenship, per se.\nPossession of a U.S. security clearance, however, requires more than U.S. citizenship\nand loyalty. With it comes numerous other obligations and standards of conduct above\nthat expected from an average citizen, the majority of which involve matters of\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. While there is nothing about Applicant to\nsuspect she would be disloyal to the U.S. or its interests, possession of a security\n\n \u201cThe negative security significance of acts indicative of a foreign preference is not negated or diminished\n    29\nmerely because an applicant engages in those acts for personal reasons or for personal convenience. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0295 (Oct. 20, 2000) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 98-0252 (Sept. 15, 1999) at p. 8.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002), at 8.\n    30\n8\nclearance requires an unequivocal and demonstrable preference for the U.S. which\nApplicant\u2019s current work and travel practices do not reflect. Applicant, herself,\nacknowledges that she chose to predicate her apartment ownership, registrations, and\nother matters on her German passport in lieu of her U.S. passport. She also admits that\neven now her German passport can be substituted with her U.S. passport in all its\ncurrent applications, but she declines to make those changes as a matter of\ninconvenience. That is her choice. Convenience, however, is not a mitigating factor\nunder the guideline.  Consequently, foreign preference security concerns are not\n29\nmitigated. \nI considered all the facts of record and the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. I further note\nthat although there is no basis in the record to question Applicant\u2019s character or\nintegrity, the DOHA Appeal Board has determined that even good people can pose\nsecurity risks.  Based on these facts, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national\n30\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines D, M, and E \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 13, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received her response on May 16, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 5, 2008, and I received the case \nassignment on June 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 23, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for July 24, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government also offered a List of Government Exhibits \n(Ex) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were received \nwithout objection, and testified on her own behalf.

Her admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old data analyst, who has worked for her defense \ncontractor employer since February 2006. GE 1, Tr. 24, 27. She holds an interim secret \nclearance, and maintaining a clearance is a condition of her employment. Tr. 24-27. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2000.

She held at least two different jobs before accepting a position in \nJuly 2005 as a software trainer for a Government contractor. It was while she was \nemployed with this Government contractor that she was arrested for prostitution, \ndiscussed infra. GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 34-35, 57. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nIn conjunction with Applicant\u2019s background investigation for a security clearance, \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviewed Applicant in August 2007.1 The \nInvestigator conducting that interview wrote in his summary that Applicant volunteered \nafter arriving in major metropolitan area, she met men for sex through an internet dating \nsite an unrecalled number of times. GE 2. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) In her Response to SOR, \nApplicant stated: \n \nI admit that I have had sex with men that I have met through internet \ndating sites an unrecalled number of times. I deny that I only met them for \nthe purposes of having sex. Sex with men from dating sites was the result \nof a series of dates, and what I thought could potentially be a long term \nrelationship. I cannot recall the exact number of times this happened, but I \nwould estimate that it was less than 10 times. Internet dating is a viable \nway for many busy professionals to meet and date this day in age, and I \nbelieve that sex between two consulting adults, after a series of dates \ndoes not reflect a personality or mental disorder, nor does it affect my \nability to protect classified information. I do not believe this sexual \nbehavior serves as a basis of coercion, exploitation, or duress. I no longer \nassociate with any of these men, or participate with any of these dating \nsites.  \n \nThe Investigator wrote in his summary that Applicant stated she met other men \nfor sex through an instant messaging on the internet an unrecalled number of times. GE \n2.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) Applicant stated: \n \nI admit that I have met men whom I had sex with, through instant \nmessaging on the internet an unrecalled number of times. Again, the sex \nthat resulted from these instant messaging conversations came after a \nseries of dates, and I believed they could potentially lead to a long term \nrelationship. I do not recall the exact number of times this happened, but I \nwould estimate that it was less that 5 times. Again, I do not believe this \nbehavior reflects a personality or mental disorder, and does not reflect my \nability to protect classified information. I no longer associate with any of \nthese men, nor do I meet with people from the internet.  \n \nThe Investigator wrote in his summary that Applicant stated from about July \n20042 to November 2005 in MMA, she frequented nightclubs every weekend and would \nhave sex three to four times a month with the men she met there. (SOR 1.e.) Applicant \nstated: \n \n \n1 The August OPM Interview is a summary of interview prepared by the Investigator. On January \n4, 2008 in her Response to Written Interrogatories, Applicant indicated the summary of that Interview \ndoes not accurately reflect the information that she provided to the Investigator. GE 2.   \n \n2 The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s visits to nightclubs began in July 2003 versus July 2004, which is \nnot the date reflected in the summary of interview. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nI admit that I went to nightclubs frequently on the weekends here in [city \nname] from July 2004-November 2005 here in the [city name] area. I deny \nthat it was every weekend. I deny that it started in July 2003, as I was still \nin college in [home state] at that time. I admit that I would have sex with \nmen I met at these clubs 3-4 times a month. When I moved to the [city \nname] area in July of 2004, I came from a small town in [home state] to a \nLarge Metropolitan area like [city name]. I was intrigued by the nightlife in \nthis area, and having spent my 4 years in college working full time and \nworking on a double major, I had not been to bars or out to nightclubs \nbefore. The men that I met at these nightclubs and bars, and eventually \nhad sex with, were men that I thought I could potentially date, and lead to \na relationship. I was na\u00efve in my trust of those men, that they would not \ntake advantage of me. Again, I came from a very small town and did not \nhave much worldly experience, and perhaps got taken advantage of in \nsome ways, although I do take responsibility for my actions. I do not \nbelieve that my vulnerability and naivety as this age, and stage of my life \naffects my ability to protect classified information. I no longer visit any of \nthese night clubs, nor do I associate with any of the above referenced \nmen. I do not believe this sexual behavior serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \nAs noted supra, Applicant was previously employed as a software trainer by a \nGovernment contractor from July 2005 to December 2005. While employed by this \ncontractor, she held a security clearance. In November 2005, her then employer sent \nher on an off-site five-day temporary duty (TDY) assignment to a major metropolitan \narea to provide software training to federal law enforcement support personnel. Tr. 56-\n58, 76-77.  \n \nUpon arrival at her TDY site, using her company\u2019s laptop computer, she posted \nan ad on an open classified internet site advertising her desire to meet someone for the \npurpose of having sex for pay. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a.) GE 2, Tr, 35, 38-40. When asked \nwhy she placed an ad for sex for pay, she answered: \n \nHonestly, I can\u2019t give you an exact reason why I did that. I was \u2013 I guess I \nwas lonely, and I wanted to meet someone there. And I had seen other \nads on there asking for compensation for time or escorting, however you \nwant to put it. And I just made a bad decision.  \n \nAnd I mean at that point in my life, I really felt like sex was all I was worth \nanyway, and that\u2019s all anyone was interested in anyway. So I just made a \nbad decision. Tr. 46. \n \n \nSeveral people responded to Applicant\u2019s ad for sex; however, she only \nresponded to one individual because of his persistence. After discussing particulars \nthrough a series of e-mails and instant messages on her company computer, the \nindividual and Applicant agreed to meet at her hotel room on November 11, 2005 \nbetween 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. A man (undercover police officer) arrived at the \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nagreed time and place. Applicant and the man had a discussion about what was to \noccur and the price. After the man placed $400 on the table, he asked Applicant to get \nundressed while he made a telephone call. Shortly after the man made the telephone \ncall, four to six vice squad policemen accompanied by the hotel manager entered her \nroom. Applicant was placed under arrest for prostitution, taken into custody, and \ntransported to the city jail where she was processed and held overnight. On November \n12, 2005, she was arraigned and released on her own recognizance. Applicant was \nordered to appear for trial in municipal court on January 6, 2006. GE 2, Tr. 46-52. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b.) \n \n \nOn January 6, 2006, Applicant\u2019s attorney appeared on her behalf and entered a \nrequest for her acceptance into the Advanced Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) \nProgram. In February 2006, Applicant appeared in court and was accepted into the \nARD Program. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) She successfully completed the ARD Program and \nsubmitted a letter dated August 25, 2006 from her probation officer stating in part: \n \nYou have completed the ARD (Accelerated Rehabilitive Disposition) \nProgram. You have honored all of the Court Orders, and now your record \nwill be expunged. This expungement will take up to three months. \n \nRemember that your ARD Probation was not a conviction or an admission \nof guilt. Therefore, when applying for a job, do not state that you had a \nconviction. Please retain this letter for you records. AE I. \n \n \nIn addressing this allegation in her Response to SOR, Applicant stated: \n \nI admit that I placed an ad on [open classified internet site] in November of \n2005 for a meeting with someone with the intention of having sex. I admit \nthat I agreed to be paid for sex with the person in response to the ad. This \nwas a mistake and a huge lapse in my judgment, but in no way was or is, \nthis a pattern of behavior. I had never considered sex for money before \nthis, but saw other ads online where people were doing it, and made a \nhorrible decision. As soon as I placed the ad I began to regret it, and did \nnot answer any emails regarding it other than the officer\u2019s, due to his \npersistency. I told the officer no several times, but he was very persistent \nand eventually I agreed to meet him. I never thought I would end up \nhurting anyone by my actions. I have never done anything like that before, \nnor have or would I ever do anything similar in the future. I learned from \nmy mistake and have completely changed my life over the past 3 years. I \nam now a loving, faithful wife and mother to a baby girl, and blessed to be \npregnant with our second child.3  I do not believe that one momentary \nlapse in judgment should reflect my ability to protect classified information. \nEveryone in my life, including my husband, family, employer and friends \nknow what happened in [city name], so I do not believe the information \n \n3 At her hearing, Applicant stated she had a miscarriage shortly after she mailed in her Response \nto SOR. Tr. 28-29. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \ncould be used to coerce or exploit me. I feel I have taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nI admit that I was arrested in November 2005 [city name] and charged with \nprostitution. I admit that I was placed in an Accelerated Rehabilitative \nDisposition Program. I completed this program successfully and have \nsince been completely expunged of any criminal record. The decision to \nput me in this program was based on the fact that I have no criminal past \nor record of any kind.  \n \nUpon her return to work, Applicant immediately informed her employer about her \narrest. In December 2005, her employer advised her that allowing her to continue \nworking on their Government contract was too risky and offered her the opportunity to \nresign in lieu of being involuntarily terminated. Applicant claimed her employer told her \nshe would be eligible for rehire. Applicant resigned with her last day being December \n18, 2006. GE 2.  \n \n \nApplicant reiterated in her testimony that her behavior was a thing of the past and \nher arrest for prostitution was a real \u201cwake up\u201d call. Other than conferring with her family \nand friends, she has not sought any professional help in addressing her past behavior. \nTr. 86-88. \n \n \nApplicant submitted eight reference letters from various individuals to include \nemployer representatives, family members, and her baby sitter. All of the letters cast \nApplicant in a favorable light and speak of her as being trustworthy and possessing high \nintegrity, among other things. AE A \u2013 H. To further demonstrate her trustworthiness, \nApplicant submitted a copy of her contractor identification card expiring in September \n2007 that was issued to her during a two month TDY to a service academy. She claims \nher arrest and past conduct was vetted by the facility security officer (FSO) from the \nservice academy and the FSO \u201cgranted me full access to their facilities, as well as their \ninformation systems as he did not see me or my previous behaviors as a threat.\u201d AE J, \nTr. 19. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n  \n  \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 12, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nApplicant admitted the conduct alleged under this guideline, clarifying that she \ndid not go to nightclubs every weekend beginning as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. in July 2003, \nbut rather July 2004. She provided explanations for these allegations, which are \nprovided supra. Her admissions and evidence submitted by the Government \nsubstantiate the allegations under this concern. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 sets out four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nApplicant engaged in high risk sexual behavior for a documented period of 16 \nmonths from July 2004 to November 2005. This behavior consisted of meeting \nnumerous men through the internet and having brief sexual encounters with them. This \nconduct continued until Applicant was arrested for prostitution in November 2005. \nParticularly troubling is the fact that, while holding a security clearance, she engaged in \nconduct leading to this arrest after placing an ad for sex for pay on an open classified \ninternet site while using her company\u2019s laptop computer. She did not provide any \nevidence that she sought professional help or counseling regarding her past behavior. \nApplicant claims she has informed her family members and her employer and is not \nsubject to blackmail. It is difficult to glean from her reference letters to what extent the \nauthors of the letters are aware of Applicant\u2019s history. Her parents and brother use \nterms such as \u201ccompromising position\u201d and \u201cpast transgressions,\u201d but do not elaborate \non those terms. The facts of this case warrant application of AGs 13(a) through 13(c). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four potential mitigating conditions to the disqualify conditions \nsupra: \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 14(b) because there is no evidence \nthat any of the conduct alleged has occurred since her November 2005 arrest for \nprostitution. Applicant\u2019s conduct since her arrest appears exemplary, and she clearly \nhas the support of family members and employer representatives. However, given the \n16-month period Applicant engaged in high risk sexual behavior involving the internet, \nuse of an open classified internet site to advertise sex for pay, and the circumstances \nsurrounding her arrest while on company time to include the use of a company laptop \ncomputer while holding a security clearance, demonstrates a severe lack of judgment, \nwhich leaves me with remaining doubts about Applicant\u2019s present suitability to receive a \nsecurity clearance. Accordingly, I am unable to apply any of the other mitigating \nconditions under this concern and the partial credit Applicant received under AG \u00b6 14(b) \nis outweighed by the disqualifying conditions. \n \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) \n \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 39, the Government\u2019s concern is: \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \nAG \u00b6 40 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem. \n \n \nApplicant admitted she used her company\u2019s laptop computer to place an ad for \nsex for pay and coordinate the logistics for her sexual encounter while TDY. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \nOne mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 41 is potentially mitigating under this \ncondition: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \nI am unable to apply this mitigating condition given relative recency of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior and the serious nature of her conduct. She demonstrated a significant breach \nof the trust and confidence her company placed in her by using their laptop computer for \nillegal and improper purposes while holding a security clearance.  \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \nAlthough Applicant claims that her past history is well known by her employer, \nfamily members, etc., notably absent in her evidence is any direct reference by any of \nthe authors citing any specific knowledge of her arrest for prostitution and related \nbehavior. The process does not permit me to extrapolate such knowledge nor does it \nallow me to go beyond the evidence presented.  \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to this \ndisqualifying condition: \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and (e) for taking \nresponsibility for her actions and making positive life style changes. She has sought \nsupport through her family and friends, but has not sought professional help. A \nprofessional assessment indicating Applicant\u2019s behavior is no longer a concern would \nhave been helpful and as noted the process does not allow me to go beyond the \nevidence presented. \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and \nnot isolated. Considering her behavior, the nature and seriousness of her misconduct, \nher exercise of repeated poor judgment culminating in her arrest for prostitution, her \nmisuse of her company\u2019s laptop computer, and other factors identified supra, I find her \nfavorable information is not sufficient to mitigate Guideline D, M and E security \nconcerns. Her conduct raises questions about her ability and willingness to follow the \nlaw, and ultimately, to protect classified information. Her conduct also raises serious \ndoubts and questions about her judgment. Further time and additional evidence is \nneeded before I can overcome my concerns/doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s questionable \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the sexual behavior, use of informational technology systems, and personal \nconduct security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole person \nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable \ndecision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 38-year-old test manager employed with a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2006. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He is married and has two sons, ages 13 and 14. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 5, 30; Gov 1.) Applicant was born and raised in Iran. His older brothers immigrated to the U.S. in the mid 1970s to attend school. The plan was to arrange to have Applicant move to 3 the U.S. to live with his brothers. The Iranian revolution began in 1979. Initially, Applicant could not leave the country. The law was eventually changed and Applicant traveled to Austria and lived with his aunt. In Austria, he unsuccessfully attempted to apply for a U.S. visa. For two years, he lived and studied in France. His brother hired an immigration lawyer who assisted them in obtaining a VISA to the U.S. for Applicant. (Tr at 44-47.) In 1983, Applicant moved to the U.S. He received his U.S. permanent resident status (i.e. green card) in 1989. He lived with his older brother in a midwestern city, attending high school there. After he graduated from high school, he tried to enlist in the U.S. Air Force but was denied enlistment because he was not a U.S. citizen.

On January 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 14, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 25, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February \n27, 2008. The case was transferred to me on March 13, 2008. On March 14, 2008, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 3, 2008. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 4, which \nwere admitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative notice \nMay 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nbe taken of one document with 11 attachments. The document was marked as \nAdministrative Notice Document 1 (Admin Not 1) without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted two exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B \nwithout objection. The record was held open until April 17, 2008, to allow the Applicant \nto submit further documents. Applicant timely submitted a two-page document that was \nadmitted as AE C without objection. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on April \n11, 2008. The record closed on April 17, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIran is a theocratic Islamic republic. The United States has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since April 7, 1980. The U.S. Department of State has set forth \nconcerns of the United States with Iran\u2019s policies as: (1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (2) Iran\u2019s support for and involvement \nin international terrorism; (3) Iran\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East \npeace process; and (4) Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. (Admin Not 1, Doc 1 at 9) \nThe United States has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. (Admin Not 1, \nDoc 6 at 2.)  The government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses against the Iranian people \ninclude summary executions, lack of fair public trials, disappearances, torture, arbitrary \narrest and detention, political prisoners and detainees, severe restrictions on freedom of \nreligion, discrimination against women, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including \nspeech, press, assembly, association, movement and privacy. (Admin Not 1, Doc 5 at 1; \nDoc 4 at 8.)  \n \n The U.S. State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens and U.S.\u2013Iranian \ndual citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel to Iran. Some elements of the \nIranian regime remain hostile to the U.S. and U.S. citizens. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens \nmay be subject to harassment or arrest while residing in Iran. (Admin Not 1, Doc 3.) \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, and the children of such persons, are considered \nsolely Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. (Admin Not 1, Doc 2 at 1.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old test manager employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2006. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He is married and has two sons, ages 13 \nand 14. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 5, 30; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. His older brothers immigrated to the U.S. \nin the mid 1970s to attend school.  The plan was to arrange to have Applicant move to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe U.S. to live with his brothers. The Iranian revolution began in 1979. Initially, \nApplicant could not leave the country.  The law was eventually changed and Applicant \ntraveled to Austria and lived with his aunt. In Austria, he unsuccessfully attempted to \napply for a U.S. visa. For two years, he lived and studied in France. His brother hired an \nimmigration lawyer who assisted them in obtaining a VISA to the U.S. for Applicant. (Tr \nat 44-47.)  \n \nIn 1983, Applicant moved to the U.S. He received his U.S. permanent resident \nstatus (i.e. green card) in 1989. He lived with his older brother in a midwestern city, \nattending high school there. After he graduated from high school, he tried to enlist in the \nU.S. Air Force but was denied enlistment because he was not a U.S. citizen. He moved \nto New England and lived with an aunt and two cousins. He attended two years of \ncollege. He then moved in with his brother and transferred to another college.  In 1992, \nhe graduated with a degree in business administration. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1.)  \n \nAfter he graduated from college, Applicant went back to Iran because his father \nwas seriously ill. Applicant was subject to the Iranian military draft. When he returned to \nIran, he had three choices. He could join the Iranian Army. He could go to school, or he \ncould pay $16,700 to buy his military service requirement. He chose to attend school. \nHe could not return to the U.S. because the Iranian government would not allow him to \nleave. Applicant obtained a degree in business administration from an Iranian university. \nAfter he graduated, he could choose to enter the Iranian military or he could buy his \nmilitary service requirement. A change in the law reduced the price to $4,000 so \nApplicant bought his way out of his military service obligation.  He was then allowed to \nobtain an Iranian passport. He moved back to the United States within a few months in \nJuly 1999. (Tr at 56-58.) \n \n Applicant lived in Iran from 1992 to 1999. During this time, he met his wife. They \nmarried in 1992. Their two children were born in Iran. (Tr at 53-55.) When Applicant \nmoved back to the U.S. in 1999, his wife and children remained behind in Iran with \nfamily members. On May 15, 2003, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. When he returned \nto the U.S., he had to wait three years to apply for U.S. citizenship. (Tr at 55, 58-61; see \nGov 1, Certificate of Naturalization.) Once Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he took \naction to sponsor his wife and children into the U.S. (Tr at 61-62.)  \n \nIn 2003 and 2004, Applicant traveled to Iran to visit his family and to assist with \nhis family\u2019s immigration paperwork. He and his wife traveled from Iran to the United \nArab Emirates on several occasions in 2003 and 2004 in order to visit the U.S. \nEmbassy to process immigration forms. There was a problem with his wife\u2019s \nfingerprints. She was required to provide her fingerprints several times. In July 2004, his \nfamily moved to the U.S. Applicant claims that his children are U.S. citizens. His wife is \na permanent resident of the U.S. and is in the process of applying for U.S. citizenship. \n(Tr at 13-15, 40, 68, 101.) \n \nApplicant possesses a valid Iranian passport.  It was issued on September 20, \n1998 and had an expiration date of September 20, 2003.  On September 10, 2003, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant arranged to have his Iranian passport extended to September 19, 2008. \nApplicant also has a U.S. passport that was issued on May 19, 2003, with an expiration \ndate of May 18, 2013.  Applicant traveled to Iran on his Iranian passport because he \nbelieved it to be safer and convenient. After the hearing, he turned his Iranian passport \ninto his Facility Security Officer (FSO). (Tr at 38-39, 65-66; AE C.) He does not intend to \nrenew his Iranian passport and never intends to travel to Iran ever again. His home is in \nthe U.S. (Tr at 35, 37.) \n \nIn response to Section 9, Where You Have Lived, on Applicant\u2019s e-QIP \napplication, which asks \u201cProvide a detailed entry for each place you have lived in the \nlast 7 years. All periods must be accounted for in your list. Do not list a permanent \naddress when you were actually living at a school address, etc. You may omit \ntemporary military duty locations under 90 days (list your permanent address instead).\u201d \nApplicant listed the places he lived over the past 27 years which was more than the 7 \nyear time frame required by the question. In the fourth entry, he listed a U.S. address \n(his brother\u2019s address) for the time period between August 1998 to August 2000. In the \nfifth entry, Applicant listed a U.S. address (his brother\u2019s address) for the time period \nbetween January 1990 and August 1998.  The U.S. address is not accurate because \nApplicant resided in Iran between 1992\u20131999. Applicant could not explain why he listed \na U.S. address during a time period when he was living in Iran.  (Tr at 62-64; Gov 1.) \n \n  Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2000.  He did not travel to Iran for his father\u2019s \nfuneral. (Tr at 74-79.) His mother is a naturalized citizen living in the U.S.  His \ngrandmother is a citizen of and resides in Iran. In a signed, sworn statement dated \nMarch 23, 2007, he indicated he telephones his grandmother once a week. (Tr at 71; \nGov 2.) He has two brothers and one nephew who are naturalized citizens residing in \nthe U.S. On his mother\u2019s side of the family, he has three aunts and one uncle who are \ncitizens of and reside in Iran.  His last contact with his aunts and uncles was 2004 when \nhe traveled to Iran.  The last contact that he had with his father\u2019s relatives was 1997-\n1998. (Tr at 75, 78.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law passed away in 2006-2007.  His wife traveled to Iran \non one occasion prior to her death to care for her and traveled to Iran to attend her \nfuneral. Applicant stayed home with the children. (Tr at 78, 84.) Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nlives in Iran but obtained permanent resident status in the U.S. this past year. He stayed \nwith Applicant and his family over the past month. Currently, he is visiting his son in \nFlorida before he travels back to Iran. He lives part of the year in Iran. He is a retired oil \nexecutive. He had a high level position as the second or third person in charge of a \nrefinery. (Tr at 80-81; Gov 2.) Applicant\u2019s wife is close to her father. (Tr at 102.) \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brother-in-laws are citizens of and reside in Iran.  One is an \naccountant. The other does administrative work.  His wife speaks with her brothers on \nthe phone at least once a month.  About three to four times a year, Applicant talks with \nhis brothers-in-law when they call his wife. (Tr at 102-103; Gov 2.)   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant inherited an interest in an apartment in Iran from his father. His mother \nhas power of attorney and handles all business related to it. He never receives anything \nfrom it. He owns his home, and his investments are in the United States. He has no \noverseas investments. (Tr at 85-89.)   \n \nA process manager at Applicant\u2019s company testified on his behalf. She has \nworked with Applicant over the past three years. He used to work for her. They now \nwork on projects together from time to time. She states that Applicant is thorough and \ndetail oriented. She holds him in high regard and finds him trustworthy. During a six \nmonth period when she was working at the company\u2019s overseas office, Applicant was \nplaced in charge and kept her informed while she was gone.  A co-worker testified that \nhe met Applicant nine years ago at a former place of employment. They have been \nfriends since. They currently work together on a daily basis. Applicant became his \nmanager in July 2007. He states Applicant is an excellent manager. He trusts him like \nhe would trust a member of his family.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s former manager from a previous job testified that he has known \nApplicant since 2002. They developed a strong friendship and deep mutual respect for \none another. He describes Applicant as honest and considers himself truly blessed to \ncome to this country. He believes he will do whatever is in the best interest of the \ncountry. (AE A.)  \n \nA performance evaluation covering the periods of February 2007 to February \n2008 indicates that Applicant\u2019s overall performance rating as \u201cexceeds requirements.\u201d \nHe is described as \u201cextremely reliable and trustworthy\u201d Further comments state, \u201cHe \nsets the performance bar high for himself and leads by example. He has gone above \nand beyond the call of duty numerous times. He is a great asset to the organization and \nto his team members.\u201d (AE B.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant has a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nvalid Iranian passport. He obtained the passport on September 20, 1993, prior to his \nU.S. citizenship. However, he applied for an extension of his Iranian passport on \nSeptember 10, 2003, after having become a U.S. citizen. His Iranian passport does not \nexpire until September 19, 2008. He used the Iranian passport when he traveled to Iran.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) does not apply. While Applicant obtained his dual citizenship based \non his birth in Iran, he exercised his dual citizenship by applying for and using a Iranian  \npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen in May 2003. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies.  After the hearing, Applicant \nprovided proof that he surrendered his Iranian passport to his Facility Security Officer. \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) applies. He has no intention to renew his Iranian passport when it \nexpires in September 2008.   \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns. Guideline C is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies as a result of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Iran.  His grandmother and two \nbrother-in-laws are citizens of and reside in Iran. His father-in-law resides in Iran for part \nof the year.  Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that \ninformation) applies for the same reason.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an \napplicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse\u2019s immediate family \nmembers. (ISCR Case No. 02-03120, February 20, 2002, at 4.)  \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) & 7(d) (sharing living quarter \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant\u2019s wife continues to have close contacts with her \nbrothers and father who reside in Iran. Her contact with her relatives raise the potential \nto create a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.   \n \nThough not alleged in the SOR, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI \nDC) & 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or \nin any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence of exploitation) was potentially raised due to \nApplicant\u2019s ownership interest in an apartment he inherited from his father. Applicant\u2019s \nmother handles all of the affairs pertaining to renting out the apartment and receives the \nmoney in return. I find that FI DC \u00b6 7(e) is not applicable pertaining to Applicant\u2019s \ninterest in the apartment because he receives minimal, if any, benefit from it. All of his \nother assets are in the United States.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. \n \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the \nrelationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the \nposition or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) \nFamily contacts and ties with persons in a foreign country are not automatically \ndisqualifying but require the applicant to present evidence in mitigation and extenuation \nthat he qualifies for a security clearance. Iran\u2019s hostile relationship with the United \nStates and the country\u2019s poor human rights record place \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion \non applicant to show his family members do not pose a security risk. (See, ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006).  Applicant has not met that burden. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties in Iran are significant enough to raise foreign influence concerns. \nThe risk is heightened due to the nature of the Iranian government.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \n\n \n9 \n \n \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  In order for FI MC \u00b6 8(b) to apply, Applicant must meet at \nleast one of the conditions outlined. The first condition is that there is no conflict of \ninterest because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person(s) is \nminimal. This condition is not met because Applicant\u2019s relationship with his grandmother \nwho lives in Iran cannot be considered minimal. He contacts her once a month. His \nrelationship with his in-laws residing in Iran cannot be considered minimal. His father-in-\nlaw recently visited them for about a month. He is returning to Iran soon. Applicant \ncontacts his father-in-law at least once a month when he resides in Iran. His wife \ncontacts her brothers who live in Iran once a month. Applicant occasionally speaks with \nthem as well.    \n \nThe second condition of FI MC \u00b6 8(b) is that individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.  Applicant first came to the U.S. in \n1983. He attended high school and college in the U.S. However, he moved back to Iran \nin 1992 and lived there for six years. While it appears that the Iranian government \nprevented him from returning to the U.S. by confiscating his passport, he did not \ndisclose his residence in Iran on his e-QIP application. He gave his brother\u2019s U.S. \naddress instead. This raises concerns about his credibility and whether he was \nattempting to hide the full extent of his contact in Iran.  Although his wife and two \nchildren reside with him in the U.S., FI MC \u00b6 8(b) cannot be applied.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members and in-\nlaws who live and reside in Iran cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.f.  This SOR paragraph alleges that \nApplicant traveled to the United Arab Emirates in 2003 and 2004 to complete his \nspouse\u2019s immigration documents to the U.S.  As mentioned in the allegation, the \npurpose of travel to the United Arab Emirates was to process his wife\u2019s U.S. immigration \ndocuments.  Since the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, there is no \nU.S. embassy located in Iran.  There is no foreign influence concern raised by this \nallegation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has received numerous \naccolades from friends and co-workers pertaining to his integrity, honesty and work \nethic. While the favorable testimony and strong letters of support state that Applicant is \na man of integrity and loyalty, they do not reduce the very significant security threat \nposed by Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran. The government need not prove an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. \nEven good people can pose a security risk because of facts and circumstances not \nunder their control. An applicant with good character and personal integrity can pose a \nsecurity risk because the applicant has close relatives in a country that is hostile to the \nUnited States. (ISCR 01-26893, dated October 16, 2002, at 9-10.) A further concern is \nraised due to Applicant\u2019s inability to explain why he listed a U.S. address on his security \napplication during a time when he was living in Iran.   \n \nGuideline B is a security concern that affects Applicants through no fault of their \nown. The current nature of the Iranian government and the hostile relationship between \nIran and the U.S. make it a substantial burden to mitigate the concerns raised under \nforeign influence.  Applicant\u2019s significant personal relationships and contacts within the \nU.S. do not outweigh the concerns raised by having relatives who are citizens and \nreside in Iran. Foreign Influence security concerns are not mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is an information analyst who has worked for the same defense contractor for approximately two years. He turned 25-years-old shortly before the hearing. He received his high school diploma in June 2002 and earned a bachelor of science degree in information technology in 2006. He is single and has no children. At issue are three security clearance applications completed by Applicant: a SF-86 dated on November 7, 2002, a second SF-86 dated on June 5, 2006, and an e-QIP dated April 12, 2007. In each of his applications, Applicant denied having used illegal drugs since the age of 16 or within the past seven years. 2 In the autumn of 2002, Applicant enrolled in college. There, he entered the Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) program to investigate the option of a future military career. As part of the program, he was required to complete a significant amount of paperwork, including what he later understood to be a paper SF-86.

On April 15, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response received on May 14, 2008, Applicant admitted two of the four\nallegations raised under Guideline E and denied all allegations raised under Guidelines\nH and J.

Department Counsel and Applicant proposed a\nJuly 22,  2008, hearing, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 1, 2008.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits\n(Exs.) which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted four exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-D without objection.  No witnesses were\n1\ncalled. Applicant was given until August 6, 2008, to submit any further materials. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on July 30, 2008. Department Counsel received and\nreviewed four additional submissions from Applicant on August 6, 2008. Department\nCounsel forwarded the package, noting her lack of objection to any of its contents. That\npackage was received on August 8, 2008, and accepted into the record as Exs. E-H.\nThe record was then closed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and\ntestimony, security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is an information analyst who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor for approximately two years. He turned 25-years-old shortly before the\nhearing. He received his high school diploma in June 2002 and earned a bachelor of\nscience degree in information technology in 2006. He is single and has no children.  At\nissue are three security clearance applications completed by Applicant: a SF-86 dated\non November 7, 2002, a second SF-86 dated on June 5, 2006, and an e-QIP dated\nApril 12, 2007. In each of his applications, Applicant denied having used illegal drugs\nsince the age of 16 or within the past seven years.  \n2\nIn the autumn of 2002, Applicant enrolled in college. There, he entered the\nReserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) program to investigate the option of a future\nmilitary career. As part of the program, he was required to complete a significant\namount of paperwork, including what he later understood to be a paper SF-86. That\nform was later reformatted and submitted by the ROTC program on or about November\n11, 2002.  Applicant passed a required drug test and completed one semester in the\n3\nprogram.  He then dropped out of ROTC. He would not learn that a security clearance\n4\nwas granted in December 2002 until 2006.5\n\n In signed Responses to Interrogatories, dated Feb. 5, 2008, (Ex. 4) Applicant stated he started using\n6\nmarijuana during high school while elsewhere he stated he started using it in the summer of 2002. Applicant\nmaintains, however, that he meant the year 2003, while he was in college. His credible testimony dispels\nconcerns that inconsistency implies falsity.\n Tr. 27.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Tr. 26.\n9\n Interrogatories, dated Feb. 5, 2008, at 2.\n10\n Tr. 25.\n11\n Tr. 25-26.\n12\n Tr. 26.\n13\n Id.\n14\n3\nDuring the spring of 2003, Applicant illegally used marijuana with a high school\nfriend.  This started a pattern of monthly marijuana use that would continue for about\n6\nthree years. He used marijuana socially about once or twice a month during this time.  \n7\nDuring his senior year, from March 2006 through May 2006, Applicant had an\ninternship with a defense contractor. In June 2006, he completed a SF-86. He denied\nrecent and past drug use: \u201cI was stupid. I was in college, I probably didn\u2019t take it as\nseriously as I should. . . . I have no defense for that. It was basically an immature and\nstupid decision.\u201d  He did not initially realize that this form was a form equivalent to one\n8\nhe completed for the ROTC program a few years earlier. In completing the form,\nhowever, he read that using marijuana while holding a security clearance was a felony.\nAs a consequence, he quit using marijuana shortly thereafter.  This decision was an\n9\nattempt to demonstrate compliance with the law, as well as an attempt to act as a\nmature, responsible adult.10\nApplicant graduated from college in December 2006. After finding his current\nposition in March 2007, he completed an e-QIP in April 2007. On that application, he\nagain denied having used marijuana since age 16 or within the past seven years. He\ndid this because he was afraid that changing his answer and admitting past drug use\nwould jeopardize his job.  During a July 2007 interview with investigators, however,\n11\nApplicant volunteered the correct information regarding his past drug use: \u201cI came\nclean. It was on my own free will. . . . I had been out of college for about six months and\nI had begun to recognize the responsibility, not just with the security clearance, but as a\nmember of society. . . . I needed to tell the truth\u201d  In openly disclosing the true facts,\n12\nwhich had thus far not been uncovered despite prior investigation, Applicant knew he\nrisked losing his security clearance.  Despite that risk, he \u201cstill chose to come forward\n13\nand to tell the truth.\u201d  \n14\n\n Ex.F (Promotion letter, emailed Jul. 21, 2008).\n15\n Ex. G (W aiver letter, signed Aug. 6, 2008).\n16\n Tr. 37.\n17\n Tr. 39.\n18\n4\nApplicant has proven to be an excellent and reliable employee. His work records\nshow outstanding performance and superior growth. He was promoted to the next\nprofessional level within 16 months of his hiring, based on his technical performance\nand commitment to meeting customer network security requirements.  His employer is\n15\naware of Applicant\u2019s appeal and assisted him in preparing a document stating that 1)\nApplicant is aware of Department of Defense drug policies and 2) Applicant would\nwaive his right to appeal if he is caught or suspected of using illegal drugs in the\nfuture.  Applicant successfully passed a drug screening when he was first hired in\n16\n2007.  \n17\nApplicant has actively and earnestly attempted to demonstrate a growing level of\nmaturity since leaving school and joining the workforce. He is genuinely embarrassed\nand contrite over his past drug use and misrepresentations. He is committed to not\nusing illegal drugs again in the future. He no longer associates with those using illegal\ndrugs. He notes that his collegiate peers with whom he maintains contact and who also\nused drugs at school have similarly matured and become drug-free.  Applicant fully\n18\nappreciates the importance of candor in this process, an appreciation which motivated\nhim to correct his 2007 SF-86 answer regarding past drug use. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n19\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n20\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n21\n Id.\n22\n Id.\n23\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n5\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n19\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n20\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n21\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n22\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n23\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n24\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse\nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions\nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants,\nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug\nabuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction. \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  \nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, examination is made of an Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information based on his past personal\nconduct and actions. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. On more than one occasion, Applicant deliberately denied\nusing illegal drugs since the age of 16 or within seven years preceding his application\nfor a security clearance. Consequently, Personal Conduct (PC) Disqualifying Condition\n(DC), AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies.\nWhen Applicant denied past drug use on his April 2007 security clearance\napplication, he did so in order to make his answers consistent with those he provided\nwhile still in college. Having matured considerably since finishing school, he regretted\n\n7\nthis decision and wanted to set the record straight regardless of the repercussions. In\nJuly 2007, on his own initiative, Applicant disclosed the truth about his past drug at his\nfirst meeting with investigators. But for this disclosure, the truth may never have come\nto light. The Appeal Board, however, has repeatedly determined that such a protracted\nperiod of time is insufficient to be deemed \u201cprompt\u201d under PC Mitigating Condition (MC)\n1, AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual has made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). \nApplicant concedes that he first failed to disclose his past drug use because he\nwas immature, then felt trapped into not varying from his prior answers. He described\nhis decisions to conceal the truth as \u201cstupid.\u201d Therefore, PC MC 2, AG \u00b6 17(b) (the\nrefusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal\ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security\nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide\nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully) does not apply.\nUsing marijuana and giving false information during an investigation are criminal\nacts. Applicant used marijuana on a monthly basis during a three year period in college.\nHe concealed his drug use more than once. Applicant admits his drug use and his\nmisrepresentations were immature and ill advised. Therefore, PC MC 3, AG \u00b6 12(c) (the\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nTo his credit, Applicant matured considerably between 2006 and 2007. Although\nhe kept it secret, he took the initiative to quit using drugs, change his lifestyle, and focus\non a career. Feeling compelled to perpetuate his \u201cstupid\u201d lie about past drug use, he\nagain denied it in 2007. Maturity and adult integrity, however, won out. This was\ndemonstrated when he chose to tell the truth and correct the record despite any\nadverse professional repercussions. Further, since taking that corrective action, he has\nmoved on and proven himself to be a reliable, valued professional who has learned a\nvaluable lesson. Consequently, PC MC 4, AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\nsteps \nto \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthiness, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur), PC MC 5, AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress), and PC MC 7,\nAG \u00b6 17(g) (association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs\nunder circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations) apply.\nNo other mitigating conditions apply.\nThe amended adjudicative guidelines provide slightly more leniency than their\npredecessors. Applicant\u2019s correction as to his false answers was not sufficiently prompt\nto invoke AG \u00b6 17(a), It does, however, seem sufficient under the facts and\ncircumstances unique to this Applicant to demonstrate his mature and earnest attempt\n\n Because Applicant readily admits he bought the marijuana he used, specific discussion as to the unique\n25\nfacts involved in how he solicited such purchases is reserved for Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\n8\nto rectify his immature, collegiate actions. He did so after weighing his recognition of\ndoing the right thing versus jeopardizing his career and his eligibility for a security\nclearance. Today, he is drug-free, performs reliably at work, and comports his behavior\nwith that expected of a 25-year-old professional adult.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nApplicant used marijuana once or twice a month for three years in college.\nConsequently, Drug Involvement (DI) Disqualifying Condition (DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug\nabuse) applies.  With a disqualifying condition thus established, the burden shifts to\n25\nApplicant to mitigate security concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s collegiate use of marijuana, while illegal, is far from unique. As his\ngraduation day approached, he recognized that it was time to comport his behavior with\nthat expected within the professional milieu to which he aspired. This included\ndiscontinuing his occasional use of marijuana, a use he learned in 2006 was proscribed\nfor those holding a security clearance. He has now been drug-free for two and a half\nyears, a not insignificant amount of time considering the few years he abused the drug\nand given his relative youth. In disclosing the truth regarding his past drug use,\nApplicant demonstrated personal growth, maturity, and candor. It also demonstrated a\nclear understanding and acknowledgment that drug abuse is illegal and incompatible\nwith the possession of a security clearance. Given the adult honesty and responsibility\ndemonstrated, in conjunction with his resolve never to again use drugs, DI Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 1, AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nApplicant ceased using marijuana two and a half years ago, a not insignificant\namount of time given the fact he recently turned 25. He has repeatedly declared his\nintent not to use drugs in the future. He no longer associates with those who use drugs\nor moves within an environment that accepts them. With the aid of his security officer,\nApplicant has signed a statement noting that he is aware of Department of Defense\ndrug policies and that he will waive his right to appeal if he is caught or suspected of\nusing illegal drugs in the future. DI MC 2, AG \u00b6 26(b) (a documented intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation) applies. None of the remaining mitigating\nconditions apply. \nIn resolutely quitting his use of marijuana, trading in his collegiate lifestyle for that\nof a professional, and coming clean with investigators, Applicant demonstrated that he\nhas matured. As the result of his maturation, he demonstrated his ability and\n\n9\nwillingness to comply with the rules and adult judgment. Such a showing directly\naddresses this guidelines concerns.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established\nits case. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1001, it is a crime to knowingly and willfully make any\nmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within\nthe jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the United States.\nApplicant admits he answered questions regarding present and past drug use\nincorrectly. Such conduct and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns,\ninvoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1, AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, AG \u00b631(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted, or convicted), and initiate inquiry.\nApplicant provided incorrect answers on two security clearance applications, one\nin 2006 and one in 2007. The only unique aspect of these two instances is the fact\nApplicant felt under pressure to keep his 2007 answers consistent with those he gave in\n2006. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Moreover, the\ntype of pressure experienced by Applicant to keep his answers consistent was not he\ntype contemplated in CC MC 2, AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into\ncommitting the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life), so it\ndoes not apply.\nBecause Applicant admits his actions, CC MC 3, AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the\nperson did not commit the offense) does not apply. However, Applicant did come\nforward to correct the record at the first opportunity he had to meet with investigative\npersonnel after submitting his 2007 questionnaire. He did so maturely and with full\nknowledge that disclosing the truth could jeopardize his obtaining a security clearance.\nThis action is consistent with the personal growth and maturation Applicant has\nexperienced as he has aged and entered the professional working world. There, he\nexcels in his work and has merited promotion based on his skills and reliability. Despite\nthis concerns raised through this process, he maintains the support and working rapport\nwith his employer and security officer. Such factors raise CC MC 4, AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) and\nhighlight how his past acts of concealment were the result of an immaturity since\nreplaced by maturity and a desire to set the record straight no matter the potential cost.\n\n10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a college graduate who socially used marijuana for\nthree years at school. Recently turning 25-years-old, he quit using marijuana before\ngraduation as he prepared to transition from a sheltered college life to the working\nworld. He has since focused on leading a responsible, professional lifestyle. While\nundergoing this transition, however, he falsely denied using marijuana shortly before he\nquit using it. Once the answer was given, he initially felt compelled to stick to the lie.\nUltimately, and with full knowledge that setting the record straight could jeopardize his\napplication and his career, he disclosed the truth and took all responsibility for his\nearlier, immature actions. \nApplicant\u2019s initial conduct was clearly the result of ill judgment and it\ndemonstrated unreliability. Given that his silence may well have left his secret\nundisclosed, his remedial disclosure and subsequent performance at work demonstrate\nhis maturation and rehabilitation. They also demonstrate the type of candor and\nhonesty expected of one holding a security clearance. While more time to demonstrate\nmaturity is often required in such cases, Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and demeanor\ncontain sufficient evidence that he has matured and is not likely to repeat any related\nconduct. Additional time and additional anecdotes would merely be cumulative.\nApplicant has adequately mitigated personal conduct, drug involvement, and criminal\nconduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief is challenging the hiring policy of private companies, the Board is in no\n1\nposition to comment.  Our authority is defined by the Directive and does not extent to such matters.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that it was unfair of the Judge to deny him a clearance just because he was\noriginally from Iraq and had family members living in that country and in-laws living in Syria.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether an applicant personally believes the Judge was\nunfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead\na reasonable person to question her fairness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings\nor reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,\n2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,\nstanding alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of persuasion, in\nthat he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable\nperson to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).1\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven circumstances\nunder any of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-\n22643 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-18218 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2005).  DOHA has adjudicated foreign preference\ncases involving applicants associated with or having family ties to a wide variety of countries.\nForeign ties such as the ones maintained by Applicant are of legitimate concern to the Department\nin assessing risks to the nation\u2019s security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n27, 2003).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\n\nSOR paragraph 1(c).\n2\nseriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR factual allegations.2\nHowever, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B.  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under\nGuideline B is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP). On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B, \nForeign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 21, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On August 13, 2008, the case was assigned to   \nme. I convened a hearing on September 30, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nNovember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses, introduced three exhibits (Ex.), offered \nfacts in five official documents of the U.S. Government for administrative notice \nregarding Iraq, and facts in nine official documents of the U.S. Government for \nadministrative notice regarding Syria. The Government\u2019s exhibits were identified as Ex. \n1, 2, and 3, and they were admitted to the record without objection. Applicant did not \nobject to my taking notice of facts provided in the Government\u2019s administrative notice \ndocuments. The Government\u2019s administrative notice documents were identified as HE \n1.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two witnesses, introduced four exhibits \n(Ex. A, B, C, and D), and offered facts from three official documents of the U.S. \nGovernment for administrative notice. He also offered a factual definition from a non-\ngovernmental source for administrative notice. The Government did not object to my \ntaking administrative notice of facts offered by Applicant. Applicant\u2019s administrative \nnotice documents were identified as HE A.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business \nOctober 7, 2008, so that the Government and Applicant could submit additional \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s security clearance status. The Government \nsubmitted a memorandum on the subject, which I identified as Ex. 4 and admitted to the \nrecord without objection. Applicant also timely submitted one additional document on \nthe subject, which I identified as Applicant\u2019s Ex. E and entered in the record without \nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 7, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations that raise security concerns under adjudicative \nguideline (AG) B, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e). In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted all allegations under adjudicative guideline B. His admissions \nare admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guideline, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old, married, and the father of two minor children.  He was \nborn in Iraq and is an ethnic Kurd.  He seeks a security clearance so that he may be \nemployed by a government contractor as a translator.  He is fluent in Arabic, Farsi, and \ntwo Kurdish dialects. (Ex. 1; Tr. 42-45, 93-94.)  \n \n \nIn 1973 and 1974, Applicant was a member of a Kurdish political organization. \nHe joined the party in order to be eligible for a job. He had a 12th grade education.  \nSubsequently, he was employed by a local government to teach Arabic and \nmathematics to fourth and fifth grade students in the Kurdish area of Iraq. In 1974, when \nKurds were being persecuted, he left Iraq and went to live as a refugee in Iran.  He \nresided in a refugee camp and, for about two years, studied to be a social worker and \ntook part in a program in the camp for the training of translators. Sometime during 1975 \nand 1976, Applicant\u2019s mother, who lived in Iraq, was detained by Iraqi authorities who \n\n \n3 \n \n \nintended to use her to pressure Applicant to return to Iraq. In 1976, believing the \nIranians were not doing enough to help the Kurds, and unable to return to Iraq for fear \nof being put to death by the Iraqi authorities, Applicant emigrated from Iran to the United \nStates. He became a U.S. citizen in 1982.   (Ex. 2 at 3-4, 8-9; Tr. 74-79, 100.)  \n \n \nApplicant attended vocational school in the United States and learned auto \nmechanics.  He worked for approximately 25 years as an automobile mechanic. (Tr. 47-\n49.) \n \n \nIn 1988, Applicant and a friend, also an ethnic Kurd, traveled to the Kurdish part \nof Syria. They met and married Syrian women of Kurdish background. The women were \nsisters.  When it came time for Applicant and his friend to leave Syria and return to the \nUnited States, they were detained and questioned by Syrian secret police, who wanted \nto know their purpose in visiting Syria.  After questioning Applicant and his friend for one \nweek, the Syrian secret police permitted them to leave Syria.  (Ex. 2 at  8; Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a U.S. citizen in 1992. She is employed by a U.S. \ngovernment agency but does not have a security clearance. Her father and mother are \ncitizens and residents of Syria. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is approximately 80 years old. \nHe owns farm land, rents it to tenants, and shares the profits with them. Applicant\u2019s wife \nsponsored her parents for permanent registered alien status. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nhas a U.S. Social Security card. From 2000 to about 2003 or 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nparents visited Applicant and his wife yearly and resided in Applicant\u2019s home when they \nvisited them.  Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her parents by telephone, but Applicant does \nnot know how often she communicates with her parents. He thinks his wife might speak \nwith her parents about every two months. Applicant\u2019s in-laws complain of poor treatment \nby the government of Syria. Applicant\u2019s wife has a brother and a sister who are also \ncitizens and residents of Syria. The Syrian government persecuted the husband of one \nof Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sisters. Consequently, he moved to Sweden. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2 at 6, 19; \nEx. 4; Ex. E; Tr. 83-90, 106-108, 114, 116.) \n \n \nApplicant has one sister and eight brothers who are residents and citizens of \nIraq.  Most of Applicant\u2019s siblings were little children when he left Iraq in 1974. All live in \nthe north of Iraq.  Applicant does not communicate regularly with his siblings because \nmany of them have no stable work and want his financial help. He cannot afford to help \nthem. Recently, one of Applicant\u2019s brothers contacted him and asked for money.  \nApplicant arranged for the brother to receive less than $300. (Tr. 58-59, 64, 120-121.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a full-time housewife and mother. She is not employed \noutside her home. Since 2005, one of Applicant\u2019s brothers has worked as a driver for a \nmilitary entity in Iraq; another brother is a taxi driver; and a third brother has a small \nvegetable produce shop.  Applicant\u2019s fourth brother is a barber; his fifth brother is a \nmason; and a sixth brother is a day laborer.  Applicant\u2019s seventh brother is a school \ncustodian.  His eighth brother is a physician\u2019s assistant.  (Tr. 65-69.) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nAfter the fall of Saddam Hussein, one of Applicant\u2019s brothers received an \nanonymous note threatening him with death unless he moved to another part of Iraq. He \ntook the threat seriously and moved. (Tr. 119-120) \n \n \nSince emigrating from Iraq to the United States, Applicant has returned to Iraq \ntwice, once in 1992 and once in 2005, during the Iraq war.  He traveled with his young \nson to Iraq in 2005 to visit his mother who was ill and who died shortly after his return to \nthe United States.  (Tr. 60-61.)   \n \n \n \nAfter working as an automotive mechanic for many years, Applicant suffered a \nheart attack in July 2006 and had three stents placed in his heart.  He decided he could \nno longer do heavy work and sought a job as a translator. After completing his \napplication and taking tests, Applicant was informed he could not be deployed as a \ntranslator to a war zone because he was taking a prescribed blood thinner. Since that \ntime, Applicant has been unemployed and on disability.  His wife supports the family \nand holds three jobs.  One of her jobs is with a federal agency. Applicant confirmed that \nhe is being sponsored for a job as a translator by a government contractor, pending a \ndecision on his eligibility for a security clearance. (Tr. 50-53, 100-102.) \n \n \nIn his testimony Applicant sometimes rambled and I found it difficult to follow his \nexplanations. (Tr. 42-44, 47-48, 53-54, 58, 75,79, 93.) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iraq: \n \n \n\u201cIn 2003 a U.S.-led coalition removed Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime \nfrom power.  In March 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office after being freely elected \nby the Iraqi people.  However, violence continues to engulf the country.  This violence \nhas been fueled and perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and Shiite \nmilitias and death squads.\u201d  (HE 1: Iraq: Summary at 1.) \n \n \n\u201cThe State Department has specifically stated that: \u2018[t]he risk of terrorism directed \nagainst U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remains extremely high.\u2019  Furthermore, the \nState Department has posted the following warning: \n \nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue, \nincluding in the International (or \u2018Green\u2019) Zone.  Targets include hotels, \nrestaurants, police stations, checkpoints, foreign diplomatic missions, and \ninternational organizations and other locations with expatriate personnel.  \nSuch attacks can occur at any time.  Kidnappings still occur; the most \nrecent kidnapping of an American citizen occurred in August 2007.\u201d \n  \n(HE 1: Iraq: Summary at 2.) \n \n \n\u201cFurthermore, there are U.S.-substantiated reports of human rights abuses, \nincluding a \u2018pervasive climate of violence, misappropriation of official authority by \nsectarian, criminal and insurgent groups; arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, \n\n \n5 \n \n \ntorture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u2019 \u201d (HE 1: Iraq: \nSummary at 2.)  \n \n \n\u201cIraq\u2019s Kurds are represented by two major parties, which since 2003 have \ncooperated in the government of the Kurdish Autonomous Region.  Both parties have \nsupported the U.S. presence in Iraq and played important roles in interim governments.  \nThe secular, nationalist Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) is the larger of the two \nparties and held one of two vice presidencies in the Interim Iraqi Government.  Founded \nby the main Kurdish tribe, the Barzanis, the KDP has established good relations with the \nTurkish government.  The Popular Union of Kurdistan, led by Jalal Talabani, also has a \nsecular nationalist agenda and represents Kurds closest to the Iran border.\u201d (HE A: \nCountry Profile: Iraq, Library of Congress Federal Research Division, August 2006, at \n20.) \n \n \nThe Peshmerga is an indigenous Kurdish military organization which operates as \nthe primary security force for the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq.  \nAuthority for Peshmerga\u2019s operations comes from Iraqi law and the constitution of Iraq.  \nU.S. troops do not operate in the Kurdish region.  The Kurdish areas are under Kurdish \nprovincial control and under the control of the region of Iraqi Kurdistan.  (HE A: Definiton \nof Peshmerga, Backgrounder: Iraq\u2019s Militia Groups, Counsel [sic?] on Foreign \nRelations; U.S. Department of State: Update from U.S. Embassy in Iraq, dated April 10, \n2008, at 2.) \n \n   \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Syria: \n \n \n\u201cSince March 1963, the Syrian Arab Republic has been ruled by an authoritarian \nregime.  Syria is currently included on the Department of State\u2019s List of State Sponsors \nof Terrorism due to the presence of several terrorist groups in Syria.  According to the \nDepartment of State, the Syrian Government continues to provide political and material \nsupport to Hezballah and Palestinian terrorist groups.  Several terrorist groups base \ntheir external leadership and maintain offices in Damascus.  In addition, Syria permits \nIran to transfer weapons and supplies through Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.  U.S. \nofficials criticized Syria for permitting shipments of arms from Iran to Hezbollah in \nLebanon that fueled the conflict between Lebanon and Israel in July 2006.  Similarly, \nSyria is \u2018one of the primary transit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq.\u2019  The \npreliminary findings of a United Nations investigation have indicated that the Syrian \nGovernment was involved in the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese \nPrime Minister Hariri, who actively opposed Syria\u2019 influence on Lebanese political \naffairs.\u201d  (HE 1: Syria: Summary at 1-2.) \n \n \n\u201cA Travel Warning is in effect for Syria following September 12, 2006 attacks on \nthe U.S. Embassy in Damascus.  In 1998 and 2000, mobs in Damascus attacked the \nU.S. Ambassador\u2019s Residence and the U.S. Embassy, respectively.\u201d  (HE 1: Syria: \nSummary at 2.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n\u201cDue to Syria\u2019s active and passive support of terrorism in the Middle East, \nPresident Bush signed an executive order implementing sanctions on May 11, 2004.  \nThese sanctions prohibit the export to Syria of products of the United States other than \nfood or medicine, and prohibit any commercial aircraft owned or controlled by the Syrian \nGovernment from taking off from or landing in the United States. On April 26, 2006, \nPresident Bush extended the May 11, 2004 executive order to block all property and \nproperty interests in the United States or in the possession and control of any United \nStates person that was involved in terrorist acts in Lebanon perpetrated by Syria on \nFebruary 14, 2005, or otherwise impeding the work of the Commission created to assist \nLebanon in identifying and punishing those responsible for the February 14, 2005 acts \nof terrorism. On February 13, 2008, President Bush again expanded the 2004 executive \norder to include those persons \u2018responsible for or otherwise significantly contributing to \nactions taken or decisions made by the Government of Syria that have the purpose or \neffect of undermining efforts to stabilize Iraq or of allowing the use of Syrian territory or \nfacilities to undermine efforts to stabilize Iraq.\u2019 \u201d (HE 1: Syria: Summary at 2-3.) \n \n \n\u201cThe Department of State\u2019s Report on Human Rights Practices for 2007 \ndescribes the Syrian Government\u2019s human rights record as \u2018worsened.\u2019  The report lists \nthe following human rights abuses occurring in Syria: absence of right to change \ngovernment, arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture in prison, poor prison \nconditions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, absence of rule of law, severely restricted \ncivil liberties, limited freedom of religion, government corruption and lack of \ntransparency, and violence against women.  Security forces frequently use torture, \nincluding against foreign citizens.  . . .  The four major branches of the Syrian security \nforces . . . devote resources to monitoring internal dissent and individual citizens, and \nthey operate outside the control of the legal system.  Security personnel have placed \nforeign visitors under surveillance, have monitored telephones, and have searched the \nhotel rooms and possessions of foreign visitors.\u201d  (HE 1: Syria: Summary at 3-4.)     \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The following facts raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d):1  \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.   \n \n \nIn 1973 and 1974, Applicant, then a citizen and resident of Iraq, was a member \nof a Kurdish political organization. He joined the organization to qualify for a job.  He \ncame to the United States in 1976 and became a U.S. citizen.  He has had no further \ncontact with the political organization. I conclude that his membership in the Kurdish \npolitical party is not a present security concern.  \n \nApplicant has nine adult siblings who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He is the \nonly sibling who has left Iraq and become a U.S. citizen. While progress has been made \nin stabilizing Iraq, many Iraqi citizens are experiencing disruptions that make it difficult \nto hold stable jobs. One of Applicant\u2019s brothers recently contacted him and requested \nmoney. Applicant responded to his request. Because he cannot support all of his \nrelatives who need money, Applicant does not have regular contact with his siblings. \nHowever, he is aware of their difficulties, and he helps them when he can.  \n \n Ethnic tensions in Iraq are strong and sometimes violent. After the fall of \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s government, one of Applicant\u2019s brothers received a death threat and \nwas forced to move his home. Since 2005, another brother has worked as a driver for a \nmilitary organization in Iraq, a job that could expose him to danger, violence, and the \nthreat of terrorism.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings in Iraq create a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, manipulation, or coercion, and his connections with them could \n \n1 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d) reads: \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect sensitive or \nclassified information and his desire to help his Iraqi Kurd relatives by providing that \ninformation. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s Iraqi family contacts and connections raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b67(b). \n   \nThe government of Syria sponsors and harbors terrorists.  Its security forces \ntarget and threaten foreign citizens. In 1988, Applicant, then a U.S. citizen, was \ndetained and questioned for several days by Syrian security forces before they \npermitted him to leave and return home to the United States. One of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nsiblings was persecuted by the Syrian government and forced to leave Syria. Applicant \nand his wife\u2019s family have direct knowledge of persecution by the forces of the \ngovernment of Syria.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Syria to Kurdish parents.  Her parents, now elderly, \nreside in Syria and are citizens of Syria.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law \nhave U.S. permanent resident status.  From about 2000 to 2004, they traveled yearly to \nthe United States from Syria and stayed with Applicant and his wife in the home they \nshared. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his wife\u2019s family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Syria also create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation, \nand coercion.  These connections could create a potential conflict of interest between \nApplicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive and classified information and his desire to \nhelp his Syrian relatives. Additionally, Applicant shares his home with his wife, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, whose parents are citizens and residents of Syria. Applicant \nhas shared his home with his Syrian relatives. These facts raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d). \n \nAn applicant has a heavy burden to show that he and his family members would \nnot be subject to undue influence by foreign agents or terrorists operating in Iraq and \nSyria. Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to rebut or mitigate these security \nconcerns. I conclude that the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are \ninapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant suffered a heart attack which made him unfit for heavy work as an automobile \nmechanic, a trade he had pursued for over 25 years. He knew Arabic, Farsi, and two \nKurdish dialects, and he sought work as a translator.  Because he was required to take \na prescribed blood thinner for his heart condition, he was not eligible to be assigned as \na translator in a war zone. His desire to serve his adopted country as a translator was \nadmirable but perhaps impractical. His connections to his family members in Iraq, a \ncountry that remains unstable and subject to terrorist acts, raised security concerns \nabout his potential for pressure and coercion. His connections to family members in \nSyria, an acknowledged state sponsor of terrorism and a country that had persecuted \nhim and a member of his wife\u2019s family, created an unacceptable risk of foreign influence \nor exploitation. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under the foreign \ninterest adjudicative guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 23, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on \nJune 16, 2008, and reassigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non July 17, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on August 12, 2008. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without objection. \nAugust 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nAugust 21, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, as contained in GE 3 through 5. These are \nInfoFacts sheets provided by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Institute of \nHealth, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Applicant did not object and the \nrequest was approved. The characteristics of these drugs are well known. While I have \nconsidered the nature of the drugs in my decision, I have not explicitly listed specific \nfacts about the drugs in the Findings of Facts. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with \nhis current employer since about August 2006. He is attending community college. He is \nsingle with no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant first smoked marijuana in about 1987, when he was in high school. He \ncontinued to smoke marijuana on an occasional basis until about June 2006. He \nestimated that he used marijuana about 20 times in the ten years between 1996 and \n2006. When he was a teenager, he and a friend tried to grow two marijuana plants with \nseeds from their marijuana. Both seeds sprouted but quickly died. He has not tried to \ngrow marijuana since. He also used heroin on one occasion in about 2004, and cocaine \non about two occasions in about 2005.2  \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on January 30, 2007. He completely listed his illegal drug use in the \nQuestionnaire. He also fully discussed his drug use during his background interview on \nAugust 17, 2007. He admitted that there was an impact on his judgment, reliability, and \nability to hold a confidence when he smoked marijuana. Applicant told the investigator \nthat he would never use cocaine or heroin again, but he could not absolutely rule out \nthe use of marijuana at some point in the future. Applicant later explained that he was \nattempting to be 100% honest with the investigator. He had no intention or \u201cdesire to \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 20-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nuse marijuana, but if, maybe five years from [then], it was offered to [him] in an ideal \nsocial setting. [he] might accept.\u201d3 \n \nSince the 2007 interview, Applicant\u2019s stance on marijuana has crystallized. In his \nresponse to the SOR he stated: \n \nIt was my hope that this statement would not lead to an understanding that \nI use marijuana because I do not. I have no desire to use marijuana now \nor in the future so I would like to clarify, for the record, that I will not use \nmarijuana in the future. Now that I understand it violates provisions in the \nDoD guidelines and since I honestly have no desire to try it again, I can \nassert that I will never use marijuana again. \n \n \nApplicant last used marijuana in June 2006, about two months before he started \nhis current job. He passed the employer\u2019s drug test, which is consistent with his \nstatements about his last use of marijuana. Applicant moved in November 2006 to a \ntown that is in the same general geographic area as he used to live, but fairly remote \nand relatively distant. He no longer associates with the people he used drugs with. He is \nfocused on school and his career. His current friends and associates do not use drugs. \nHe admitted that his drug use showed poor judgment. He stated unequivocally and \ncredibly that he will never use illegal drugs again. He is willing to sign a statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.4   \n \n \nApplicant submitted performance appraisals from 2007 and 2008. His 2007 \nappraisal reported that he \u201cworks well and gets along with all members of this team and \nis proving to be a valued member of this organization.\u201d His manager reported in 2008 \nthat he \u201cprovides superior customer satisfaction to all our customers and is a respected \nmember of the team.\u201d He has taken little or no time off since he started working. His \ncompany earnings statement reflects that Applicant works overtime, contributes to his \n401(k) retirement plan, and has accrued an extensive balance of vacation/paid time off \n(PTO).5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 27-34. \n \n5 Tr. at 17-18; AE A-C. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n5 \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession,6 use, and attempt to grow marijuana are sufficient \nto raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) as disqualifying conditions. His failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use in his 2007 interview raises AG \u00b6 25(h).  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using illegal drugs up until June 2006. His drug use was too \nrecent for him to receive the full benefit of AG \u00b6 26(a). In an attempt to be totally honest \nwith the background investigator in 2007, he stated that he could not completely rule out \nsmoking marijuana in the future. Since that interview, his intentions against using illegal \ndrugs have hardened. He has a good job with an established company. He made his \n                                                          \n6 Drugs must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nwork and education a priority. He moved away and no longer associates with people \nwho use drugs. He is willing to sign a statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 39 years old. Of \nconcern is his episodic drug use, which included experimentations with the harder \ndrugs, cocaine and heroin, and continued well into his 30s. He chose to break the law \nevery time he used illegal drugs. However, he presented himself as someone who has \nfinally matured and moved past the mistakes of the not-so-young. He has been \ncompletely forthright about his drug use throughout the process. I found him to be a \ntruthful, credible witness. When Applicant\u2019s drug use is looked at over the last ten years, \nit adds up to being extensive. But a closer examination reveals that it occurred several \ntimes a year. It was never frequent enough to dominate his life. He has moved on and is \ndedicated to education and his career. I am satisfied that illegal drugs are no longer a \npart of his life.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.
