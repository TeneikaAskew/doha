The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 9, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 20, \n2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non March 18, 2022, scheduling the hearing for March 22, 2022. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled.

After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 6 lines \n9~10.) He has been employed with the defense contractor for more than four years. (GX \n1 at page 11.) He currently does not hold a security clearance.

(TR at page 22 line 6 \nto page 27 line 4, and GX 2 at page 10.) He was required to attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings for six months, and also required to complete a \u201ca nine-\nmonth drug and alcohol course\u201d and \u201ca MADD class, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\u201d \n(TR at page 26 lines 6~14.) \n1.b., 1.d. and 2.a. About ten years later, Applicant was again arrested for Driving \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol. Pursuant to a plea bargain, the DUI charge was \ndismissed and Applicant was placed on unsupervised probation for five years, until \n2023. (TR at page 29 line 15 to page 35 line 4, and GX 2 at page 20.) He was also \nrequired to complete an 18-month DUI course, and attend AA meetings for 26 weeks. \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was also suspended. (GX 2 at page 20.) \n1.c. and 1.d. The following year, in September of 2019, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with Driving Without a License. (TR at page 38 line 7 to page 42 line 9, \nand GX 2 at page 21.) As part of his sentence, Applicant was placed on unsupervised \nprobation for three years, to run concurrent with the before-mentioned five-year \nprobation. (Id.) He is currently on probation. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions apply, as discussed below: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant has three arrests in the last 14 years. He is currently on probation for \ntwo of those three arrests. This evidence raises security concerns under these \ndisqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s last two arrests, for which he is \nstill on probation. Based on those facts, the evidence continues to cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The evidence does not \nestablish mitigation under any of the above conditions. Criminal Conduct is found \nagainst Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. One condition may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant has two alcohol related arrests, resulting in DUI court mandates. This \nevidence raises the above security concern, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nrebut, extenuate, or mitigate that concern. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related arrests is troublesome. He has two alcohol-\nrelated DUIs, the last one for which he is still on probation. This continues to cast doubt \non his trustworthiness. Upon successful completion of his probation, he may reapply for \na security clearance, but it is too soon to find the Government\u2019s alcohol concerns have \nbeen mitigated. Alcohol Consumption is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant\u2019s \nSection Manager has laudatory comment\u2019s as to Applicant\u2019s job performance. (AppX A.) \nHowever, his long criminal history; and his history of problematic alcohol consumption, \nwhich resulted in two DUIs, leave me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the criminal conduct, and alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided mitigating \ninformation. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since October 2018. (Tr. 8; GE 1) In 2000, he graduated from high school. (Tr. \n8) In 2019, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 8; AE 13) He served in the Navy from \n2007 to August 2016.

(Tr. 9) He was married from 2008 to 2011, and his two \nchildren are ages 12 and 14. (Tr. 10) His dating relationship with his former spouse \ncontinued until 2013. (Tr. 25) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant cited a contentious divorce in 2011 as the genesis of his financial \nproblems leading up to his 2014 bankruptcy. (Tr. 22) He had expensive legal bills because \nhis former spouse made allegations against him. (Tr. 23) He went back to family court \nthree or four times to clarify visitation rules. (Tr. 24) He was not deployed after 2012. (Tr. \n24) He was unemployed from August to October 2016, from January to September 2017, \nand from April to October 2018.

His unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $47,949. (GE 6 at 9) \nHis priority claims included $3,203 in taxes, $22,909 in student loans, and $1,394 in \ndomestic support. (Id. at 10) He owed federal income taxes for the following years: 2009 \n($906); 2011 ($736); 2012 ($781); and 2013 ($780). (Id. at 20) In his February 28, 2019 \nSCA he disclosed his bankruptcy in June 2014; however, he did not disclose that he failed \nto pay his federal taxes when required by law in the previous seven years. (GE 1 at 50) \nAt his hearing, he said he paid his federal income tax debt with refunds for subsequent \ntax years. (Tr. 26) However, he did not provide proof that his federal income taxes were \npaid. He received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 44; GE 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a judgment was entered against Applicant in April 2015 for \n$1,506. Payment was delayed because he could not locate the creditor. (Tr. 32) He \nemployed a lawyer to assist him in arranging payment. (Tr. 32) On August 27, 2021, he \npaid the judgment. (Tr. 31; AE 1) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e allege two judgments were entered against Applicant from the \nsame creditor in January 2016 for $503 and in February 2016 for $1,270. Applicant \nsatisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c on November 20, 2020, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e on \nDecember 11, 2020. (Tr. 38-39; SOR response at 3; AE 2-3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g allege two judgments for city tax debts entered against \nApplicant in February 2016 for $62 and in February 2018 for $62. (AE 5) Applicant \nasserted he did not owe the two debts, and that he had a letter showing payment for the \nfirst one in February 2016. (Tr. 35, 41) He did not provide a copy of the letter. On \nDecember 28, 2020, he satisfied the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and on December 16, 2020, \nhe satisfied the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Tr. 40-41; AE 6)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a judgment was entered against Applicant in March 2017 for \n$1,698. On May 3, 2021, he satisfied the judgment. (Tr. 40; AE 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i allege two charged-off debts for $451 and $863. On November \n18, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h wrote the debt was \u201csatisfied in full.\u201d (SOR \nresponse at 10) On November 24, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i wrote the \nlast payment was posted on November 20, 2020.

(Tr. 44) He has several \nnon-SOR debts, which are in paid or in paid as agreed status in his credit reports. (GE 2, \n3) \nCriminal Conduct \nThe SOR contains the following criminal conduct allegations: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) while in the \nNavy for falsifying dependency documentation in order to receive additional financial \nbenefits. In his February 28, 2019 SCA Applicant said he received NJP in October 2014 \nfor \u201cfailure to obey an order [and] false statements.\u201d (GE 1 at 25) He was \u201cfound guilty,\u201d \nand he received 45 days of extra duty. (Id.) He said his command learned he was not \nmarried when his former spouse called his command and informed them of the change \nin his marital status. (Tr. 52) Applicant admitted that he failed to update his personnel \nrecords to reflect his divorce. (Tr. 50) Applicant told an OPM investigator that the \nfalsification related to an allegation he was claiming \u201cadditional funds on his taxes.\u201d (GE \n13 at 2) He said it was an oversight, and he did not receive any additional benefits. (Tr. \n52-53) \nIn his follow-up September 17, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said his former \nspouse was listed as his dependent on his military dependency document, which would \nhave incorrectly entitled her to military/TRICARE medical benefits, use of the \ncommissary, possession of a Navy identification card, etc. (GE 13 at 8) He received 45 \ndays of extra duty, reduction to E-4 (suspended), and forfeiture of $1,213 pay per month \nfor two months (suspended) from his commander as a result of the NJP disposition. (Tr. \n53-54; GE 13 at 8) There is no record evidence that Applicant received more pay due to \nhis records incorrectly indicating he was married in 2014 when he was actually divorced \nin 2011. There is no evidence his former spouse fraudulently received medical care or \nother benefits to which she was not entitled due to his failure to timely update his \npersonnel records concerning his divorce. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant pleaded no contest for violation of a custody or \nprotection order in February 2016. Applicant said from 2012 to 2017, his former spouse \n\u201cliterally made [his] life a living hell by filing false undocumented claims of things like \nabuse, stalking, kidnapping, just \u2013 you name it. Anything regarding her and the children, \nshe filed it.\u201d (Tr. 55) She alleged that he beat his children with a belt, punched his eight-\nyear-old son, and that he hit his son\u2019s head against a concrete wall, giving him a \nconcussion. (Tr. 61-62) Applicant claimed the judge told him that a no contest plea, \u201cWell, \nit doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty or not guilty . . . but we can conclude this case \u2013 by that \nplea.\u201d (Tr. 56) Applicant decided that it would be best to expedite resolution of the charge \nwith a no contest plea. (Tr. 56) He received a fine and a suspended jail sentence.

(Tr. 55-59) \nApplicant denied that he physically abused his former spouse or his children. (Tr.\n64) In order to avoid conflict with his former spouse, Applicant has ensured that he has \nnot had any contact with his former spouse since 2016. (Tr. 52, 60, 67)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant received excellent Navy evaluation reports from 2011 to 2014. (AE 9-AE \n11) He received a negative Navy evaluation report in 2015, which cited his NJP, and in \n2016, which cited his violation of the protection order. (GE 13 at 8-9) He received the \nfollowing Navy medals and awards: two Navy Good Conduct Medals, a letter of \ncommendation; three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals; National Defense \nService Medal; Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal; two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons; and Navy Expert Pistol Medal. (Tr. \n20; AE 8, AE 12) He received an early promotion to petty officer second class. (Tr. 20) \nHe received a certificate of recognition, and his current employer has promoted him. (Tr. \n20; AE 14) He received a certificate of voluntary service from the state public schools, \nand he is a state basketball official. (AE 15; AE 16) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant described several circumstances beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. His contentious divorce in 2011 led to his 2014 bankruptcy. He had \nexpensive legal bills because his former spouse made allegations against him. He was \nunemployed from August to October 2016, from January to September 2017, and from \nApril to October 2018. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in \nwhole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still \nconsider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \nseveral SOR creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \nHe did not prove that he maintained contact with several of his SOR creditors or that he \nmade offers to make partial payments to them prior to 2020. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to disclose on his February 28, 2019 \nSCA that he owed $3,203 in federal income taxes in 2014 when he filed for bankruptcy \nfor the following years: 2009 ($906); 2011 ($736); 2012 ($781); and 2013 ($780).

In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged \nin an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nAn administrative judge is \u201crequired to examine all the circumstances surrounding \nthe debts and their eventual satisfaction\u201d including the timing of any settlements, \napplicant\u2019s salary for the past several years, and whether a debt or debts \u201chad already \nbeen reduced to judgment.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01656 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2022) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005)). The Appeal Board has noted, \n\u201can applicant who resolves financial problems after being placed on notice his or her \nsecurity clearance may be in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self discipline to follow \nrules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his [or her] own \ninterests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01213 (App. Bd. June 29, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016)). \nAfter Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy in 2014, creditors obtained six judgments against him. \nTwo additional debts were charged off, and three additional debts were placed for \ncollection. Applicant receives some credit for beginning to resolve his delinquent debts \nbefore the SOR was issued; however, all 11 of the SOR debts were resolved after the \nSOR was issued on October 5, 2020. There was no evidence presented of any efforts to \nresolve any SOR debts before his OPM interview. Applicant did not provide a budget or \nother documentation about his financial resources or show he was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving his delinquent SOR debts before the SOR was issued. \u201cIn this regard, \nthe Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect an \napplicant to present documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve debts.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 19-03757 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020)). \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more documented progress \nresolving his delinquent debts before the SOR was issued. There is insufficient assurance \nthat his financial problems will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he \nfailed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). Discussion of the disqualifying \nconditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant received NJP in October 2014 for failure to obey an order and false \nstatements. He failed to update his personnel records to reflect his divorce. His former \nspouse was listed as his dependent on his military dependency document, which would \nhave incorrectly entitled her to military/TRICARE medical and other benefits. He received \n45 days of extra duty, reduction to E-4 (suspended), and forfeiture of $1,213 pay per \nmonth for two months (suspended) from his commander as a result of the NJP disposition. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of violation of a custody or protection order in February \n2016. He received a suspended jail sentence. The Navy based his discharge on his \nconviction. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal offenses are not recent. He is no longer involved with his \nformer spouse. Criminal offenses are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. Criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J and \nF are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since October 2018. In 2019, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He served in the \nNavy from 2007 to August 2016, and he received a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. He was a petty officer second class when he was discharged. He received \nexcellent Navy evaluation reports from 2011 to 2014. He received several Navy medals \nand awards. He received a certificate of recognition, and his current employer has \npromoted him. He received a certificate of voluntary service from the state public schools, \nand he is a state basketball official.   \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. His bankruptcy was a reasonable \ndecision in light of his substantial delinquent debts. His criminal conduct is not recent and \nis unlikely to recur. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nHe received a fresh financial start after his bankruptcy in 2014, and then he began \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccumulating new delinquent debts.

The 11 SOR debts \nwere resolved after his SOR was issued in October 2020. He did not provide \ndocumentation about why he was unable to make greater documented progress sooner \nresolving several delinquent SOR debts. His financial history raises unmitigated questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \n\u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant mitigated criminal conduct security concerns; \nhowever, he failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. and 1.b. Applicant has past-due debts totaling about $10,027 to Creditor A, as the result of motor vehicle repossession. He has done little if anything to address this past-due debt, which appears on his July 2021 credit report.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December \n9, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor for \u201cabout six-and-a-half years.\u201d (TR at page 12 \nlines 2~5, and GX 1 at page 7.) He is single and has no children. (TR at page 13 lines \n14~22.) Applicant attributes the alleged past-due indebtedness to a period of \nunemployment or underemployment \u201cbetween 2013 to 2015.\u201d (TR at page 22 lines \n16~19.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant has past-due debts totaling about $10,027 to Creditor A, \nas the result of motor vehicle repossession. He has done little if anything to address this \npast-due debt, which appears on his July 2021 credit report. (TR at page 24 line 2 to \npage 29 line 10, at page 36 line 15 to page 37 line 24, at page 38 line 11 to page 39 line \n9, and GX 4 at page 6.) These allegations are found against Applicant. \n1.c.~1.h. Applicant had past-due student loan debts totaling about $32,607 to \nCreditor C. Applicant has resolved these debts by way of garnishment; and as such, \nthey are no longer reflected as past-due on the Government\u2019s July 2021 credit report. \n(TR at page 29 line 11 to page 34 line 24, GX 4 and AppX B.) These allegations are \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.a. Applicant knew or should have known of his past-due indebtedness, noted \nabove under Financial Considerations, when he executed his September 2019 \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to \nSection 26 as to his having financial delinquencies \u201cin the past sever (7) years.\u201d (TR at \npage 14 line 11 to page 24 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 32~33.) I find this to be a willful \nfalsification. This allegation is found against Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a past-due debt due to a vehicle repossession, and had significant \npast-due student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Although he has paid his delinquent student loans, he still has a past-\ndue debt as the result of a motor vehicle repossession. He has not demonstrated that \nfuture financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been \nestablished. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative \nApplicant was less than candid in answering Section 26 on his 2019 e-QIP.

Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully \nNeither of these apply. Applicant intentionally falsified his 2019 e-QIP. Personal \nConduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace. (AppX A.) However, overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant admits that in April of 2018, he was arrested for and pled \nguilty to Driving Under the Influence-Second Offense. As a result of this conviction, \nApplicant was required to complete a court-ordered evaluation and counseling program. \n1.d. Applicant denies that, from September 2018 to March 2019, he received \ntreatment for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder. However, this is \ncontradicted by the \u201cCompletion Summary\u201d from an \u201cImpaired Driver Program,\u201d dated \nMarch 25, 2019, which states Applicant\u2019s \u201cCurrent Diagnosis: Alcohol Use Disorder, \nmild, in early remission.\u201d (Item 8 at pages 1~2.) \n1.e. Applicant denies that he continued to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his \ntreatment noted in subparagraph 1.d., above. However, this is contradicted by \nApplicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, dated November 12, 2020, wherein Applicant \nadmits he consumed \u201c2~3\u201d beers on September 29, 2020, about two weeks prior to \nanswering the interrogatories. (Item 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents between November 2014 and April \n2018. He was also diagnosed as suffering from an alcohol use disorder. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related conviction was about four years ago; but despite \nbeing diagnosed as suffering from an alcohol use disorder in March of 2019, he still \nconsumed alcohol until at least September of 2020, about 18 months ago. Alcohol \nConsumption is found against Applicant. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related convictions. This evidence raises security \nconcerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s most recent, 2018, DUI, given \nthe fact that he was previously convicted of a DUI in 2017, and had another alcohol-\nrelated conviction in 2014. Criminal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from his alcohol consumption, and related criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since about December 2016. He has a high school diploma, \nearned a certificate from a technical college, and attended college courses without \nearning an undergraduate degree.

He \nhas been married since 1984 and has one adult child. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20; GE 1, 2; \nAE A) \nApplicant has a significant history of alcohol-related criminal offenses. In about \nJanuary 1999, he was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in State A. Applicant \nhad been drinking at a bar and decided to drive home after a taxi cab he called did not \nshow up. Applicant also claimed that he sought assistance with a cab from someone \nwho worked at the bar, but they would not help him. He had a .15 or higher blood \nalcohol content (BAC) at the time of his arrest. He pleaded guilty to DWI. Applicant\u2019s \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for a year and he was placed on probation for a year. \nHe was also required to undergo court-ordered alcohol-related counseling and he had \nto pay $500 in fines. Applicant did not believe that he had a drinking problem and did \nnot undertake alcohol-related counseling beyond that mandated by the court. Applicant \ndid not list this arrest in his 2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). \nHe also admitted to this offense during his 2018 security interview only after being \nconfronted by his investigator. (Tr. 20-22, 37, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that he stopped drinking for about five or six years after his \n1999 DWI arrest until about 2006. He stopped drinking during this time period because \nof his military obligations and because he was often on-call for work. Applicant claimed \nthat from 2006 until 2010, he drank occasionally, but did not get \u201chammered.\u201d (Tr. 37, \n42-43) \nDespite allegedly not consuming alcohol during this time period, Applicant was \narrested in July 2004 in State A and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). \nAccording to the police report, he was pulled over for speeding after driving his \nmotorcycle 62 miles per hour in a location where the speed limit was 35 miles per hour. \nThe police officer reported that Applicant had trouble stabilizing his motorcycle during \nthe stop and the officer smelled the strong odor of alcohol from Applicant\u2019s person and \nbreath. While Applicant claimed that he was not drinking alcohol at the time, the police \nofficer reported that Applicant told him that he had a \u201cfew.\u201d Applicant denied having this \nconversation with the police officer or that he made the statement that he had been \ndrinking. The police officer noted that Applicant had a hard time keeping his balance \nand had a \u201cstaggering walk.\u201d Applicant refused field sobriety tests, reportedly stating, \n\u201cnot just no, but hell no,\u201d and was arrested.

His plan was to go to \ntrial to try to expose what he considered to be corruption, but he claimed that he was \nnot permitted to put on evidence at trial of his being unfairly targeted. He was tried and \nconvicted by a jury of DUI. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year. He \nspent two days in jail and had to pay approximately $1,500 in fines. He was placed on \nsupervised probation for approximately 16 months. Applicant denied the SOR allegation \nrelating to this arrest because he believes that the arrest was improper and because the \nSOR alleged that the arrest occurred in State B when it actually took place in State A. \nHe admitted at hearing that the SOR allegation referring to the 2004 DUI arrest would \nhave been accurate had it alleged that the arrest occurred in State A. Applicant knew \nthat the allegation concerning the 2004 DUI arrest in State B was, in actuality, referring \nto the 2004 DUI arrest in State A. I base this finding on his admission that the allegation \nwould have been accurate had the location been changed and his ability to describe \nwith specificity the circumstances surrounding the 2004 DUI arrest, as well as what he \nperceived to be its factual and procedural shortcomings. I also base this finding on the \nlack of any other DUI arrest, regardless of jurisdiction, within approximately five years of \nthe 2004 arrest. (Tr. 20-21, 23-25, 43-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6) \nIn June 2010, Applicant was involved in a single vehicle accident in State B. His \ninjuries as a result of this accident were severe enough that he had to be flown by \nhelicopter to a nearby hospital. The police officer who responded to the accident noted \nthat Applicant smelled of alcohol and that there were several empty beer cans near \nApplicant and the crashed vehicle. The police officer did not charge Applicant with DUI \nat the scene because of the seriousness of his injuries, but requested that the hospital \ndraw blood from Applicant so that it could be tested for alcohol. The hospital performed \na blood draw of Applicant while he was being treated for his injuries and the result was \na BAC of .351. Applicant remained in the hospital for about three days. A few months \nlater, the police officer who responded to the accident personally served Applicant with \na citation for DUI. Applicant acknowledged that he was impaired by alcohol at the time \nof the accident and that he had been drinking alone while fishing. Applicant claimed that \nhis BAC was incorrectly calculated, as he speculated without any basis, that the testing \ncould not account for the time lapse between the blood draw and the testing. Applicant \ndoes not believe that he had a drinking problem at the time and did not undergo any \nalcohol counseling as a result of this accident. He denied the SOR allegation alleging \nthis incident because he believes that he was never charged with or convicted of DUI. \nDespite the seriousness of the accident and Applicant\u2019s extremely high BAC, the \ncharges against him were dismissed. (Tr. 26, 28, 30-31, 38-44, 46-49; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5) \nIn about December 2017, Applicant was arrested in State B and charged with his \nfourth DUI. Applicant was arrested after another person driving on the same road \nreported to police that they saw his vehicle weaving on the road. Applicant claimed that \nhe was not intoxicated at the time. He admitted to having had about six ounces of liquor, \nbut claimed that he was weaving because his dog that was in his car distracted him. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed his field sobriety test as it was discontinued because he fell twice while \nperforming it. Applicant again refused any chemical tests to determine his BAC, but a \njudge issued a warrant for two vials of his blood. Police took two vials of Applicant\u2019s \nblood pursuant to the search warrant and his blood was tested for alcohol. The results \nof the test were that Applicant had a .14 BAC with a level of confidence greater than \n99.73%. Applicant was convicted, had to attend alcohol counseling, which he \ncompleted, and had an ignition interlock device installed on his vehicle for two years. \nAfter his 2017 conviction, he admitted that he had a problem with alcohol. He claimed \nthat he modified his behavior by drinking less alcohol and taking more taxis and Ubers. \nHe stated that he switched to only drinking beer and cutting out hard liquor. He testified \nthat after his 2017 DUI, he only drinks a couple of beers on a weekend and he no longer \ndrinks and drives. Applicant also credits having his wife move to State B in May 2022 to \nlive together full time as a positive factor that keeps him out of trouble. (Tr. 26-30, 32-\n33, 35-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder. Applicant claimed that no alcohol counselor or medical professional has \nadvised him to stop drinking, but did not provide any other evidence of treatment \nrecommendations. He has not undergone any alcohol counseling beyond what was \ncourt ordered. He claimed that he has reduced his drinking from a 12 pack of beer over \nthe course of a weekend to \u201cpretty much nothing\u201d in about 2010. He acknowledged that \nhe continued to drink and drive between 2010 and 2017, but that he has not done so \nafter his 2017 DUI. He claimed that the higher amount of alcohol he drank before his \n2017 DUI was an aberration. (Tr. 35-41) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b inaccurately reflects the location of the 2004 DUI arrest as State B \nwhen the evidence shows that it took place in State A. As Applicant was aware of the \nerror and understood that the alleged disqualifying conduct related to the 2004 DUI \narrest in State A, I find that SOR \u00b6 1.b provided Applicant with sufficient notice to meet \napplicable due process requirements. \nApplicant was charged with or cited for DUI or DWI in 1999, 2004, 2010, and \n2017. Applicant\u2019s elevated BAC for at least three of these DUIs (.15, .351, and .14), and \nhis repeatedly getting behind the wheel after drinking, show habitual or binge drinking \nthat leads to poor judgment. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying conditions \napplicable and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nBetween 1999 and 2017, Applicant was excessively consuming alcohol often \nenough to be charged with an alcohol-related driving offense once every five or six \nyears. While it has now been five years since his last DUI, his previously established \npattern causes me to doubt that enough time has passed to show that his excessive \nalcohol consumption is unlikely to recur. This pattern also detracts from his ability to \ndemonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \nWhile Applicant alleged that he has modified his alcohol consumption, he has \ndone so after earlier DUIs only to be charged again. He has completed court-ordered \nalcohol counseling, but has not provided evidence of any treatment recommendations. \nTherefore, he cannot show that his modified consumption complies with those \nrecommendations. Accordingly, Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy, honorable military service and his multiple deployments. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 51 years old. He attended college, but did not earn a diploma. He was married twice, both ending in divorce. He is in a long-term relationship and lives with his fianc\u00e9e. They have been together for about 10 years. He has no children. Applicant has worked for his present employer since June 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-15) Applicant testified that he began drinking alcohol to excess when he was about 30 years old. He would consume alcohol every day. He continued this pattern until about 2010, when he reduced his drinking to three to four beers a day or every other day. He continued this pattern until about 2016. (Tr. 21-23) Applicant testified that he has been on medication since about 2005 for depression, which he said runs in his family. From 2012 to 2015, he was seen at a mental health clinic for his depression. He was not being seen for his alcohol issues. He began seeing a psychiatrist-psychologist (Dr. G) in 2015. This was the first time his alcohol issues were addressed along with his depression. He had been advised by Dr. G to not consume alcohol while on prescribed medication. He did not follow his Dr. G\u2019s advice and continued to consume alcohol.

There were \nno objections and GE 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript on December 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old. He attended college, but did not earn a diploma. He was \nmarried twice, both ending in divorce. He is in a long-term relationship and lives with his \nfianc\u00e9e. They have been together for about 10 years. He has no children. Applicant has \nworked for his present employer since June 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-15) \nApplicant testified that he began drinking alcohol to excess when he was about 30 \nyears old. He would consume alcohol every day. He continued this pattern until about \n2010, when he reduced his drinking to three to four beers a day or every other day. He \ncontinued this pattern until about 2016. (Tr. 21-23) \nApplicant testified that he has been on medication since about 2005 for \ndepression, which he said runs in his family. From 2012 to 2015, he was seen at a mental \nhealth clinic for his depression. He was not being seen for his alcohol issues. He began \nseeing a psychiatrist-psychologist (Dr. G) in 2015. This was the first time his alcohol \nissues were addressed along with his depression. He had been advised by Dr. G to not \nconsume alcohol while on prescribed medication. He did not follow his Dr. G\u2019s advice and \ncontinued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 27-30, 39-40) \nIn January 2016, reacting to the death of David Bowie, Applicant brought alcohol \n(vodka) to work with him to drink. He said he did not normally bring alcohol to work. Later \nin the day, he purchased beer and brought it back to the office. He drank the vodka and \nabout 12 beers. He became intoxicated and drove his car, which he crashed into a pole \nafter falling asleep. He was uninjured and his fianc\u00e9e drove him home. The police were \nnot notified. (Tr. 23-27) \nApplicant stated that prior to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work on a couple of \noccasions. He would bring the alcohol to work with him. He remembered drinking at work \none day in the summer of 2015 as a coping mechanism because his mother was in the \nhospital. He had about three beers. A month later he did the same thing for the same \nreason. He estimated from 2015 to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work about four times. \n(Tr. 36-38) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant was advised by Dr. G to stop consuming alcohol. Applicant \ntestified that Dr. G referred to him as a \u201cdrunk.\u201d He said that this was the first time he was \never told to stop drinking. He said he attempted to abstain, could not, but reduced his \nconsumption. Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with unspecified Alcohol Use Disorder. Applicant \nconsumed alcohol before a couple of his appointments with Dr. G. On one occasion, he \nwas told to wait for transportation to be arranged because it was unsafe for Applicant to \ndrive. He left the office without waiting. Applicant was also seeing a therapist once a \nmonth in conjunction with Dr. G. Applicant testified that in 2017 he stopped seeing Dr. G \nbecause he did not have a good rapport with him and was unhappy with being referred \nto as a \u201cdrunk\u201d instead of an alcoholic. He also stopped seeing the therapist. Dr. G\u2019s \nmedical notes state that Applicant was terminated as a patient in November 2017, due to \na pattern of noncompliance with treatment recommendations, multiple relapses of alcohol \nabuse, not seeking a 12-step program, not seeking psychotherapy, and leaving the \nwaiting room when mildly intoxicated after agreeing that his fianc\u00e9e would come pick him \nup because he should not be driving. (Tr. 27-30, 39-41; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that the accident was a wake-up call to him regarding his alcohol \nabuse. He attempted to stop drinking, but could abstain for only short periods. He \ncontinued to consume alcohol daily from 2016 until he started his current job in June \n2018. He said he cut back on his daily drinking because it was inconsistent with his \nemployment. He testified he was only drinking on the weekends during this time. \nApplicant testified that in late 2019, he abstained from alcohol consumption for nine \nmonths. He felt his prescribed medication was working, and he was enjoying life. He said \nhe did not plan to abstain from alcohol consumption forever and thought he would resume \nconsumption at some point. In 2021, he resumed consuming alcohol. He testified he \ndrinks on the weekends during football season and perhaps on a few special occasions \nsuch as birthdays. He consumes about a six-pack of beer on Saturdays and Sundays \nwith his fianc\u00e9e. (Tr. 18-20, 27-35) \nApplicant testified that in 2018, he began seeing Dr. Z about every two to three \nmonths to have his prescriptions refilled for his depression. He was advised by Dr. Z to \nnot consume alcohol while taking the depression medications. Dr. Z would ask him \u201cwhere \nhis brain was at?\u201d (Tr. 42) He said he was prescribed Antabuse by Dr. Z. He took it for six \nmonths and stopped drinking. He said that Dr. Z decided in early 2021 to stop the \nAntabuse because Applicant was not drinking. Applicant testified that he told Dr. Z that \nhe had resumed consuming alcohol, but it was controlled. He admitted he has attempted \nto abstain from alcohol consumption on several occasions in the past, but would always \nresume drinking. (Tr. 15, 41-46) \nApplicant testified that he believed in the past he resorted to alcohol use when \nunder stress, but does not do this any longer. He said he is in a different place now than \nwhen the security clearance process started. His believes his brain is sharper, and he \nsolves problems better. He is not willing to abstain from alcohol consumption because he \nenjoys drinking while watching football on the weekends. He said he has been seeing a \ntherapist since mid-2020 about once a month due to his mother\u2019s passing. He consumed \nalcohol when his mother and sister passed away in 2019 and 2020.

During this time, he was drinking about 12 beers on each day of \nthe weekend. (Tr. 16-18, 46-50) \nDOD CAF requested a psychological evaluation of Applicant and it was conducted \nin \nFebruary \n2020 \nby \na \nlicensed \nclinical \npsychologist \nand \nboard-certified \nneuropsychologist. Applicant told the psychologist that after his 2016 car accident it was \na wake-up call and he stopped drinking alcohol completely for a few years, but in the last \nsix months he and his fianc\u00e9e occasionally have a couple of glasses of wine on the \nweekends. He said he is not addicted to alcohol anymore. He did not freely report that he \nhad seen his psychiatrist after consuming alcohol. He told the psychologist that he only \ndrank beer. He was confronted with Dr. G\u2019s medical records from October 2017, where it \nwas noted he was drinking a fifth of vodka or rum per day. He admitted that he did so \nbriefly after his sister\u2019s passing. (Tr. 52-54; GE 2) \nThe psychologist noted during the evaluation that Applicant was not defensive, but \nwas not forthcoming with information. When directly questioned about information, he \nnever denied the incidents, but seemed to minimize them. During the testing process, she \nnoted that he also was not completely forthcoming in his responses. She indicated that \ngiven his response style and tendency to withhold information during the interview unless \ndirectly confronted, his test results are unlikely to capture any true psychological \nconditions and reflect only his own self-description. She noted that his profile indicates \npoor insight into his history of alcohol misuse, or the difficulties alcohol use has had in his \nlife. His interest in and motivation for treatment is below average compared to adults who \nare not being seen in a therapeutic setting, and a great deal lower than those in treatment \nsettings. She stated: \u201cThis indicates that he is satisfied with himself as he is, and sees \nlittle need for changes in his behavior. As such, he is likely to be reluctant to commit to \ntherapy.\u201d (GE 2) \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use Disorder-Severe; \nMajor Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate. She found that Applicant \ncontinues to consume alcohol and has not undergone treatment for alcohol use \ndisorder. She has concerns that he is a high risk for relapse. She observed \nthat during their interview, Applicant either lacked insight into his problematic \nalcohol use or was intentionally attempting to downplay his alcohol use. \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis is guarded and his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness is \nlikely to be impaired. (Tr. 52-54; GE 2)\nDuring his hearing, Applicant admitted that he was not truthful to the psychologist \nduring his interview. He said he was embarrassed to admit his alcohol use. When asked \nwhat has changed, he said he is getting older and more honest. He does not think \nalcohol impacts his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. He said he tried Alcoholics \nAnonymous in 2018, but does not like the religious connotations. He now practices \nmeditation and yoga. (Tr. 52-54) \nApplicant consumes alcohol on the weekends with his fianc\u00e9e. She consumes \nabout the same amount of alcohol as he does. During a typical month during the football \nseason, they will watch games at their house on two weekends and the other two they\ngo \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nto one of his sisters\u2019 houses, which are about ten miles away.

He said I\u2019m not super intoxicated, I\u2019m just sort of a little \nbuzzed.\u201d (Tr. 58) He admitted he would likely be over the legal limit. When asked why \nwould he risk driving, he said they just want to get home. He estimated he has done this \nabout four or five times. He believes he had an alcohol problem in the past, but no longer \ndoes. He does not intend to abstain from alcohol consumption because he enjoys it. He \nstated that when football season is over, he will stop drinking. However, he intends to \nresume when the new season starts. I did not find Applicant credible (Tr. 46-47, 54-60) \nApplicant testified that he is embarrassed about not being forthright about his \ndrinking. He is stronger now and is not going to let alcohol take over his life. He loves his \njob and has been taking classes to improve his chances for professional advancement. \n(Tr. 52-54) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol\nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;\n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in\nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the\nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol\nuse disorder;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g.\nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social\nworker) of alcohol use disorder;\n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narising from alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder AG \u00b6 23: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-\n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.\nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse, which includes consuming alcohol \nat work on multiple occasions, habitually drinking large amounts of alcohol at one time; \ndriving after consuming alcohol and driving his car into a tree. He admitted driving after \nconsuming alcohol when he believed he was over the legal limit after drinking with his \nfianc\u00e9e. In 2016, he was diagnosed by Dr. G with Alcohol Abuse Disorder, Unspecified \nand told to stop consuming alcohol. Applicant continued to consume alcohol. In 2017, \nhe was terminated as a patient by Dr. G due to his noncompliance with treatment \nrecommendations to abstain from consumption and multiple relapses. Additionally, he \nleft the doctor\u2019s office after consuming alcohol and failed to wait for transportation, after \nwhich his doctor terminated him as a patient. In 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by a \nduly qualified psychologist, with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. The evidence supports \nthe application of the all of the above disqualifying conditions. \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith nay required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol after he was diagnosed with Alcohol \nAbuse Disorder and told to abstain. He continues to be irresponsible and drive after he \nhas been drinking, acknowledging he felt \u201ca little buzzed\u201d and was likely over the legal \nlimit. The evidence supports that despite the negative impact and repeated treatment \nrecommendations, Applicant has not changed his behavior and does not intend to do so. \nHe does not believe alcohol impairs his judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions \napply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness.\nApplicant failed to be honest and forthcoming during the testing process as part \nof his psychological evaluation and withheld information during his interview unless \ndirectly confronted. He was diagnosed by a duly qualified psychologist with Alcohol \nAbuse Disorder, Severe and Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate. His \nprognosis is guarded and his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness is likely to be \nimpaired. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from  psychological \n \nconditions. \n \nThe following \n \nmitigating conditions \n \n under AG \u00b6 29 \nwere considered\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan;\n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program\nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n-\nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nThe evidence is insufficient to conclude any of the above mitigating conditions \napply. There is not a favorable prognosis from a duly qualified medical professional, or a \nrecent medical opinion that Applicant\u2019s condition is under control, in remission, or has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation. I do not have evidence that Applicant is \nparticipating in a treatment program or is amenable to treatment. Applicant\u2019s \npsychological condition is not temporary and has not been resolved. I find none of the \nabove mitigating conditions apply.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \n \n \n \n \n \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to any employer, investigator, security \n \n \n \n \n \nofficial, competent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other official \n \n  \n \n  \n \ngovernment representative;\n \n \n and. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n-\nApplicant failed to be honest and forthcoming during the testing process as part of \nhis psychological evaluation and withheld information during his interview unless directly \nconfronted. He provided misleading or false information to the psychologist that \ncontradicted information in his medical record with regards to his use of alcohol. The \nabove disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant did not correct the false information he provided to the psychologist until \nhe was confronted with contradictory information. Failing to be truthful during a \npsychological evaluation is not minor. The evidence is insufficient to conclude it is unlikely \nto recur. It casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant \ntestified during his hearing that he was embarrassed to admit his transgressions during \nthe evaluation, which support he acknowledges his past behavior. However, there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude he has taken positive steps to alleviate the factors that \ncontributed to his conduct because he continues to consume alcohol, engage in risky \nbehavior, and does not believe his alcohol consumption impairs his judgment, despite \nroutinely driving after drinking. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, I, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 51 years \n \nold \n \nwith a  long  history \n \n of excessive \n \nalcohol  use. He has been  \n \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Abuse Disorder, Severe. He does not intend to abstain from\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \n  \n \nalcohol use or seek treatment. He continues to drink alcohol to excess and drive. He failed \nto meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline \nE, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

SOR \u00b6 3.b cross alleges the conduct set forth \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nIn 2016, Applicant was depressed after returning to the United States from Korea, \nand he was having problems in his marriage. (Tr. 30; GE 3 at 3) On about 10 occasions \nover a three to four-month period, he surfed the Internet with his cell phone looking for \ndating opportunities and because of curiosity. (Tr. 31, 32-33) \nOn or about December 14, 2016, Applicant located and responded to an \nadvertisement about dating and sexual encounters. (Tr. 29-30) He was 34 years old in \nDecember 2016. (Tr. 37) After about 10 emails back and forth over several hours, the \nperson (Ms. C) advised Applicant that she was 14 years old. (Tr. 36) Applicant said he \n\u201creplied, no, you\u2019re not. [H]e just didn\u2019t believe\u201d Ms. C. (Tr. 36) He wanted proof of Ms. \nC\u2019s age, and he engaged in commentary back and forth with Ms. C about her age. (Tr. \n36) Eventually, he came to believe Ms. C was actually 14 years old. (Tr. 44) He never \ncommunicated with Ms. C over the telephone. (Tr. 36) He knew sexual communications \nwith an underage person was illegal. (Tr. 37) He expressed concern to Ms. C about being \ndiscovered. (Tr. 38) Despite this concern, he communicated about sexual matters to Ms. \nC, a female he believed to be 14 years old, because of his fantasy. (Tr. 38; GE 6) He \ncould not or would not disclose details about the fantasy at his hearing. (Tr. 38-39, 66) \nHe never disclosed details about the fantasy to anyone; however, he denied that his \nfantasy was to engage in sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant requested that Ms. C send him nude pictures of herself including her \ngenitalia. (Tr. 40, 44) Ms. C did not send him any pictures; however, he sent her three \npictures of himself: one of his face, and two of his genitalia. (Tr. 40-41) He was unsure \nwhether she asked for the pictures. (Tr. 64) He sent one picture of his genitalia after he \nlearned Ms. C was 14 years old. (Tr. 41) In emails, he offered to teach Ms. C how to \nperform various explicit sexual acts. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He provided Ms. C with information \nabout websites for the purpose of having her view pornographic videos. (Tr. 44; GE 6) He \ndenied that he suggested that Ms. C go to any Internet sites containing child pornography. \n(Tr. 63-64) He also offered to perform sex acts on Ms. C, and he requested that she \nperform sex acts on him. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He said exceptionally gross things to Ms. C about \nwhat he wanted to do with his bodily fluids. (GE 5; GE 6) Applicant asked Ms. C to meet \nhim during the day where they could be alone because he was worried about being caught \nby law enforcement. (Tr. 43; GE 6) \nOn December 29, 2016, an Air Force investigator interviewed Applicant about his \ncommunications with Ms. C, and he admitted the allegations.

(Tr. 62-63) \nIn about July 2017, Applicant received NJP under Article 80, UCMJ, for attempting \nto commit a lewd act upon a child by intentionally exposing his genitalia via \ncommunication technology to a person he believed to be 14 years old, but had not \nattained the age of 16 years.

(HE 3) He is doing everything he \ncan to show he is rehabilitated and deserves a security clearance. (Id.) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided statements from nine character witnesses, including his \nmother-in-law, father-in-law, supervisor, pastor, friends, and coworkers, one of whom also \nmade a statement at his hearing. (Tr. 20-24; AE A) The general sense of the \nrecommendations is that Applicant shows courtesy, professionalism, honesty, sincerity, \ntrustworthiness, diligence, and reliability. He has a law-abiding character. His character \nevidence letters support approval of his access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nIn December 2016, Applicant admitted to an Air Force investigator that he sent a \npicture of his genitalia to and solicited a sex act from Ms. C, a person he believed to be \n14 years old. In about July 2017, his commander found in an NJP proceeding that he \nviolated Article 80, UCMJ, by attempting to commit a lewd act upon a child by intentionally \nexposing his genitalia via communication technology to Ms. C, a person he believed to \nbe 14 years old, but had not attained the age of 16 years. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. The criminal offense is \nnot recent. Almost six years have elapsed without evidence of recurrence of criminal \nactivity. He received job training and counseling; he obtained higher education by working \non information technology certifications; and he has an excellent employment record. \nAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, I conclude there is \nsubstantial reliable evidence of record that in December 2016, Applicant committed the \noffense of attempting to commit a lewd act upon a child by intentionally exposing his \ngenitalia via communication technology to Ms. C, a person he believed to be 14 years \nold, but had not attained the age of 16 years. At some point during his communications \nwith Ms. C, he specifically intended to commit a lewd act upon a child, Ms. C.   \nApplicant\u2019s claims that he did not intend to commit a lewd act upon Ms. C are not \ncredible. The offense itself shows a serious lapse of judgment. In addition, his comments \nat his hearing about his lack of intent to engage in a sex act with Ms. C in December 2016 \nwere not credible and raise questions about his rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 20-01577 \nat 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) (listing the purposes for which non-alleged conduct can be considered)). \nWhile his offense in December 2016, is not recent, there is insufficient proof of \nrehabilitation, and he did not accept fully responsibility for his offense. The totality of \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern arising from sexual behavior as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nIn December 2016, Applicant attempted to engage in a sex act with Ms. C, a \nperson he believed was 14 years old. He communicated lewd language to her about \nengaging in sex acts with him. He sent her a picture of his genitalia after she advised him \nshe was 14 years old. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d) are established. AG \u00b6 13(c) applies because \nat the time of the offense, he did not want his family, employer, and security officials to \nbe aware of his criminal sexual behavior. AG \u00b6 13(b) does not apply because Applicant \nis able to control his sexual behavior. \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of\ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and\nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a\nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating\nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating information and AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), \nand 14(e) partially apply. His attempted sex act with a 14-year-old occurred in \nDecember 2016, occurred on a single occasion, and is thus, infrequent. There is \nno evidence that he has sought sex from minors before or after December 2016, \nand the offense is not recent. He received some counseling, and a mental-health \npractitioner advised him that he was not diagnosed with pedophilia, which is \nevidence he would not commit future sexual offenses. However, he did not provide \na letter from his treating therapist indicating a positive diagnosis or prognosis.  \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. As indicated in the \nCriminal Conduct section, supra, Applicant was equivocal at his hearing about his \nmental state when he committed the offense, and this shows a lack of full \nrehabilitation. His sexual offense in December 2016, and his claim at his hearing \nthat he did not intend to complete the sex act with Ms. C continue to cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Sexual behavior security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) provide: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes but \nis not limited to consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a\nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct\nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \n \n \nApplicant engaged in criminal sexual conduct in December 2016 which is sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under Guideline J. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s spouse, in-laws, employer, law enforcement, and security \nofficials are aware of his history of criminal activity. AG \u00b6 16(e) is not established. The \nSOR under Guideline E indicates that the Air Force administratively discharged him for \nthe criminal conduct alleged under Guideline J, and this disposition information does not \nadd any disqualifying information. It is the underlying conduct, not the disposition \ninformation that raises security concerns. Personal conduct security concerns are \nduplications of security concerns addressed under other guidelines, and they are refuted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines D, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old functional information technology system administrator \nwho has been employed by a DOD contractor since January 2019. He has about 50 \ncollege credits, and he has not received a degree. He is studying for some technical \ncertifications. He served in the Air Force from 2000 to 2018, and he received a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions. When he left active duty he was a technical \nsergeant. He served in Iraq for four months in 2010. He received an Air Force \nAchievement Medal for his service in Iraq. \nApplicant provided statements from nine character witnesses. The general sense \nof the recommendations is that Applicant shows courtesy, professionalism, honesty, \nsincerity, trustworthiness, diligence, and reliability. He has a law-abiding character. His \ncharacter evidence letters support approval of his access to classified information. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more convincing. In December 2016, Applicant \nattempted to engage in a sex act with Ms. C, a person he believed was 14 years old. He \ncommunicated lewd language to her about engaging in sex acts with him. He sent her a \npicture of his genitalia after she advised him she was 14 years old. He received NJP for \nattempting to commit a lewd act upon a child, Ms. C, in violation of Article 80, UCMJ. At \nhis hearing, he falsely denied that he actually intended to engage in a sex act with a 14-\nyear-old girl. He is not accepting full responsibility for his criminal conduct. He is not fully \nrehabilitated. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Criminal \nconduct and sexual behavior security concerns are not mitigated. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are refuted. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On \nSeptember 23, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines J, E, and F.

On November 17, 2021, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be \nconducted by video teleconference on December 2, 2021. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until December 17, 2021, to \nenable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) \nA through U, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non December 10, 2021. The record closed on December 17, 2021. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of Articles 128 and \n134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the relevant portions of the Manual for \nCourts-Martial. Without objection from Applicant, I granted the request. (Tr. 12-14.) The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n2.a in part and 3.a-3.g, with explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 35-year-old manufacturing technician employed by defense \ncontractors since February 2014. He has held a security clearance since August 2004. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2016. He has been married since December 2009 \nand has an 11-year-old son and two stepchildren, ages 20 and 16, who live with him and \nhis wife. (Tr. 23.) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps while in high school and \nserved on active duty, including two tours of duty in a combat zone, from August 2004 to \nFebruary 2013, when he received a dishonorable discharge. (Tr. 26-27.) \nCriminal Conduct, cross-alleged as Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a). \nThe SOR alleges that an allegation of child physical abuse was substantiated \nagainst Applicant based on unexplained injuries inflicted on the child between August and \nDecember 2010 (SOR \u00b61.a). It also alleges that he was convicted by court-martial for \naggravated assault and child endangerment in December 2012 after his ten-month-old \nson suffered severe immersion burns in August 2011 while in his care (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nIn December 2010, Applicant and his wife took their infant son to a doctor for a \nscratched palate. Their son was two months old at the time. The doctor found no problem \nwith the palate but found signs of a fractured rib. Further examination found signs of a \nfractured clavicle and possible deformity of the distal femur. The doctor reported his \nfindings to the local civilian child protection service, who in turn reported them to the \nmilitary family advocacy program (FAP).

(GX 3 at 27-28.) \nApplicant claimed he did not know how his son\u2019s injuries could have occurred. His \nwife declined to be interviewed. Applicant was not sure whether his mother-in-law was \ninterviewed. (Tr. 41.) The FAP investigation could not determine who caused the injuries. \nThe baby was removed from the home and placed with Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law. The FAP \nClinical Counseling Service recommended multiple counseling programs, workshops, \nand support programs for Applicant and his wife if the allegations of child physical abuse \nwere confirmed. The Clinical Counseling Service determined that the risk of future abuse \nwas low and that the recommendation for the various programs was made to further \nreduce the level of risk. (GX 3 at 29.) The child was returned to the home in June 2011, \nwhen Applicant was reassigned to another location. The FAP at his new duty station \nreceived an email from the previous FAP stating that Applicant had completed his \ntreatment plan and the case was being closed. (GX 3 at 27.) The record does not reflect \nwhat his treatment plan required. The FAP at his new duty station closed the case without \nfurther action. (GX 3 at 2-3, 22.) \nIn August 2011, Applicant\u2019s son suffered severe scalding burns covering 35% of \nhis body while in a bathtub of hot water. Applicant had decided to bathe his son while his \nwife was taking a nap. He placed his son in the bathtub, turned on the water with his son \nsitting in the tub with his back to the faucet. He left the water run for a few minutes, \ntouched it about three times to check the temperature, and then stepped away for 30-45 \nseconds, facing away from his son, to retrieve soap from the vanity. He heard his son \nwhimper, and he turned around and saw his son on his back, screaming, squirming and \ntrying to get up. When he took his son out of the tub, the water was very hot, and the skin \non his son\u2019s back and arms was blistered. He immediately called 911 and reported that \nhis son had been burned and that his skin was peeling. (GX 3 at 21-22.) The NCIS \ndetermined that that the hot water temperature in Applicant\u2019s home was 145.9 degrees \ninstead of the customary 130 degrees. (GX 3 at 11.) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s son received skin grafts and was released from the hospital, he \nwas placed in the custody of Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law. A military protective order was \nissued, limiting Applicant\u2019s contact with his children. (GX 3 at 13.) Applicant was required \nto move into the barracks, where he remained until his court-martial in December 2012. \n(Tr. 41-43.) \nApplicant was charged with four specifications of assault consummated by a \nbattery on a child, in violation of Article 128, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 928, and five specifications of child endangerment by culpable negligence, in violation \nof Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S. C. \u00a7 934. He was tried by general court-martial in December \n2012. He was found not guilty of all four specifications of assault consummated by a \nbattery on a child and not guilty of four of the five specifications of child endangerment. \nHe was convicted of one specification of child endangerment by culpable negligence.

He testified that he and his wife received \u201ca lot of training or \ncounseling\u201d while their son was in the custody of his mother-in-law, but nothing after the \nfamily was reunited. (Tr. 42-43.) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $16,793. The debts \nalleged in the SOR are reflected in credit reports from December 2018 and February \n2020, as well as three credit reports from December 2021 submitted by Applicant after \nthe hearing (GX 3 and 4; AX S, T, and U.) \nApplicant was unemployed for about two months after being discharged in \nFebruary 2013. He worked at minimum-wage jobs as a cashier in a supermarket and in \na gas station from April 2013 to February 2014, when he was hired by his current \nemployer. (GX 1 at 12-14; Tr. 48.) He, his wife, his stepchildren, and his son all lived with \nhis mother-in-law, because they had no savings and could not afford to find a place to \nlive. (Tr. 52-53.) \nApplicant hired a law firm in February 2019 to negotiate with creditors and to \nremove incorrect information from his credit reports. (GX 2 at 12.) He provided copies of \ntwo letters prepared for him by his law firm and sent to one of the credit bureaus and 27 \nletters sent to the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c-3.g. The letters request verification of \nthe debts. All letters were sent before the SOR was issued. (AX F.) \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: collection account for $8,163. During a personal subject interview \n(PSI) in April 2019, Applicant told the investigator that he was unaware of this account \nwhen he submitted his SCA, and he did not know anything about it. (GX 2 at 9.) It was \nsold to a factoring company in August 2016. The original creditor is an on-line bank. (GX \n4 at 16.) In May 2019, July 2019, September 2019, and November 2019, Applicant sent \nletters to collection agency reflected in the December 2018 credit report (GX 4 at 16.) \ndisputing the validity of the debt. (AX F at 6, 13, 17, 23.) There is no evidence of a \nresponse to his letters, but the February 2020 credit report reflects that the debt is \ndisputed. (GX 5 at 2.) It is not resolved. (AX Q at 1; AX S at 36.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.b: credit-card account charged off for $3,892. During the PSI, \nApplicant told the investigator that he failed to disclose this debt in his SCA due an \noversight.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d The evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \"Honorable.\" \n \nAG \u00b6 31(e)\nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established. The incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b occurred more than ten years ago, with no recurrence. The incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b was the result of negligence by an inexperienced new father and not the product of \nanger or frustration. Applicant was reunited with his family after his discharge from the \nMarine Corps, and he is regarded by his mother-in-law and his pastor as a good father.  \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.

May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Although Applicant has made significant \nprogress in resolving his delinquent debts, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.c, and 3.d \nare not yet resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Marine Corps and \nsubsequent unemployment and underemployment were due to his culpable negligence. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant has received legal advice and \ncounseling from his law firm and has educated himself on financial management. \nHowever, the evidence falls short of \u201cclear indications\u201d that the problem is being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.e. It is not \nfully established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. However, a security clearance \nadjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nIt is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) \nApplicants are not held to a standard of perfection in their debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. All that is required is that applicants act responsibly given their \ncircumstances and \u201cdevelop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). Applicant has a plan, and he is \nsystematically carrying it out to the extent that his limited income permits. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant testified that he believed many of the \ndelinquent debts on his credit reports were erroneous, but he was unable to provide \ndocumentary proof to support his claims, in part because he is in the impossible position \nof having to prove a negative. His law firm appears to have used the common practice \namong credit-repair specialists of challenging every debt on the credit report whether or \nnot there is a documented basis for the challenge. On the other hand, it is clear that \nApplicant believed that some of the information was erroneous, simply because he could \nnot recognize some of the debts. \nThe fact that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.g no longer appear on a credit report \ndoes not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. \nDebts may fall off credit reports for various reasons, including the passage of time. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). The debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.g are not old enough to \u201cage off\u201d his credit report under the Fair Credit \nReporting Act. Thus, their absence strongly suggests that either the dispute was resolved \nin his favor or that the creditor abandoned the claim. However, the fact that a creditor is \nno longer actively seeking payment or that a debt is not otherwise collectable does not \nestablish that the debt has been resolved within the meaning of the Directive. ISCR Case \nNo. 10-03656 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011). \nAfter considering all the mitigating evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s resolution \nof the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.e and his systematic approach to resolving his \nother delinquent debts within the limits of his income are sufficient to mitigate the security \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns under this guideline. I am confident that he understands that failure to fully \nresolve his financial problems may result in reconsideration of his suitability to hold a \nsecurity clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant served on active duty in the Marine \nCorps for more than eight years, including two tours of duty in a combat zone. He was \ncandid, very remorseful, and credible at the hearing. His demeanor eloquently reflected \nhis anguish and remorse for the harm he had caused to his son. He was emotional and \nuncomfortable when he testified about the August 2011 incident. His demeanor is \nreflected in the transcript by Department Counsel\u2019s admonition, \u201cI know this is hard for \nyou . . . but I have got to go through these by virtue of the fact that they\u2019re on the Statement \nof Reasons.\u201d (Tr. 39.) \nApplicant is devoted to \u201cmaking it up\u201d to his son for his culpable negligence. He is \nconsidered by his pastor as a role model for his son. His reputation in the workplace is \nstellar and reflected in his numerous awards exceptional performance. \nA security clearance adjudication is not intended to punish past criminal conduct, \nbut rather to determine whether an applicant has the reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment required to protect classified information. Applicant has been punished for his \ncriminal conduct, and he has learned from his experience and demonstrated his suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, E, \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, personal \nconduct, and delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old and married with two children. He received a doctorate \ndegree in 1997. He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment as a senior executive with a defense contractor he \nfounded. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. Two at 26-29, 32.) \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nSOR allegations 1.a, and 1.b concern Applicant\u2019s in-laws, who are dual citizens \nof Taiwan and Canada. \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. His wife is also a native-born \nAmerican citizen. Her family lived in the United States, Canada, and Taiwan when she \nwas young. She returned to the United States in 1998, at the age of 17, to attend \ncollege. She has lived in the United States ever since. They were married in 2012 and \nhave two native-born children. She works for her husband\u2019s company. One of her duties \nis as the facility security officer (FSO). (Tr. Two at 26, 31-32.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of Taiwan and Canada, \nand reside in Taiwan. Neither of his in-laws have any connection to the Taiwanese or \nChinese governments. (Tr. One at 60, 62; Tr. Two at 39-42.) \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has been estranged from her mother for many years. The \nreason is unknown, but appears to center around her choice of Applicant as her \nhusband. She stated, \u201cMy mother, the relationship is pretty much non-existent from her \nside. It\u2019s very binary. After I got married, she stopped talking to me pretty much unless \nshe has to because there are other people there.\u201d  Applicant last saw his mother-in-law \nin 2018 in Taiwan in connection with his brother-in-law\u2019s wedding.

And she\u2019ll be basically \nacting as the hostess, and she would treat us with the courtesy one would \ngive a guest that you don\u2019t know.  (Tr. Two 40-41.) (See Tr.

Applicant has no \nownership interest in the company and cannot inherit any interest in it because he is not \nTaiwanese. The company does no business with the Taiwanese or Chinese \ngovernments. He has never received any financial benefit from the company. (Tr. One \nat 60-61; Tr. Two at 42, 44-45.) \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relationship with her father, she testified that \nit was growing more distant over the years. She stated, \u201cAnd, then, with my father, it\u2019s \nbetter. We still talk to each other on the phone. It was more frequent when I was in \nschool. It was pretty much weekly. Now, it\u2019s not so much. My life is busy, his life is busy. \nSo, if we\u2019re lucky, maybe every other week, we call and chitchat.\u201d She last saw her \nfather in 2019 in her state of residence when he was there on a business trip. (Tr. One \nat 63-65.) \nApplicant stated that he liked his father-in-law, but their interactions are very \nlimited, due to the actions of the mother-in-law. Also, there is a severe language barrier \nas Applicant does not speak Chinese and his father-in-law knows very little English. (Tr. \nTwo at 40.) \nApplicant has two brothers-in-law. The older brother-in-law was born in the \nUnited States and resides here. He submitted a statement in support of Applicant. \nHowever, he admits in that statement, \u201cMy relationship with [Applicant] is more distant \nthan my relationship with [Applicant\u2019s spouse]. We only speak when [Applicant\u2019s \nspouse] is also involved. I understand [Applicant] and my father communicate \noccasionally, but their conversations are limited, at least partially because my father \ndoes not speak much English.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit G.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s other brother-in-law is a citizen of Taiwan and Canada. He is a \nPermanent Legal Resident of the United States and has resided in the United States for \nover 20 years. Applicant has little contact with this brother-in-law, which the brother-in-\nlaw confirmed in his testimony in the spouse\u2019s case 20-01739. He testified about his \nrelationship with Applicant as follows, \u201cI view him [Applicant] as her husband, and I don\u2019t \ngo out of my way to talk to him. There is no reason for me to talk to him.\u201d He also stated \nthat the last time he spoke to Applicant was in 2017. (Tr. One at 30.) \nApplicant testified about his relationship with this brother-in-law, stating it is, \n\u201cNon-existent. Again, we don\u2019t talk on the phone. There is no animosity, but there is no \nrelationship.\u201d (Tr. 41.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR allegations 1.c through 1.j involve Applicant\u2019s foreign financial connections. \nSeveral general statements are applicable to these particular allegations. First, \nApplicant and his spouse confirmed that she has no ownership interest in any of the \nforeign financial accounts and investments of Applicant. Second, these investment \nvehicles and bank accounts are used by Applicant to diversify his portfolio, a common \ninvestment strategy. As further described below, with the exception of a small bank \naccount in China, all of his foreign bank accounts and other financial interests are in \nnations that are friendly to the United States, or allies of the United States. Finally, \nApplicant has consistently reported to the Federal Government the existence of his \nforeign bank accounts and the amounts in them. (Answer at pages 4-5; Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 20A, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. One at 77; Tr. \nTwo at 54-55, 58-63.) \nAs stated, Applicant started a closely-held corporation (The Company) in 1998 \nwhen he was 30 years old. Applicant\u2019s spouse has no ownership interest in The \nCompany. Applicant has been a very successful scientist and entrepreneur since he \nbegan The Company. His net worth in the United States is between 35 and 40 million \ndollars. He supplied extensive documentary evidence to support that statement. \n(Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. One at 44-47; Tr. Two at 34-36, 63-66.) \nWith that background, we move to a discussion of the specific allegations. \n1.c. Applicant purchased property in Taiwan. He subsequently built on that \nlocation with an expectation of creating some kind of hospitality business. Those plans \nhave not come to fruition. The building is vacant and Applicant has no current plans to \nfinish the building or have it occupied. He believes the property and building to be worth \napproximately $1,000,000. He owes about $400,000 on the property. This property is \npart of his diversification investment strategy. (Tr. One at 71-76; Tr. Two at 46-50.) \nWith regard to the specific bank accounts described below, the figures in them \nare derived from the most recent Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports (FBAR), \nwhich are for 2020. Applicant stated that the bank accounts have been funded from his \npersonal savings. The FBARs also confirm that he is the individual account holder on all \nof them. Finally, a review of earlier FBARs reveals that the accounts are static holdings. \nIn other words, there has been no appreciable increase in the amounts held in the \nvarious bank accounts. Applicant further stated that with the exception of the company \nin Taiwan described in SOR allegation 1.j, below, he has no plans to do business in any \nother foreign country. (Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. Two at 61-62.) \n1.d. Applicant has two bank accounts in Foreign Country (FC) A. Their combined \nvalue in 2020 was $713,278. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70-71.) \n1.e. Applicant has one bank account in FC B. The value of this account in 2020 \nwas $495,127. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.) \n1.f. Applicant has one bank account in FC C.

Applicant has one bank account in China. The value of this account in 2020 \nwas $77. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. 57-58.) \nThe total value of Applicant\u2019s foreign bank accounts is $1,331,677. When one \nincludes the property and building, his foreign holdings amount to about $2,000,000. \nThis figure is approximately 7% of his stateside net worth, which is estimated between \n35 and 40 million dollars. (Tr. Two at 66-67.) \n1.j. Applicant established a company in Taiwan in approximately 2014. This \ncompany has no assets and does no business. Applicant established the company with \nthe hope that it might improve relations with his in-laws. It did not succeed in doing so \nand has no current value. (Tr. One at 75-76; Tr. Two at 43-46, 68-71.) \nApplicant stated that he does not rely on any of the foreign accounts or \ninvestments to cover any of his daily living, personal or family expenses. He has an \nannual income in the United States of between $200,000 and $600,000. He testified \nthat the possible loss of the foreign bank accounts would have minimal impact on his \nday-to-day life. (Tr. Two at 30, 59-60, 67.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a written statement from a counterintelligence (CI) agent for \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Service. He has worked with the \nApplicant since 2017 in his role as founder of The Company. \nThe CI agent stated in Applicant Exhibit E: \nAt my request, [Applicant] has offered himself as a subject matter expert \nregarding a variety of subjects he is well versed in. Anytime [Applicant] \nhas a question regarding counterintelligence issues, he reaches out to me \nfor advice and assistance regarding how to handle the situation. \n[Applicant] has been one of the best reporters of suspicious information in \n[the state where The Company is located]. \nThe agent\u2019s statement goes on: \nEspecially given my position, I appreciate and respect the seriousness \nand gravity of the security clearance application process. While my \ninteraction with [Applicant] has been limited as described above, it is my \nopinion [Applicant] has been open and honest in his interactions with me. . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.. I often use [Applicant\u2019s] dedication to reporting CI concerns as an \nexample of what a superior CI awareness program looks like and \nencourage other companies to do the same. \nApplicant testified that he would contact the CI Agent if there were any questions \nor concerns about foreign contacts. (Tr. Two at 36-38.) \nA business associate and friend of Applicant testified on his behalf and provided \na written statement. The witness is currently a senior intelligence analyst working for the \nscientific and technical intelligence branch of an American armed force intelligence \nactivity. He has known Applicant for over twenty years on a personal and professional \nbasis. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 17-24.) \nThe witness stated in Applicant Exhibit C: \nBased on my interactions with [Applicant], I believe he is someone with a \nstrong moral compass who is loyal to our country. . .. in my opinion, \n[Applicant] is deserving of trust and he would be a valuable asset in \ncontinuing to support our classified national defense work. In my many \nyears of professional and personal interaction with [Applicant], I have no \nreason to doubt his patriotism or commitment to national defense. \nAs an individual operating in the national security space for more than \nthree decades, I appreciate and respect the seriousness and gravity of the \nsecurity clearance application process. Because of my respect for that \nprocess, I can confidently lend my support to [Applicant\u2019s] application to \nbe granted a security clearance as clearly consistent with the nation\u2019s \ninterests.  \nTaiwan \nApplicant has contacts with Taiwan. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at the \ncurrent situation concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is a multiparty democracy; whose \nauthorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Taiwan is an active \ncollector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the \nadministrative notice documents in the record. However, the record does not \ndemonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to \ncollect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth \nnoting that the U.S. Government, and the Defense Department in particular, have a \nclose and continuing relationship with Taiwan and its military, in accordance with the \nTaiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic \nrelations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, \u201cThe \nDepartment of Defense remains steadfastly committed to working with Taiwan to \nprovide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense \nconsistent with our obligation set out in our Taiwan Relations Act. We oppose all \nunilateral efforts to alter the status quo, and will continue to insist any resolution of \ndifferences accord with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(Department of Defense, Remarks by Secretary Mattis at Plenary Session of the     \n2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/ \nArticle/1538599/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-plenary-session-of-the-2018-shangri-la-\ndialogue/ (June 2, 2018).) \nChina \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference. China is a \nlarge and economically powerful country, with a population of more than billion people \nand an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian \ngovernment, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor record with \nrespect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and engages in arbitrary arrests \nand detentions, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China is one \nof the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected U.S. technology \nand economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering \nprograms, both legal and illegal. As a result, it is a growing threat to U.S. national \nsecurity. In addition, China views Taiwan as part of China. China has engaged in many \ndifferent coercive diplomatic and military activities, seeking to isolate and intimidate \nTaiwan into unification on China\u2019s terms. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are arguably applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law live in Taiwan. They are citizens of Taiwan and \nCanada. He also has a brother-in-law who is a citizen of Taiwan and Canada and lives \nin the United States. \nApplicant has a considerable amount of money deposited in several foreign \nbanks. The amount of money he has deposited overseas is $1,331,677. In addition, he \nhas approximately $600,000 in equity in the building he owns in Taiwan. However, only \nthe financial connections to Taiwan and China implicate AG \u00b6 7(f), since the other \naccounts are located in countries that are allies or friendly to the United States. All of \nthe above disqualifying conditions have application to this case. \nTaiwan is an active collector of industrial espionage. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. In addition, though not specifically alleged, I have \nconsidered China\u2019s activities and attitude with regard to Taiwan and the United States. \n(See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in\u00ad\nlaw live in Taiwan. In addition, one brother-in-law, who is a citizen of Taiwan and \nCanada, is a long-time resident of the United States. In this particular case, I find that \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance arising from these facts for the \nfollowing reasons. Due to his wife\u2019s family issues, she and Applicant have minimal \ncontact with her parents and her brothers. Applicant has virtually no relationship with his \nmother-in-law. His relationship with his wife\u2019s father is better, but is still distant, and \nneither speaks the other\u2019s language. Applicant is a native-born American citizen, who \nhas lived in the United States almost all his life. He obtained his advanced education \nhere. Applicant\u2019s family, consisting of his wife and two children, live in the United States. \nHe is an extremely successful and wealthy entrepreneur, who started his own company \nwhen young and still owns it. As further described, Applicant has substantial financial \ninterests in the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to influence him. As the founder \nand chief scientist for The Company he has a long history of working with CI agents of \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Service. I have particularly considered the \nstatement of the agent who works with Applicant. His positive remarks about Applicant\u2019s \nproactive approach in reporting potential CI issues is compelling evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nAs stated, Applicant is a very wealthy man. He has substantial holdings in the \nUnited States, worth between 35 and 40 million dollars. He also made the decision to \nengage in diversification of his assets by depositing sums in foreign financial \ninstitutions. With the addition of the equity in the empty building in Taiwan, his foreign \nassets amount to only about 7% of his American-based wealth. Though the amounts \nare large, compelling evidence was shown that Applicant\u2019s financial activities overseas \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave been routine. Applicant and his spouse both testified that losing any or all of the \nforeign accounts would have minimal effect on them, given their substantial income and \nassets in the United States. \nApplicant has completely mitigated the security significance of his connections to \nTaiwan, as well as his foreign financial connections. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment. Applicant has shown \nhimself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense \nindustry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates due to his sense of loyalty and deep personal connections to the United States, \nthe land of his birth. There is very minimal, if any, potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn November 20, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec.

(HE \n2) On April 7, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) \nOn August 25, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.    \nOn September 17, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On November 12, 2021, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for December 16, 2021. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nAs part of his SOR response, Applicant provided nine exhibits. (Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A-AE I) At hearing, Applicant offered his SOR response, including the nine SOR \nexhibits; Applicant added a document to AE A, and an additional exhibit, AE J. (Transcript \n(Tr.) 7-9, 18-20, 22-23; GE 1-9; AE A-I) Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; \nhowever, Applicant objected to GE 7, a JPAS incident report, and GE 8, a DISS/CATS \nincident report, because they are cumulative. (Tr. 20) GE 7 and GE 8 were admitted; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s comments are accepted for the weight the exhibits are accorded. \n(Tr. 21) Moreover, other documents admitted are better evidence than GE 7 and GE 8, \nsuch as Applicant\u2019s charge sheet and result of trial documentation. Applicant objected to \nGE 9, an Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview, because it was \noffered without a sponsoring witness. (Tr. 20) Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 9 was \nsustained. (Tr. 21) There were no additional objections; and all proffered exhibits, except \nfor GE 9, were admitted into evidence.

(Tr. 32-33; HE 3 at 3; AE D) He served his country in \ncombat and went on exceptionally dangerous capture or kill missions. (Tr. 32-33; AE C) \nHe had friends who were killed or injured in combat. (Tr. 33) He was a multi-purpose K9 \nhandler, which included searching for improvised explosive devices (IED), other enemy \nmunitions, and enemy weapons. (Tr. 34) More information about his military background \nis included in the Character Evidence section, infra. \nApplicant\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating is 90 percent, \nwhich includes disability for damage to various joints, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 50 \npercent for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (Tr. 57-59, 142) He had service-related \ninjuries to his hand and foot. (HE 3 at 3) He is seeking an increase in his disability rating \nto 100 percent. (Tr. 142) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nAlleged Theft, Importation, and Possession of Army and Foreign Munitions \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. SOR \u00b6 1.a \nalleges that Applicant was charged with the following criminal offenses: disobedience of \na lawful general order, in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); \nfailure to provide notice and turn over abandoned property, in violation of Article 103, \nUCMJ; possession of unregistered firearms and explosives, in violation of Article 134, \nUCMJ; and larceny, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ. In January 2016, he was sentenced \nat a BCD-SPCM to be confined for 12 months and to reduction to specialist (E-4). \nThe conduct that formed the basis for the charges began during Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent tour in Afghanistan in 2014. For about three months while Applicant was deployed \nto Afghanistan, he gathered munitions. (Tr. 139-140) Munitions are defined as military \nequipment, which includes firearms, ammunitions, and explosives. He did not describe \nhow he obtained the munitions and whether he falsified any inventory, disposition, or turn-\nin documents. During this deployment, he said he told an SF colonel about having \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmunitions and wanting to bring the ordnance back to the United States to use for training \nof K9 teams. (Tr. 41, 95-97) He said he wanted munitions that were similar to enemy \nmunitions encountered in Afghanistan for more realistic training. (HE 3 at 6, 11) The SF \ncolonel told him it would involve too much paperwork, hassle, or effort to obtain approval. \n(Tr. 41-43, 97) The SF colonel did not specifically say no to Applicant\u2019s suggestion about \nimportation of explosives from Afghanistan into the United States. (Tr. 98) Applicant did \nnot provide the name or contact information for the SF colonel. Applicant denied that he \nreceived a direct order not to bring the ordnance to the United States. (Tr. 43) He decided \nto \u201cimprovise\u201d to accomplish this self-identified training mission. (Tr. 42) He rationalized \nthat he could not accept no for an answer when he might be able to save lives by taking \nthe actions that he took. (Tr. 42) No one ever gave him permission to bring munitions \nfrom Afghanistan to the United States. (Tr. 83) The only enemy munitions identified were \ntwo PG-7VM, which are fired from a rocket propelled grenade (RPG)-7 launcher, and an \nAK-47. See The Specification of Charge II, and the Specification of Charge IV, infra.  \nHowever, it is likely that the enemy in Afghanistan uses stolen U.S. munitions and PG-\n7VMs for IEDs and other nefarious purposes. \nApplicant put the munitions he gathered in Afghanistan in an ISU-60 Army \ncontainer along with K9 and other tactical equipment. (Tr. 88, 140) The ISU-60 was \ntransported from Applicant\u2019s tactical location, to Bagram Air Base, and eventually to an \nArmy canine facility in an installation in the United States. (Tr. 140-141) He did not indicate \nhe warned the shipping entities (aircraft or ship), the Army, or customs that he had stored \nexplosives or munitions in the container. \nApplicant gathered more than 2,000 rounds of 5.56 millimeter ammunition in \nAfghanistan to bring to the United States. (Tr. 89) He brought the ammunition to the \nUnited States in ammunition cans in the ISU-60. (Tr. 89, 140-141) He said that there was \ntoo much \u201cred tape and bureaucracy\u201d in getting ammunition on the military installation, \nand he believed he could improve the survivability of his team by avoiding the \nbureaucracy in training involved in getting ammunition authorizations. (Tr. 91-92) He said \nthat in 2014 he was focused on saving lives through realistic training. (Tr. 91-94) He did \nnot provide any statements from anyone that 5.56 millimeter ammunition was unavailable \nfor SF training at the installation where he was assigned. \nAmmunition is accountable in the United States at U.S. Army ranges. (Tr. 116) \nSoldiers are not permitted to retain unused ammunition when leaving the range. (Tr. 116) \nOverseas unused ammunition is supposed to be transferred to the replacement unit when \na unit rotates back to the United States. (Tr. 116) There was no information presented \nthat the unit that replaced Applicant\u2019s unit suffered any mission decrement due to the \nmissing munitions that Applicant took and exported to the United States from Afghanistan. \nIn November 2014, Applicant returned to the United States from Afghanistan, and \nhe brought some live ordnance or munitions from overseas into the United States. (Tr. \n37-38, 83) He wanted to train dogs with actual munitions because he believed that \ndevices used for training in the United States had a different odor. (Tr. 38) He suggested \nuse of ordnance from Afghanistan in K9 training would reduce or eliminate in-country \nacclimation of the dogs. (Tr. 38) He brought explosives and ammunition to the United \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nStates to enhance a canine team\u2019s survivability. (Tr. 38) However, some of the items he \nbrought were souvenirs that he took to remind him of an operation or mission. (Tr. 38) He \nsaid he had U.S. and enemy ordnance at his house to use for training because dogs need \nto recognize the difference between friendly and enemy munitions. (Tr. 39) He said he \nplanned to take the ordnance to his base for training. (Tr. 40) He denied that the ordnance \nwas for his own personal use or gain. (Tr. 41) Whatever he did not use for training, he \nintended to \u201corganize a big cache and then blow it in place\u201d on the military installation. \n(Tr. 95) He never said he intended to return the U.S. Army military property he imported \nfrom Afghanistan into the United States to Army official supply channels. \nApplicant transported the munitions that he obtained in Afghanistan from the \nmilitary installation to his off-post residence in his privately-owned vehicle. (Tr. 84-85) He \nnever moved the munitions from his off-post residence. (Tr. 85) He never used the \nmunitions for training. (Tr. 85) The munitions were stored in unlocked boxes in his off-\npost residence; however, they were in a room with a locked door. (Tr. 86) There is no \nevidence that he attempted to sell the munitions to others. \nIn late November 2014 while Applicant was on leave away from his home, there \nwas a break-in of his off-post residence. (Tr. 139; HE 3 at 6) The burglar left a door \npartially open, and a neighbor called the police. (Tr. 139) The law enforcement officials \nwho entered his off-post residence informed the Army of the ordnance in Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. Some of Applicant\u2019s personal firearms were stolen in the burglary; however, \nhe said none of the munitions that he brought from Afghanistan were stolen. (Tr. 138-\n139) \nIn July 2015, the following four charges and four specifications were referred to a \nBCD-SPCM. On October 16, 2015, Applicant and his counsel submitted a pretrial \nagreement in which they offered to plead guilty to the Specifications of Charges I, II, and \nIV, and Charges I, II, and IV, in return for referral to a BCD-SPCM, to accept the \namendments to other charges and specifications, and to dismiss the larceny of military \nproperty charge. (GE 4 at 17-19) The offer to plead guilty included a promise to complete \na stipulation of the facts supporting the guilty plea. The parties did not provide a stipulation \nof fact for inclusion in the security clearance record. (Tr. 142) The convening authority \naccepted the offer to plead guilty. \nIn the Specification of Charge I, and Charge I, Applicant pleaded guilty to \nwrongfully possessing and exporting one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1 \nClaymore Antipersonnel Mines; four blocks of C4 Demolition Charges; 17 M81 Igniter \nTime Blasting Fuses; five M67 fragmentary hand grenades; eight rounds of 40 millimeter \nlow velocity High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP); detonation cord; three thermobaric \ngrenades; six blasting caps; M15 Modernized Demolition Initiators (MDI); M11 \nModernized Demolition Initiators; one Dual In-Line initiator blasting cap; and C3 \ndemolition charge datasheet. In addition to these items of U.S. military ordnance, he was \nalso charged with items of non-U.S. military property, including an AK-47 assault rifle and \none British fragmentation grenade. (GE 4 at 9-10, 12, 17). The maximum possible \nconfinement for a violation of Article 92, UCMJ includes years of confinement. See MCM, \n2012 ed., \u00b6 16e(1)).

(Tr. 88) \nWhile he was deployed to Afghanistan, Applicant was entrusted with his SF team\u2019s \nproperty. (Tr. 135; HE 3 at 3)      \nApplicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge II, and Charge II, failure to \nreport and turn over captured or abandoned property, to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two \nPG-7VM, one RPG launcher, of a value greater than $500, in violation of Article 103, \nUCMJ (maximum sentence includes five years of confinement, see MCM, 2012 ed., \u00b6 \n27e(1)(b)); \nThe Specification of Charge III and Charge III were referred to trial; however, they \nwere dismissed pursuant to a pretrial agreement. They allege larceny of military property \nof a value of more than $500, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ (maximum sentence \nincludes 10 years of confinement, see MCM, 2012 ed., \u00b6 46e(1)(c)). Applicant was \ncharged with stealing the following items of U.S. Army military property from Bagram Base \nin Afghanistan on or about October 2014: 2,088 rounds of 5.56 millimeter ammunition; \n491 rounds of 7.62 millimeter long range ammunition; 263 rounds of 9 millimeter \nammunition; one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel \nMines; four blocks of C4 Demolition Charges; 23 M81 Igniter Time Blasting Fuses; five \nM67 fragmentary hand grenades; eight rounds of 40 millimeter low velocity High \nExplosive Dual Purpose (HEDP); 18 demolition blocks of \u00bc lb.

(GE 4 at 9, 14) He said he was not guilty of the larceny offense. (Tr. \n43). \nApplicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge IV and Charge IV, wrongful \npossession of unlawful firearms, to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two PG-7VMs, and one \nrocket propelled grenade launcher, in violation of Article 134, UCMJ and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n5861(d) (Section 5861(d) states, \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person--(d) to receive or \npossess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and \nTransfer Record\u201d). (GE 4 at 9-10; HE 3 at 7)   \nApplicant providently pleaded guilty in accordance with his pretrial agreement; the \nlarceny charge was dismissed; a military judge sentenced him to 12 months of \nconfinement; and with good behavior, he served almost 10 months of confinement. (Tr. \n45; HE 3 at 7) Applicant\u2019s father died while he was in confinement. (Tr. 44) Applicant said \nhe took responsibility for and pleaded guilty to the offenses he committed. (Tr. 77) \nApplicant believed his offenses were not felonies. (Tr. 144-145) \nApplicant disclosed the criminal offenses on his March 15, 2018 SCA. He admitted \nthat he made the wrong choices in his manner of handling munitions, and he said he had \nno excuses or justifications for his actions. (Tr. 92-93) He promised to be detail oriented \nand strictly follow protocols and rules in the future.

(Tr. \n65) He promised that he would not have any transgressions in the future. (Tr. 67)  \nApplicant inherited or purchased several rifles and guns. (Tr. 99) He denied that \nhe was a collector of firearms or ammunition. (Tr. 100, 132) For example, he purchased \na Walter P38 Nazi relic, a World War II Luger pistol, and a Valmet fold stock 5.56, which \nis an AK-style rifle. (Tr. 100-101) He currently owns seven to ten firearms. (Tr. 136) In \n2017, he spent about $12,000 to purchase two firearms. (Tr. 136) He is currently storing \nthe firearms he purchased. (Tr. 136) He purchased these items as investments. (Tr. 101) \nNone of the firearms he currently owns fires a 5.56 milliliter round; however, in November \n2014, he owned an AR-15, which fires a 5.56 milliliter round. (Tr. 137) The AR-15 was \nstolen in the burglary of his residence in November 2014. (Tr. 137) \nAlleged Theft of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Family Separation \nAllowance \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that in January 2015, Applicant was referred for disciplinary \naction for violation of Article 121, UCMJ, for receiving Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) \nat the with dependent rate for failing to update his records to indicate he was divorced in \n2012. There was probable cause to believe he fraudulently submitted a document for \nfamily separation allowance (FSA) for his deployment in 2014. He did not receive any \ndisciplinary action because of his pending court-martial as indicated in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant was married from 2007 to January 2012. (Tr. 35, 103) He believed his \nwife was upset with him because he dedicated his life to being a successful Soldier. (Tr. \n36) His wife wanted to be his top priority, and he advised her that he was giving his career \nand the Army top priority. (Tr. 36) Applicant believed his decision to give such a high \npriority to Army SF caused or contributed to the end of his marriage. (Tr. 35-36)  \n \nApplicant said he provided his divorce decree to the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service (DFAS), and he completed the documentation to change his BAH \nafter his divorce from with dependent to single; however, DFAS continued to pay him BAH \nat the married or with dependent rate. (Tr. 46, 130; HE 3 at 9) He contacted DFAS three \nor four times in the next two months after his divorce, and he asked DFAS to stop paying \nhim at the with dependents rate. (Tr. 46, 102) He was focused on being a good Soldier \nand completion of his SF missions, and he concluded DFAS would eventually correct \ntheir mistake. (Tr. 47, 131) The local DFAS office was notorious for being understaffed \nand inefficient. (Tr. 47) There is no evidence that he asked his chain of command or the \nInspector General for assistance in getting DFAS to correct his BAH payments. He was \nnot confronted with the overpayment until he returned from Afghanistan in November \n2014. (Tr. 132) He did not provide copies of any correspondence sent to DFAS to correct \nthe BAH overpayment. \nApplicant received a BAH overpayment of about $15,000.

(HE 3 at 10; AE \nJ) The DD Form 1561 indicates his deployment began on April 4, 2014, and he was \u201cnot \ndivorced or legally separated from [his] spouse.\u201d (AE J) On May 12, 2014, a logistics \nbranch lieutenant colonel, commanding, signed the DD Form 1561 (not an SF \ncommander). (AE J) Applicant said he was re-deployed to Afghanistan in April 2014. (Tr. \n48) He denied that he filled out or signed the DD Form 1561, and he noted his first name \nwas not spelled correctly on the DD Form 1561. (Tr. 50-51, 128; HE 3 at 10) He was \nnever charged with submitting a fraudulent DD Form 1561 or BAH fraud. (Tr. 52) He \ndenied that he had ever stolen from his country. (Tr. 66) \nAn SF colonel and a former SF soldier described multiple problems with the same \nDFAS office that was supposed to process Applicant\u2019s BAH and FSA. (Tr. 109, 113-114, \n121-122) The DFAS office may have had difficulties because of the SF operational tempo \nand various special pays for SF soldiers. (Tr. 109-111) \nApplicant has good credit. (Tr. 53-55) A friend offered him employment at three to \nfour times his Army pay, and he decided to stay on active duty because he wanted to \ndeploy with his SF team. (Tr. 55-57, 122-123) \nCharacter Evidence \nAn SF colonel, who is currently a battalion commander, attended the SF \nqualifications course with Applicant in 2008, and they subsequently served together in the \nsame detachment. (Tr. 107, 113) He was aware of Applicant\u2019s court-martial; however, he \nstill believed that at his core, Applicant had good character. (Tr. 112) A friend described \nApplicant as a patriot who wanted to continue to contribute to the Department of Defense. \n(Tr. 124) Numerous written character statements laud his contributions to mission \naccomplishment while serving as an SF Soldier and Defense contractor. (AE A; AE B) \nThe general sense of Applicant\u2019s character statements is that he is patriotic, dedicated, \nreliable, diligent, brave, loyal, friendly, and professional. (AE A; AE B) Applicant is \nengaged in several charity endeavors. (HE 3 at 5) \nIn 2014, Applicant and his team were involved in a firefight in Afghanistan. \nApplicant repeatedly moved through enemy fire, and in the engagement, he entered a \nbuilding and killed three enemy combatants. His actions saved the lives of two Afghan \nSoldiers who were medically evacuated and other team members through his \nsuppressive fire upon enemy positions. He provided a \u201cNarrative to Accompany the \nAward\u201d and \u201cCitation to Accompany the Award\u201d for a Bronze Star with V device. (AE C) \nHowever, he did not provide the orders for the award or the recommendations for the \naward, which are usually detailed on a DD Form 638. \nApplicant initially said he was awarded two Bronze Stars, and an Army \nCommendation Medal (ARCOM) with V device.

(AE D) He successfully completed numerous \ntraining courses. (Id.) The narrative and citation Applicant submitted do not establish with \ncertainty that he was awarded a Bronze Star with V device. His DD Form 214 listing of \nmedals, awards, and badges is given greater weight than the narrative and citation he \nsubmitted and his claims that he received a Bronze Star with V device. See AE D. \nApplicant believes he has changed since November 2014, and is now a better \nperson. (Tr. 143) The \u201cdarkness and death\u201d of his combat experiences temporarily \nclouded his judgment. (Tr. 143) He loves the United States, and he promised to serve \nhonorably in the future.

The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) \nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply to the following criminal offenses: (1) The \nSpecification of Charge I and Charge I, failure to obey a lawful general order concerning \npossession of and exportation of munitions; (2) The Specification of Charge II and Charge \nII, failure to report and turn over captured or abandoned property, a firearm and \nexplosives, in violation of Article 103, UCMJ; (3) The Specification of Charge III and \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharge III, larceny of military property of a value of more than $500, in violation of Article \n121, UCMJ; (4) The Specification of Charge IV and Charge IV, wrongful possession of \nunlawful firearms, to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two PG-7VMs, one RPG launcher, in \nviolation of Article 134, UCMJ and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d); and (5) wrongful appropriation of \nBAH at the with dependents rate totaling about $15,000. \nApplicant admitted (1), (2), and (4) at his hearing or court-martial or both. As to (3), \nhe admitted that most of Army munitions that he gathered in Afghanistan were Army \nmilitary property. He arranged for the transportation of the munitions to Bagram Air Force \nBase, then to his installation in the United States, and then to his residence. He said he \nwas going to use the Army property for training; however, this use was not authorized by \nthe Army. Eventually, he planned to destroy the munitions; however, he did not indicate \nthis destruction would be authorized by the Army or through official Army channels. His \nintention not to return the Army munitions he took without authority to official Army \npossession or control constitutes an intention to permanently deprive the Army of the \nproperty, and the crime of larceny is established. \nAs to (5), Applicant knowingly retained and accumulated DFAS funds from the date \nof his divorce in January 2012 to DFAS\u2019s discovery of the overpayment. He knew he was \nnot entitled to the extra BAH payments after his divorce, and after a couple of months of \ntrying to correct the problem at DFAS, he did not take any further actions to return the \ngovernment\u2019s funds. As an SF noncommissioned officer with two bachelor\u2019s degrees, he \nis presumed to know that if DFAS failed to correct the overpayment after a few months, \nhis next steps should have been to contact the chain of command, Inspector General, or \nLegal Assistance for help. He did not take reasonable and timely steps to return the DFAS \noverpayment, and wrongful appropriation of DFAS funds is established. \nThe SOR allegations that Applicant committed larceny of BAH at the with \ndependents rate and FSA, and that he submitted a fraudulent DD Form 1561 to DFAS \nare refuted. Applicant knew that eventually DFAS would correct his pay records and \nobtain repayment of any overpayment, and therefore, he did not commit larceny from \nDFAS, as he did not have the intent to permanently deprive the government of funds. \nMoreover, Applicant credibly established that he is not a financially greedy person. As to \nthe generation of the false DD Form 1561, most likely the DD Form 1561 was generated \nas a shortcut on his behalf without his knowledge or consent by a well-meaning Army \nperson in the erroneous belief that he was entitled to the allowance. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. The offenses were committed during 2013 and 2014, \nand are not recent. He served his confinement and repaid the DFAS funds. He has \nlearned from his mistakes, and is unlikely to repeat these particular offenses. Applicant is \nnot financially greedy or avaricious. He is well educated, diligent, and successful in his \nemployment. He has constructive community involvement. \nThe evidence against full mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant committed four \nserious criminal offenses (the wrongful appropriation of DFAS funds is not a serious \noffense in comparison to the munitions-related offenses). He had an opportunity to \nterminate his criminal activity over the three months he was gathering munitions in \nAfghanistan with the intention of importing them into the United States. There is no \npersuasive evidence that he intended to return the munitions into the official Army supply \nsystem. His actions put the personnel who transported the explosives from Afghanistan \nto the United States and the civilian population in his neighborhood at risk of death or \nserious injury. The person or persons who burglarized his home could have stolen the \nexplosives and sold them to criminals. They could have used the explosives for their own \nnefarious purposes. While the chance of detonation of the munitions resulting in the death \nor injury is low, if they were accidently or deliberately detonated by untrained personnel, \nthe result could be devastating. \nApplicant is an intelligent person with an extensive background in munitions. He \nwas well-aware of the destructive power of various munitions. His handling of the \nmunitions in the charges constitutes serious misconduct. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the offenses under the UCMJ, Applicant\u2019s conduct involving firearms \nand munitions violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(3) (illegal importation of firearms), 922(a)(4) \n(illegal importation of destructive device), 922(e) (failure to give written notice to shipper \nof presence of explosives), 922(i) (knowing transport or shipment of stolen firearm or \nammunition), and possibly several other subsections in Title 18. \nThe SOR does not allege any violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 or discuss the risks of \ndeath or injury entailed with uncontrolled shipment or possession of munitions. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on criminal \noffenses, and all the facts and circumstances, I have continuing doubts about the risks \nthat Applicant will make poor decisions and show poor judgment in connection with \nsecurity and classified information. While there is no evidence of criminal conduct after \nNovember or December 2014, it is too soon to conclude poor decisions or compromise \nof classified information is unlikely to recur. Not enough time has elapsed without serious \npremeditated misconduct to eliminate doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe LOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply. As indicated in the previous section, \nGuideline J is the most appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s conduct. The Guideline J \ndiscussion indicates sufficient evidence for an adverse determination. AG \u00b6 16(e) does \nnot apply because his court-martial is publicly available. He disclosed his offenses on his \nSCA and discussed them at his hearing. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old lead weapons instructor, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since May 2020. He has not had any employment problems after leaving \nconfinement in October 2016. In 2006, Applicant received two bachelor\u2019s degrees. He \nserved on active duty in the Army from April 2007 to October 2016, and he received an \nhonorable discharge. He completed SF training in January 2009 and was awarded the \nGreen Beret. He is Ranger, HALO parachute, and diver qualified. He completed several \nadditional specialty training courses. \nApplicant was deployed to Pakistan for five months in 2011 and to Afghanistan for \n10 months from 2013 to 2014. He served his country in combat and went on exceptionally \ndangerous capture or kill missions. He had friends killed or injured in combat. He was a \nmulti-purpose K9 handler, which included searching for IEDs, enemy munitions, and \nenemy weapons. His VA disability rating is 90 percent, which includes disability for \ndamage to various joints, TBI, and 50 percent for PTSD. He had service-related injuries \nto his hand and foot. \nNumerous written character statements laud his contributions to mission \naccomplishment while serving as an SF Soldier and Defense contractor. The general \nsense of Applicant\u2019s character statements is that he is patriotic, dedicated, reliable, \ndiligent, brave, loyal, friendly, and professional. Applicant is engaged in several charity \nendeavors. \nIn 2014, Applicant and his team were involved in a firefight in Afghanistan. \nApplicant repeated moved through enemy fire, and in the engagement, he entered a \nbuilding and killed three enemy combatants. His actions saved the lives of two friendly \nSoldiers who were medically evacuated and other team members through his \nsuppressive fire upon enemy positions. He was nominated for a Bronze Star with V \ndevice. \n \nApplicant believes he has changed since November 2014, and he is now a better \nperson. The \u201cdarkness and death\u201d of his combat experiences temporarily clouded his \njudgment.

May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of service in a combat or hostile fire zone on behalf of \nthe United States: \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his [or her] ties \nand sense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR Case \nNo. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006). . . . See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. \n19, 2012). \nApplicant has a documented history of demonstrating courage and bravery under \nhostile fire. All these circumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, \nresist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to \ncoerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). I have \nno doubt that Applicant would not succumb to any pressure or coercion to compromise \nclassified information, and he would report any such attempts. \nApplicant has possessed firearms after his court-martial conviction. 18 U.S.C. \n922(g)(1) states, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person\u2014(1) who has been convicted in any \ncourt of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d Federal \ncircuit courts have found convictions by court-martial to be convictions in \u201cany court.\u201d \nUnited States v. Shaffer, 807 F.3d 943, 947 (8th Cir. 2015) (citing United States v. \nMacDonald, 992 F.2d 967, 969-70 (9th Cir. 1993)). See Holcombe v. United States, 2021 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 2409 (W.D. Tex. 2021) (discussing Air Force and DOD processes for \nentering qualifying court-martial convictions into federal databases to prevent purchase \nof firearms). The term \u201cpunishable\u201d refers to the maximum punishment and not the level \nof court. See United States v. Essig, 10 F.3d 968 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding maximum \npossible punishment of five years of confinement in misdemeanor-level of court \nconstituted predicate conviction under the federal statute regarding the purchase of \nfirearms, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, even though defendant sentenced to probation for two years).  \nArmy Regulation 27-10, Military Justice (Nov. 20, 2020), does not address \nqualifying court-martial convictions limiting possession of firearms under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. \nThe Navy post-trial processing guidelines require annotation on records for general \ncourts-martial, but not for SPCM convictions for offenses carrying a maximum punishment \nexceeding one year evidently because the jurisdictional maximum for a SPCM is one year \nof confinement. See JAG/CNLSC INST 5814.1D, Encl. 5, Post-Trial Gun Control Act of \n1968 Reporting Requirements (Sept. 6, 2019). For security clearance purposes, no \nadverse inference is drawn from Applicant\u2019s post-trial possession of firearms because his \nlevel of trial was a BCD-SPCM, which has a jurisdictional maximum limited to one year of \nconfinement. \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe factors weighing against continuation of his security clearance are more \nsubstantial than the mitigating circumstances. Applicant committed five criminal offenses. \nHis scheme to gather munitions, including an AK-47, grenades, mines, RPGs, and \nexplosives and to import them into the United States was knowing and premeditated. He \nrisked injury or death to shippers and civilians. Fortunately, the munitions were recovered \nbefore they were used, lost, stolen, or exploded. His theft of U.S. military property valued \nat over $500 is a serious crime, which carries a maximum confinement of 10 years if his \ncase were tried at a general court-martial, and larceny is a crimen falsi offense. His story \nabout intending to use the explosives to train military dogs in the identification of enemy \nexplosives is undercut by the absence of information about how he would use the mostly \nU.S. ordnance to conduct this training without being exposed to detection and \napprehension by military authorities.   \nOther SF personnel attending his training might ask where and how he obtained \nthe non-inert explosives or ammunition. If he told them that he stole the ammunition from \nthe Army in Afghanistan, then anyone who possessed the stolen ammunition would be in \njeopardy of prosecution for violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(j) for possession of stolen \nammunition. Any military personnel who knowingly received the Army property stolen \nfrom the Army in Afghanistan without reporting the receipt would risk punishment for \nreceiving stolen property, in violation of Article 134, UCMJ. His story about his plan to use \nthe stolen military property for training is not plausible. Credibility is essential for a security \nclearance holder. The DOD must be able to rely on the security clearance holder to report \nhis own security violation or the security violation of a colleague, even when disclosure \nmight damage someone\u2019s career. I have lingering doubts that Applicant would report a \nsecurity violation if he deemed the violation was done in good faith to complete the \nmission. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without criminal conduct and other conduct raising a serious concern, he \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are refuted; however, criminal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated at this time. \n17 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n Paragraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She worked as an LPN from 2013 to 2019, and still does part-time work in that field. She also works in software. She has worked for a DOD contractor since 2017.

(GE 1 at 49-51) Applicant testified that she has always been a salaried \u201cW-2\u201d employee. Her 2018 tax debt resulted from her status as an independent contractor, a \u201c1099\u201d employee, because she did not understand that as a \u201c1099\u201d independent contractor, she, rather than her employer, was responsible for withholding taxes from her pay.

She also has about $40,000 in past-due federal income tax debt. \nAlthough she filed her tax returns in January 2021, and the tax debt is due to an isolated \ncircumstance, her belated actions are not sufficient steps to address her tax debt. \nApplicant therefore did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial \ntrustworthiness concerns.

Processing of this case was delayed significantly by the COVID-19 \npandemic. The case was first assigned to another DOHA administrative judge on March \n16, 2022. On April 21, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing to be held \nin-person on May 18, 2022 at a location near where Applicant lives and works. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 10, 2022, after the initial administrative judge became \nunavailable. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9, which were all admitted without objection.

She timely \nsubmitted 11 documents, which I have grouped into Post-Hearing (PH) exhibits 1 \nthrough 6. They are all admitted without objection. Those documents are described in \nthe Facts section, below. DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 26, 2022. The \nrecord closed on June 8, 2022.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. She has a high school diploma and is trained as a \nlicensed practical nurse (LPN). She was married twice, and has four grown children. \nShe worked as an LPN from 2013 to 2019, and still does part-time work in that field. \nShe also works in software. She has worked for a DOD contractor since 2017. (GE 1; \nTr. 40) \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant disclosed unpaid taxes and unfiled tax returns for tax \nyears 2016 and 2017, and an older tax debt, from about 2010. (GE 1 at 49-51) \nApplicant testified that she has always been a salaried \u201cW-2\u201d employee. Her \n2018 tax debt resulted from her status as an independent contractor, a \u201c1099\u201d \nemployee, because she did not understand that as a \u201c1099\u201d independent contractor, \nshe, rather than her employer, was responsible for withholding taxes from her pay. (Tr. \n42-46) In 2018, she earned over $163,000 in taxable income but had little withheld. (GE \n7, AE C) \nApplicant usually requests a filing extension for her federal tax returns. She said \nshe started her job as a DOD contractor in September 2017. If she had filed for an \nextension, her 2016 federal taxes would have been due not in April 2017, but in October \n2017. She said she did not have an excuse for not filing, just overwork and travel. \nApplicant explained that her DOD job involved work in states located away from her \nhome, long days and working weekends. \nApplicant received an interrogatory from DOHA about her taxes in March 2020. \n(GE 2) She said she prepared and filed her federal tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, \nand 2018 some time afterwards, in 2020. She asserted that she did so while working on \nan assignment in another state, and that she returned home in fall 2020, after she was \npromoted. She said she prepares her tax forms herself, using well-known tax \npreparation software.

She now owes $40,291 in taxes, penalties, and interest. (GE 7; AE \nC) (SOR \u00b6 1.b)   \nApplicant does not have to pay state income taxes in her home state. She said \nshe filed her 2019 and 2020 federal returns with extensions. (Tr. 54-55) She filed her \n2021 tax returns the day before the hearing. She said she was due a refund of $1,233, \nan amount that will likely be recaptured to address her 2018 tax debt. (Tr. 35, 54-56, 66) \nApplicant\u2019s plan to address her $40,000 tax debt from 2018 is to refinance her \nhome and to use the equity in the home to address her taxes. She recently remodeled \nthe home, where she lives with her mother. She said she bought the home from her \nmother, and it has a $64,000 mortgage. (Tr. 86-88; AE D) At the time of the hearing, \nshe had no plan in place to address the debt. She said she had received a letter from \nthe IRS, but acknowledged that it was her responsibility to act on it.

She has an extra $50 taken out \nweekly for her past-due taxes. (Tr. 63, PH 3 at 2) She said her income and expenses \nare \u201cholding steady,\u201d although she has little to no current savings due to the home \nremodeling project. (Tr. 59-61) Her credit reports do not reflect any significant financial \nissues. (GE 3, GE 4) \nApplicant also has a federal tax lien filed in 2004, for $8,553. (GE 8) She testified \nthat she went to her county courthouse to research the status of the 2004 federal tax \nlien. The clerk told her they had no record of it. (Tr. 33-34) The 2004 tax lien is not \nalleged in the SOR. She acknowledged prior tax debt (2004 lien) and prior filing issues \n(2010-2016). She offered no explanation for the tax debt and said she had no excuse \nfor failing to file her tax returns, other than immaturity and the press of work and travel. \n(Tr. 40, 90) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted updated documentation about her recent \ntax filings. Her 2019 federal tax return, provided with extensive documentation, shows \ntaxable income of $57,493, and a $1,268 refund.

She acknowledged that she \nthought she had improved her standing by being honest about her past-due taxes but \nnow realizes there is more work to do. Her tax problems began when she was a single \nmother, raising her children without financial support, while working three jobs to make \nends meet. She had no excuse for failing to file her tax returns properly, but said she \nnever owed taxes until 2014. (This could mean \u201c2004,\u201d the year of the tax lien). She is \nnow in contact with the IRS to address her taxes. (PH 5, PH 6) \nApplicant closed her statement by stressing that she loves her job working with \nthe military, and feels rewarded by the work, as she does with nursing. She needs a \n\u201cCAC\u201d card to do her job. She offered to \u201ckeep someone updated\u201d on her progress, and \nrequested to leave the record open for another three to six months so she could hear \nfrom the IRS. She said she would resolve her taxes as soon as she could and will file \nher tax returns on time in the future. (PH 6) \nApplicant also provided several references, all of whom said she does a good job \nand is a valued, sought-after team member due to her comprehensive knowledge, \ntraining expertise, and communication skills. (PH 1) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, \nto a determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \n[trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe financial considerations guideline sets forth several conditions that could \nraise trustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA appeal board detailed the concern about applicants who fail to file their tax \nreturns as follows: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting [sensitive] information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a [trustworthiness] \nadjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, \n07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it \ndirected towards inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a \nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to [sensitive] information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for three tax years, \n2016, 2017, and 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The IRS calculated that she owed $40,291 in past-\ndue taxes for tax year 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant has been a DOD contractor since 2017. She has spent much of her \ntime traveling away from home. Her work involved long hours. For several years, she \nfailed to prioritize her tax filings, and she did not file three years of tax returns (2016, \n2017, and 2018) in a timely manner. She testified that she prepared and filed the \nreturns in 2020 while working out of state. The documents she provided, including \naccount transcripts from the IRS, show she filed her past-due returns in 2021 and 2022, \nwhich is after the SOR was issued. Regardless, she filed her past-due tax returns after \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceiving an interrogatory from DOHA about them, in March 2020 (and also after \ndeclaring tax issues on her 2019 application). \nApplicant has filed her past-due federal income tax returns, but she still owes \nover $40,000 in past-due taxes, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Further, according to her \nproposed installment agreement, the true amount she owes is almost $70,000. Her tax \ndebt also remains outstanding and unresolved, and continues to cast doubt on her \ncurrent judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s repeated failures to timely file her tax \nreturns and the resulting tax debt is her own responsibility, and she offered no excuse \nfor her situation which might be attributable to a circumstance beyond her control. \nApplicant has filed her overdue returns and has filed subsequent returns in timely \nmanner. She has made an installment agreement request to the IRS, proposing $500 \nmonthly payments. AG \u00b6 20(g) has some application, even though the IRS has not \nconfirmed the agreement. \nHowever, the fact that Applicant acted only when her public trust determination \nwas imperiled raises questions about her willingness to follow the sometimes complex \nrules governing protection of sensitive information when her personal interests are not \nat stake. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). Further, \nApplicant has not established a steady track record of payments to the IRS to resolve \nher significant tax debt. She needs to show such evidence in order to demonstrate \nongoing good faith. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. While I believe Applicant is sincere about her \nintentions to resolve her tax debts in the future, she needs to establish a track record of \nfinancial stability, good-faith steady payments towards her tax debts and tax filing \nrequirements before she can be considered eligible for access to sensitive information. \nOver time, she may demonstrate that track record in the future, and may then be \nreconsidered for public trust access. But at this time, that determination is premature. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a public trust position.  \nIn PH 6, Applicant also offered to \u201ckeep someone updated\u201d on her progress. I \nconstrue this as a request for a conditional clearance, under DOD Directive 5220.6, \nEnclosure 2, Appendix C. I have considered a conditional clearance, but I do not believe \nit is warranted in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.

In his FORM Response, Applicant provided an additional narrative statement addressing Department Counsel\u2019s arguments. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 64 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since 2009. His work during this timeframe has been in a combat zone. He was employed as a government employee from 2000 \u2013 2006. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1975 until he retired in 1998. He has no reported periods of unemployment. He last applied for a security clearance in 2009. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1984. He has been married since 2015, and has a daughter age 37. (Item 2) The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $83,000.

Applicant responded to the SOR on September 1, 2021, and requested \na decision by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record in lieu of a hearing. With his Answer, he \nprovided one exhibit, which I have marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. \nOn November 5, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) including Items 1-5.

He also provided brief narrative \nexplanations for some of the SOR allegations, and a longer narrative statement about \nhis financial problems. In his FORM Response, Applicant provided an additional \nnarrative statement addressing Department Counsel\u2019s arguments. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 64 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since \n2009. His work during this timeframe has been in a combat zone. He was employed as \na government employee from 2000 \u2013 2006. He served on active duty in the U.S. military \nfrom 1975 until he retired in 1998. He has no reported periods of unemployment. He last \napplied for a security clearance in 2009. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1984. He \nhas been married since 2015, and has a daughter age 37. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $83,000. Twelve of \nthe debts are charged off, and three are in a collection. The allegations are established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the 2019 and 2021 credit reports. Applicant did not \nprovide any documentation of the current status of the SOR debts. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5) \nThe status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in the amount of $11,840. The \naccount was opened in 2015, with a date of last activity in August 2019. Applicant states \nthat he was a cosigner on the loan for his step son. After a \u201cfalling out\u201d with his mother, \nthe step son left the car with Applicant, who then turned it in to the lender before he \nreturned to work overseas.

Applicant stated in his Answer that he turned the car into the lender because he \nwas deploying to work overseas. He provided no subsequent information of his efforts \nto address the remaining balance owed. (Items 1, 4) \nApplicant asserted in his Answer and his FORM Response that his financial \ndifficulties were caused by circumstances beyond his control. In 2017, his wife started \ntreatment for a medical condition, which was not covered by insurance. In June 2018, \nhis salary was reduced by $25,000 when his contract was assumed by a new employer. \nHe also lost $30,000 in income in 2020 due to the pandemic.

He asserts that this occurred both in mid-2017 and again in 2018. Applicant \nsaid he was not aware of this at the time. The situation impacted his finances when his \nmilitary retirement pay and VA disability pay were stopped in 2018, for about four \nmonths. His creditors also demanded full payment. He stated that he did not have the \nmoney to pay them in full, and they went unpaid while he figured out what to do next. \n(Item 1, FORM Response) \nApplicant claims he called several debt relief services, and was advised to \naddress his debts one at a time. He stated that once he confirms the identity of each \ncreditor, he plans to address his debts in this manner. He cited his payment of SOR \u00b6 \n1.m, as an example, but this payment is not documented. Applicant provided no \ndocumentation of payments made towards any of his SOR debts, any payment \nagreements established, or formal relationships with any debt relief service. (Items 1, 4) \nApplicant stated that his financial problems were an isolated incident. He argued \nthat his debts were not excessive, and but for his loss of income he could have paid his \ncreditors. He claims that these financial problems haven\u2019t happened before or since, \nand that he made a choice to pay his wife\u2019s medical treatments over his bills. He states \nthat during his many years of government service, he has never considered betraying \nhis country. He argues that his financial situation was beyond his control, and that his \ndebt has been dealt with or is being dealt with. He asserts that the credit reports being \nused by the government are from 2017 and 2018, when his accounts were frozen. (Item \n1, FORM Response) \nWhile some of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent after mid-2018, a review of \ncredit reports in the record indicate that the date of last activity for several SOR debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.n, for instance) are from early 2017 \u2013 before Applicant\u2019s \ninitial drop in income and before the first erroneous reports of his death. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports list only two accounts referencing Applicant \nas deceased (Items 4, 5, listing SOR \u00b6 1.n and the creditor for SOR 1.o, but a different \naccount). Applicant also provided a one-page credit statement from zumper.com \nindicating that he did not have a credit score because he was deceased. (Items 4, 5, AE \nA) \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have \nbeen paid, are being paid, or have been disputed. He also failed to provide \ndocumentation concerning his current financial situation, such as his monthly income \nand expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence of \ncredit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem  \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant asserted that his debts were caused or exacerbated by a variety of \ncircumstances beyond his control, but he gave little to no indication that any of his debts \nhave been paid, resolved, or are being actively addressed in a responsible way. He also \nprovided no documentation of any payments made, agreements established, or debts \nsettled, and no documentation of his current ability to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts are small and do not appear to be part of the larger \npattern of delinquent consumer debt. The creditors for these debts are not specifically \nidentified in the credit reports, and Applicant is not able to research them. I find the \nmedical debts do not represent a security concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. He did not provide any documentation that any of his debts have been, or are \nbeing paid, or otherwise resolved. He provided no documentation of his current financial \nsituation, evidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. \nHis debts are ongoing, recent, and not isolated, and they continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant is given consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b). His wife\u2019s medical issues, \nsome of which were not covered by insurance, had some impact on his finances. He \nalso experienced two instances of decreased income, both due to circumstances \nbeyond his control. However, the record shows that he started defaulting on his debts in \nearly 2017, before the first erroneous reports of his death, and before his instances of \nlost income. The record shows that his debts are unresolved and ongoing, and he did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to show that he undertook responsible action to address \nthem. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he has undertaken \ngood-faith efforts to address his debts. He gave little indication that any of his debts \nhave been or are being paid, and provided no documentation of any payments towards \nthem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant indicated in his Answer and his \nFORM Response that he consulted credit counselors, and indicated that he has begun \nto act on their advice by confirming his creditors\u2019 identity and paying off his debts one at \na time. He provided insufficient documentary evidence of any payments made on his \ndebts, or that his finances are under control or being resolved. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) potentially applies only to debts Applicant has denied. Medical debts \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, as noted, are found in his favor because they are not sufficiently \nidentified. Applicant did not, however, provide sufficient documented information to \ndispute SOR \u00b6 1.m., a repossessed auto account.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary and government service, and his work in a combat zone. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere largely caused by circumstances beyond his control, and will not recur. There is \ninsufficient reason to believe that these debts will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod. Some of Applicant\u2019s debts have been charged off for over five years. He did not \nmake reasonable efforts to resolve them. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I \nam unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, or that he made a \ngood-faith effort to pay his debts \nApplicant did not request a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to question him \nabout his financial issues, or to assess his credibility by observing his demeanor. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. My decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.o:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He used \nmarijuana once to twice monthly for anxiety relief, as a sleep aid, and to relax. He obtained \nmarijuana for his personal use from a friend and he used it alone or with a friend. He \nstated in his June 2020 interrogatory responses that he no longer personally possessed \nmarijuana and he used it recreationally, on occasion, with friends who purchased it.

He also testified that he \ndid not thoroughly read the January 2020 background interview summary when he \nadopted its accuracy in his June 2020 interrogatory responses.

(SOR; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. \nat 15, 21, 24-25, 27-45, 53-70) \nIn October 2013, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. \nA police officer pulled him over for a tinted license plate, the officer smelled marijuana, \nand Applicant admitted to the officer that he had marijuana in his car. During his January \n2020 background interview, he indicated that he obtained the marijuana from a friend \nbecause he needed it to sleep while he was visiting his parents. At the hearing, he \ntestified, however, that he did not obtain the marijuana for his personal use. Rather, he \nwas simply transporting the marijuana for his sibling who was going through a divorce. \nHe intended to offer the marijuana to his sibling as a way for his sibling to relax. He \ntestified that he had never used marijuana with his sibling. He hired an attorney, appeared \nin court, took an online drug education class, and paid a fine of a couple hundred dollars \nto have the charge expunged from his record. (SOR; Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. at 25-27, 45-\n52) \nApplicant stated in his 2019 SCA that he would not use marijuana if he were \nrequired to stop.

When he was asked during \nhis second background interview on February 7, 2020 about his discrepant statements \nregarding his future intent with marijuana, he indicated that he did not plan to use \nmarijuana in the future. He stated in his Answer and testified that he made his previous \nstatements about his future intent with marijuana under the idea that marijuana was legal \nor being made legal under state law. Upon further research, he testified that he \nunderstood marijuana remained illegal under federal law, and he intended to comply with \nboth state and federal laws and abstain from marijuana use in the future. He signed a \nstatement of intent in February 2022, in which he stated that he would abstain from any \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement \nor misuse would be grounds for revocation of his national security eligibility. (SOR; \nAnswer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. at 21-22, 31-32, 37-38, 68-73) \nApplicant testified that he manages his anxiety by living an active and healthy \nlifestyle.

(GE 2; AE A; Tr. at 21, 43-44, 68-73) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and, \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana from 1999 to 2020. In 2013, he was charged with \nmisdemeanor marijuana possession after he admitted to a police officer that he had \nmarijuana in his car. He made conflicting statements about his intention to use marijuana \nin the future on his SCA and during his two interviews with background investigators. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant testified that he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. He \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent in February 2022 that he would abstain from any \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and that violation of such would be grounds for \nrevocation of his national security eligibility. He also testified that he no longer socializes \nwith people who use illegal drugs. However, both the record evidence and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony continue to raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. I did not find Applicant to be candid or credible at the hearing. He has not taken \nresponsibility for his lengthy past drug use from 1999 to 2020. His testimony, that he last \nused marijuana in 2017, was inconsistent and in contradiction of the record evidence, to \ninclude his own admissions. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are \nnot established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns involving drug involvement and substance misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial consideration concerns.

For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 calendar \ndays to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to \nrespond. (Tr. 27) Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with \ndocumented payoffs of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions were admitted without objection as AEs F-J. \n     Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant accumulated five delinquent \neducational and consumer debts exceeding $46,000. Allegedly, these debts have not \nbeen resolved. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the alleged debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.b and 1.d-1.e), but denied the remaining debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, \nand provided explanations for each of his responses.

Credit reports confirm he co-signed a student loan \nwith his daughter that included a high credit allowance of $16,786. (GEs 2-3) While his \ndaughter made several payments initially on the loan, she failed to follow through with \nher scheduled payments and permitted the loan to fall into default by March 2018.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n         \nFinancial Considerations \n  The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .

Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

These reported delinquent SOR debts \nare accompanied by a considerable amount of extenuating circumstances and ensuing \nresponsible payment initiatives by Applicant. \nFinancial concerns \nCredit reports reveal that Applicant\u2019s five reported delinquent debts were \nunaddressed until recently. These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of \nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligation.\u201d Each \nof these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant\u2019s three admitted debts with \nexplanations and clarifications require no independent proof to substantiate them. See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). He \nadmitted debts are fully documented and create judgment issues as well over the \nmanagement of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nAlthough he qualified his admissions with explanations and clarifications, his admissions \ncan be weighed along with other evidence developed during the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held for many years. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree that she earned in 1996, and she took real estate classes in 2003.

Applicant and her second husband divorced in 2010. Her ex-husband received the house, but had to pay the mortgage loan, which was in both of their names. He was supposed to refinance the loan to remove Applicant\u2019s name from the loan. A credit report from February 2013 indicated that the mortgage loan was still in both of their names. A November 2019 credit report showed the mortgage loan as closed, apparently in May 2019.

She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held for \nmany years. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree that she earned in 1996, and she took real \nestate classes in 2003. She is twice married and divorced, with two adult children. She \nresides with her fianc\u00e9. (Tr. at 12-13, 30, 60-61, 94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, \n7) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $71,963. Applicant denied \nthat she currently owed the debts as they were beyond her state\u2019s statute of limitations. \nThe debts are established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \nApplicant and her second husband divorced in 2010. Her ex-husband received \nthe house, but had to pay the mortgage loan, which was in both of their names. He was \nsupposed to refinance the loan to remove Applicant\u2019s name from the loan. A credit \nreport from February 2013 indicated that the mortgage loan was still in both of their \nnames. A November 2019 credit report showed the mortgage loan as closed, \napparently in May 2019. (Tr. at 64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5, 7) \nApplicant borrowed from her 401(k) retirement account and bought a foreclosed \nhouse on her block for $24,500 in 2011. She knew the house needed work, but she did \nnot realize how much work until she started renovating it. At the time, Applicant lived \nnext door in a rented home with her boyfriend (not her current fianc\u00e9). Applicant, her ex-\nboyfriend, and a witness described how much work was put into the house by Applicant, \nher ex-boyfriend, and their friends. Applicant financed the out-of-pocket expenses of \nabout $75,000 with credit cards. She was unable to obtain a mortgage loan because \nshe was still on the loan on the house where her ex-husband was living. (Tr. at 22-24, \n34-39, 62-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5, 7; AE B) \nApplicant and her then boyfriend moved into the house about a year after the \npurchase. They fostered two siblings for a period. Applicant and her boyfriend later \nseparated, and he moved out in about 2018 or 2019. Applicant was able to keep her \ncredit cards current, but the high balances caused some of the cards to raise the \ninterest rates. (Tr. at 35, 40, 46-47, 63, 85-87, 91-92; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 3, 4, 7) \nIn about 2014, Applicant sought the services of a debt settlement company. She \nwas told to stop paying her credit cards, so that the company could negotiate \nsettlements with the creditors. She enrolled her debts into the company\u2019s debt relief \nplan. She paid $734 every two weeks into a dedicated account. The company would \nnegotiate settlements with her creditors and pay the settlement amounts, plus their fees, \nout of the dedicated account. (Tr. at 40-43, 64-66, 80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 7; AE B, C) \nOne of the creditors informed Applicant that she would be sued if she did not pay \nthat account. The debt settlement company was unable to help her.

She withdrew from the debt relief plan in \nabout October 2015. She paid a total of about $29,117 into the program. Two debts \ntotaling about $20,000 were settled. She received a refund of about $2,619, and the rest \nwent to the company\u2019s fees. (Tr. at 66-70, 80-85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5, \n7; AE B, C) \nApplicant settled the debt from the company that threatened to sue her, but did \nnot pay any other debt after she withdrew from the debt relief plan. She stated that she \nput the money in an account to be used if she was sued by another creditor or to \neventually pay the debts. (Tr. at 81-85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3-5, 7; AE \nA-C) \nApplicant went to a financial advisor in 2017. She wanted to pay her debts and \ncontemplated selling her house to do so. The advisor told her that she should keep the \nhouse, but work separately to pay her debts. She followed the advice to not sell the \nhouse, but she did not pay the debts. Applicant worked for her employer on temporary \nassignment in another state for an extended period in 2018. She was able to save \n$20,000, but that was not enough to pay the debts. She took another assignment in a \nthird state for almost a year. She worked long hours, six days a week. By the time she \nreturned in 2020, with overtime and per diem, she saved about $75,000, which was \nenough to pay her debts. (Tr. at 47-49, 70-72; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJuly 2019 while she was on temporary assignment for her company. She fully reported \nher financial issues and delinquent debts. She wrote: \u201cI am completely responsible for \nthe current debt and I have a plan in progress to pay it off.\u201d She was interviewed for her \nbackground investigation in December 2019. She stated that she believed that all of her \ndebts would be settled or paid by early 2020. (GE 1, 7) \nApplicant retained an attorney in 2020 to locate her creditors and ensure the right \ncompany was paid. After researching the debts, her attorney informed her that most of \nthe debts could not be legally enforced because they were beyond the statute of \nlimitations. Two of the debts might not have been beyond the statute of limitations \nbecause they were being paid by the debt settlement company. She followed his advice \nto not pay any of the debts. None of the debts alleged in the SOR have been paid. (Tr. \nat 72-75, 87-91, 98; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A, C) \nApplicant is engaged to be married to a gentleman she met on her last \nassignment. She sold her house in January 2022, which was unencumbered by any \nmortgage or lien, for $255,000. She is holding $80,000 from the proceeds as a down \npayment on a new home; she paid about $43,000 toward her student loans; and she \nbought a new car for about $30,000. Other than the unpaid SOR debts, her finances are \nin good shape. (Tr. at 76, 91-93; AE A) \nApplicant called witnesses, and she submitted documents and letters attesting to \nher excellent job performance and strong moral character.

She is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr. at 19-61; AE \nD) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for her to pay her debts, but clearly she could pay \nthe debts at some point, she just chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s plan to buy and renovate a house worked out very well for her. Not \nso much for most of the creditors that funded the renovations. She put a lot of \u201csweat \nequity\u201d into the house, as did her friends. She paid about $29,117 into the debt relief \nplan, settling two debts in the process, and she settled a third debt. Even accounting for \nthose figures, she profited more than$150,000 on the sale of her house, and she never \nhad to pay rent or a mortgage loan. \nApplicant is relying on the statute of limitations and that the debts are no longer \nlisted on her credit report. However, reliance on the statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve debts. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. He married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He has an adult child from the marriage. He remarried in 2015 and has no children from the marriage. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20; GE 1 In September 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). He disclosed he worked full time as a 1099 subcontractor from 2012 to 2018 for a federal employer. He also said he worked full time for his own business, Company Y. He clarified this in his testimony. During 2019 he worked part time for this employer, but also was working for his own business, Company Y. He testified that he started Company Y as a private business in 2011, but it did not become viable and profitable until about 2018 when he began receiving federal contracts. He continued for a period to work as a subcontractor, but at some point after 2018, he worked full time for his business. He is now a full-time employee and owner of Company Y. He said from 2018 to 2020 his company hired employees (3) and was not earning a lot of money. Applicant\u2019s wife is a co-owner of the company with 51% of the share. His 2021 income was at least $155,000 and likely a bit more, but he did not know the exact amount. His wife\u2019s income from the business was $135,000.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 7, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nOn October 13, 2020, Applicant requested additional time to respond to the SOR \nso he could receive and gather documents and prepare his answer. He was granted an \nextension until December 14, 2020. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \n1 \n\nDecember 15, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 10, 2022, scheduling the hearing for January 26, 2022, by \nMicrosoft Teams. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. There \nwere no objections. All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The record remained \nopened until February 15, 2021, to permit Applicant an opportunity to provide additional \nevidence. He timely provided AE C through H, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection, and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript on February 4, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He has an \nadult child from the marriage. He remarried in 2015 and has no children from the \nmarriage. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20; GE 1 \nIn September 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nHe disclosed he worked full time as a 1099 subcontractor from 2012 to 2018 for a federal \nemployer. He also said he worked full time for his own business, Company Y. He clarified \nthis in his testimony. During 2019 he worked part time for this employer, but also was \nworking for his own business, Company Y. He testified that he started Company Y as a \nprivate business in 2011, but it did not become viable and profitable until about 2018 when \nhe began receiving federal contracts. He continued for a period to work as a \nsubcontractor, but at some point after 2018, he worked full time for his business. He is \nnow a full-time employee and owner of Company Y. He said from 2018 to 2020 his \ncompany hired employees (3) and was not earning a lot of money. Applicant\u2019s wife is a \nco-owner of the company with 51% of the share. His 2021 income was at least $155,000 \nand likely a bit more, but he did not know the exact amount. His wife\u2019s income from the \nbusiness was $135,000. He was unsure of his earnings in 2020 and 2019. He said in \n2017 he earned about $60,000 as a subcontractor. He provided a copy of his 2018 IRS \n1040 showing his income before taxes was approximately $31,352. He did not provide \nIRS 1040s for previous or subsequent years. (Tr. 20-26, 52-54; GE 1; AE H) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to the Department of Education (DOE) for \n10 collection accounts for student loans totaling approximately $39,252. These loans \nwere obtained from 2012 to 2014. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$5,776; 1.b-$5,050; 1.c-$4,717; 1.d-\n$4,518; 1.o-$5,624; 1.p-$4,397; 1.q-$2,626; 1.r-$2,626; 1.s-$1,315; and 1.t-$2,603). (Tr. \n82; GE 1 through 8) \nThe SOR also alleges Applicant is indebted to another student loan creditor, XYZ \nand has eight collection accounts totaling approximately $20,204. These loans were \n2 \n\nobtained from 2003 to 2006. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-$3,808; 1.f-$3,513; 1.g-$2,636; 1.h-$2,620; 1.i-\n$2,230; 1.j-$1,959; 1.k-$1,755 and 1.l-$1,683). (GE 1 through 8) \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2009 SCA, he disclosed he graduated high school in \n2001. He attended college from 2001 to 2004, but did not earn a degree. He attended a \nvocational school from July 2007 to November 2008 and earned a master\u2019s license. He \nstated that he had four classes to complete to earn his Associate\u2019s in Arts degree, which \nhe intended on completing in the spring semester. (Tr. 18-19; GE 2) \nIn the financial disclosure section of his 2009 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had \ndefaulted on a loan in July 2009 to his state\u2019s student-loan authority. He stated: \nI took our student loans during [c]ollege to pay for my tuition and books and \nafter leaving college I was unable to pay back the loan. I have made large \nsum payments over the years, but defaulted about a year ago. I made \npayment arrangements with them 6 months ago and am in the process of \npaying the full loan amount back with [interest]. I never intended to default \non this loan but I was just making ends meet and couldn\u2019t afford to make \nthe monthly payment. I am now in a financial positon to repay the loan. \nA September 2009 credit report (GE 7) reflects eight delinquent student loans \nobtained from 2003 to 2006 for a total of approximately $19,472. The last payments made \nwere in October 2008 and September 2009. Applicant testified that he made lump sum \npayments towards the loans, but could not afford to repay them. He explained the lump \nsum payments were his income tax refunds that were withheld by the IRS and applied to \nhis student loan debt. He believed this happened in 2017, 2018 and 2019, but was \nuncertain. These amounts decreased his balance, but did not satisfy it. He said these \namounts would have been sufficient to cover his monthly payments. (Tr. 57-64; GE 7) \nApplicant testified that there were periods of time between 2006 and 2018 that he \nwas enrolled in college and the loans would have been deferred. In September 2019, \nApplicant completed another SCA for reinvestigation. In it he disclosed he has been \nattending college from 2011 to the present. Applicant provided a narrative in a post-\nhearing document with an explanation and a copy of his academic student transcript. (AE \nD, E) He explained it showed the semesters he received credit toward an undergraduate \ndegree from 2011 to 2018. The document does not detail what semesters he was in \nschool and when his loans would have been deferred prior to 2011, except as he \npreviously noted. He further explained that from 2018 until the present he has been \nunable to earn additional credits toward a degree, but intends to start in the fall of 2022. \n(Tr. 61-62, 65; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s college transcripts reflect the following: \n2011-credits transferred in the fall of 2011 from previous college. No specific prior \nyears\u2019 attendance is detailed. \n2012-spring term-two classes. \n3 \n\n2013-spring term-one class. \n2013-summer term-two classes. \n2013-fall term-one class. \n2014-spring term-two classes. \n2014-fall term-two classes. \n2018-fall term-one class. \nIn the financial disclosure section of his 2019 SCA, he disclosed he was currently \nover 120 days\u2019 delinquent to a student-loan agency. He disclosed the amount owed was \n$35,000. He stated: \u201cUnable to pay all bills and student loans while starting a business.\u201d \n(GE 1) He further stated: \u201cWorking on consolidation loan with provider to remove loans \nfrom default status and begin repayment.\u201d (GE 1) He listed as the date the financial issue \narose as January 2018 and the date it was resolved as September 2019. He stated: \n\u201cProvided tax refunds to be applied to student loan debt yearly. Working with provider to \nestablish consolidation loan and remove from default status.\u201d (Tr. 64; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2019 as part \nof his background investigation. During the interview he confirmed that he had student \nloans with DOE and XYZ. He said he owed DOE approximately $35,895 and he had \ninadvertently failed to disclose the debt to XYZ on SCA. He believed he owed XYZ about \n$19,535. He was researching consolidating the loans and participating in a loan \nrehabilitation program. Applicant stated his loans were in forbearance when he attended \ncollege in 2016, and he estimated his last loan payment was made in 2016. He believes \nthe DOE accounts have been in and out of collection since 2018 and the XYZ accounts \nsince 2017. He said his monthly payments were $450, but was unable to provide the \ninvestigator with details about his payments. Applicant did not provide evidence he made \nthe monthly payments of $450. He told the investigator that he intended to consolidate \nhis student loans by December 2019. His testified that he did not make any payments on \nthese loans from 2017 to September 2020. (Tr. 83-86, 90-91; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant further explained to the investigator that he started his own business in \nJanuary 2018 and experienced financial problems. He said he had to pay the business \nfirst and then take what was left to pay himself. He was not receiving a consistent dollar \namount each paycheck. However, he was now in a better financial situation because his \nbusiness had improved, and he was willing to pay his debts. (GE 3) \nApplicant was asked by the investigator about a cash withdrawal on September \n2018 from a bank in the amount of $16,000. Applicant explained this was to purchase a \nboat for the business. Applicant testified that his business is in the maritime industry and \nthe boat is required. (Tr. 104-106; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s credit report from April 2020 reflects his XYZ student loans were in \ndefault in 2015. The DOE were in default from 2017. He testified that he believed he was \nin school, so the loans should have been deferred. He then explained that they likely were \nin default in 2018-2019 because he was investing in his business and prioritized \npayments to his employees. He estimated that over the years, but more in the past few \n4 \n\nyears, he invested between $75,000 and $150,000 in the business. The business began \nto become profitable around 2020. His February 2021 credit report lists the DOE student \nloans in collection. (Tr. 64-72, 93-96; GE 5, 7) \nApplicant was asked what action he took after his October 2019 interview to \nconsolidate and pay his delinquent students loans, and he said he was researching his \noptions. Applicant provided a copy of a letter from the collection company for his DOE \nstudent loans dated October 14, 2020, acknowledging his September 11, 2020 request \nto rehabilitate his student loans. He included the account numbers of the DOE loans and \nthe current balances owed including interest and collection costs. The total amount was \n$46,236. As part of the rehabilitation program, Applicant was required to pay $5 a month \nfor nine months. Due to the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, his loans \nwere placed in forbearance. When asked if he made any of the $5 monthly payments, he \nsaid no, because he was not required. He was told he would still get credit for \nrehabilitating the loan over the next nine months, but did not have to make the $5 \npayments. He provided a letter from DOE from June 1, 2021, stating that his defaulted \nstudent loans were rehabilitated and had been transferred from the DOE Default \nResolution Group, which services defaulted federal student loans to a new loan servicer. \nHe also provided a document to show he submitted a request for an automatic monthly \npayment of $140 to be made for his DOE student loans, which was to start on January \n20, 2022. Applicant testified that when this loan comes out of forbearance his monthly \npayment will be based on his income. He did not know yet what the amount will be. (Tr. \n31-36, 41-47; 78-79, 82, 87-89; Answer to the SOR; GE 1; AE A, B, D, G) \nApplicant provided information that his XYZ student loans were now held by a \ndifferent creditor. He acknowledged and the document notes there are eight loans that \nwere incurred from 2003 to 2006 and totaled approximately $19,693. In September 2020, \nhe requested they be consolidated. The program did not require him to make any good-\nfaith payments. The consolidation was approved in October 2020, which took the loans \nout of default status and they are in good standing. His monthly payment is $131. The \nloans are in forbearance under the CARES Act. The document states that during the \nforbearance, payment may still be made and one can opt-out of it and resume a \nrepayment plan. I asked if he had made the monthly payments, and he said no because \nhe is not required to do so in accordance with the CARES Act during the forbearance. \nApplicant testified that he made a payment of $2,500 on January 11, 2022, even though \nhe was not required to do so. (Tr. 31-36, 41-42, 56, 72-82; Answer to the SOR; AE B, F) \nApplicant testified that the documents he provided show his student loans were \nconsolidated or rehabilitated and were in good standing before the date of the SOR and \ntherefore the SOR is inaccurate because the student loan were not in default and do not \nremain delinquent. (Tr. 31-34, 73; AE A, B) \nApplicant testified that he has reestablished payment plans for his student loans \nand there were plenty of times he made payments on the accounts and had periods when \nthey were not in default. He noted from 2006 to 2012, he made payments, but there were \nalso periods the loans were in default. (Tr. 111-116) \n5 \n\nThe SOR alleges two medical collection debts (\u00b6\u00b61.m-$355 and 1.n-$36) that \nbecame delinquent in 2015. Applicant testified that he was unaware of these debts until \nhe obtained a copy of his credit report in October 2019. He disputed the charges with his \ninsurance company and also on his credit report. He provided documents to show he paid \nthe debts in October 2020. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 35, 54-56; Answer to the SOR; \nGE 5, 6) \nApplicant and his wife purchased a home in March 2021 for $820,000. Due to \nApplicant\u2019s credit rating, the mortgage is in his wife\u2019s name, because they could get a \nbetter interest rate, but the deed is in both of their names. Their monthly mortgage \npayment is approximately $2,500. They made a cash down payment of approximately \n$155,000. Applicant testified that his share of the down payment was about $75,000. \nThey own a condo where they previously lived and now rent. The rent covers the \nmortgage, but not beyond that. They did not sell it due to the market. He has \napproximately $60,000 in a 401(k) pension plan and his wife has about $100,000. He and \nhis wife have about $50,000 in personal savings accounts. They purchased a new vehicle \nin 2020 for $40,000. He took a loan from his pension to pay for it and then repaid the loan. \n(Tr. 26-30, 102-104) \nApplicant traveled for pleasure in 2014 to the Dominican Republic (1-5 days), in \n2017 to the Bahamas (6-10 days), in 2018 to Italy (6-10 days), and in 2019 to the \nBahamas (6-10 days). He also took skiing trips for three to four days to Aspen, Colorado \n(2020) and Steamboat Springs, Colorado (2021). He testified that he paid his airfare for \nhis skiing trips to Colorado, but the rooms were complimentary. (Tr. 106-110; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that he is a patriot and has supported defense department \nprograms since 2009, and would not do anything to jeopardize his country. He said he \npaid other priorities, such as paying his employees. He admitted he should have taken \naction on the student loans and been consistent. He said he did make payments on his \nstudent loans over the years and they were not always in default, but did not have a record \nof them. His finances have never been as good as they are now, and he does not see \nany reason why he would default on the student loans again. He intends to pay them back \nbased on the income-based repayment plan. He has made no other recent payment other \nthan the $2,500 made in January 2022. He intends to pay his monthly loan payments. \n(Tr. 110-111; 115-116) \nApplicant provided character letters from a manager and coworker. He is described \nas dedicated, hardworking, innovative, knowledgeable, and proud. He has an admirable \nwork ethic and a high level of accountability. He exercises good judgment and has high \nmoral standards. (Answer to the SOR) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n6 \n\nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent student loans that he obtained beginning in \n2003 totaling approximately $59,456 that at various times over the past 19 years have \nbeen in default. He has prioritized other personal and business interests over his \nresponsibility for paying his student loans. He had two medical debts that had been \ndelinquent since 2015. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n8 \n\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent student loans in his 2009 SCA and that he had \nbeen unable to repay them. He said he made large lump sum payments over the years. \nHe was referring to the IRS\u2019s involuntary withholding of his income tax refunds. He \ndisclosed in his SCA that he made payment arrangements and was in the process of \npaying the full loan back. He attributed his financial problems to underemployment, but \nsaid he was now in a financial position to repay the loans. He did not provide evidence of \nhis repayment plan from 2009 or payments he made when his loans were not deferred. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were deferred at various time in the last 19 years while \nhe attended college classes. He is not required to make loan payments when they are \ndeferred while attending school. He also obtained additional student loans in 2012 to \n2014. His student loans were in and out of default status over the years. \nIn September 2019, as part of his security clearance reinvestigation, Applicant \nagain disclosed his delinquent student loans and said he was unable to pay them because \nhe was starting a business. He also said he was working on consolidating the loans and \nwould begin a repayment plan. He anticipated the financial issue being resolved in \nSeptember 2019. He said he was providing his tax refunds to his student loan debt. He \nwas referring to the involuntary capture of his tax refunds by the IRS. \nIn October 2019, continuing his background reinvestigation, Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that he was aware of his delinquent student loans and was in the \nprocess of consolidating them. Eleven months later, in September 2020, he applied for \nthe loans to be rehabilitated and consolidated, which were approved, and his loans are in \ngood standing after completing this process. He also acknowledged that because of the \nCARES Act, he did not have to make any payments to complete the rehabilitation \nprogram. Although his loans are reflected to be in good standing, Applicant has not yet \nmade consistent monthly payments in accordance with the repayment plan. He may \nlegitimately rely on the CARES Act forbearance. However, he has not yet established a \n9 \n\nreliable financial track record showing consistent payments over a significant period of \ntime. In the past, Applicant has promised to repay his student loans and said he was in a \npayment plan, yet his loans became delinquent. \nApplicant relies on the documents from the student loan creditors that the loans \nare in good standing and are no longer in default and therefor the security clearance \nfinancial considerations should be resolved in his favor. Although President Biden \nextended a pause on the collection of student loans due to COVID-19, thus creating \na deferment period on student-loan payments, that action does not excuse \npreviously delinquent student loans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527) \nAn applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Applicant \nstands on the fact that the SOR is dated October 7, 2020, and his application for \nrehabilitation and consolidation was in September 2020, prior to the issuance of the SOR. \nHis argument is disingenuous. Applicant fails to recognize the gravity and longevity of his \nfailure to address his delinquent student loans and that he was on notice about them \nwhen he completed his 2009 and 2019 SCA, and when he was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in October 2019. He indicated in his 2019 SCA his intent to \nresolve the student loan issue by September 2019 and during his interview he said he \nwould address it by December 2019. The fact he had the loans consolidated and \nrehabilitated days before the SOR does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndebts. \nApplicant has promised before to address delinquent students loan, but failed to \ndo so. The fact he decided to start a business and use his financial resources to fund that \nbusiness was a choice. Applicant provided a copy of his 2018 IRS 1040 tax return \nshowing he earned approximately $31,000. He did not provide other years\u2019 income \nstatements. He also disclosed that he took three pleasure trips from 2017 to 2019. He \nchose to purchase a house in 2021 and was able to put $75,000 in cash towards the \ndown payment. Repaying his student loans has repeatedly taken a backseat to his other \nfinancial choices. The Appeal Board has held that intentions to pay debts in the future are \nnot a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. \nSee ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \n10 \n\nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his student loans over the years. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find the above mitigating conditions do not apply. I \nfind that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s student loans are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not demonstrated a reliable financial track record in addressing his \nstudent loans, and he has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

According to updated IRS transcripts (AE F \u2013 G), Applicant \nfiled the 2016 federal income tax return in March 2020, indicating he was owed a $10,137 \nrefund that was applied to the outstanding $17,531 tax liability for the 2017 tax year. He \nfiled the 2017 tax return in April 2020, indicating that he was owed a $17,889 refund of \nwhich the IRS transferred $11,244 to another, unspecified non-IRS debt. He also provided \na receipt from the state tax authority showing payment of $2,673 in taxes for the 2016 \nand 2017 tax years. (Tr. 39-45, 58-60; AE A-C) \nApplicant provided a completed copy of his 2018 federal and state income tax \nreturns, signed by Applicant and his wife in February 2022. He overpaid his state and \nfederal income taxes and was due a refund. He provided photographs showing that he \nmailed the returns to the state and federal tax authorities on February 22, 2022. At the \ntime the record closed, Applicant did not provide any evidence that he had filed his 2019 \nor 2020 income tax returns. (Tr. 46-47; AE C, I-M) \nAfter separating from the Air Force, Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s \ndegrees and completed some additional post-graduate work toward a doctoral degree. \nHe financed his education through student loans. He testified that between 2015, when \nhe stopped taking classes, and 2020, he did not make any payments toward his student \nloans. He could not afford to make payments consistently as the obligation was nearly \n$3,000 per month. Applicant claimed that two periods of unemployment between \nNovember 2017 and March 2018, and November 2018 to January 2019, also prevented \nhim from paying his student loans as he focused on paying his household bills. At time of \nthe hearing, the loans were in forbearance under the COVID -19 student loan payment \npause announced by President Biden in March 2020. Applicant contacted his loan \nservicer to arrange his participation in a rehabilitation program set to begin in March 2022, \nwith a monthly payment of $1,400. Since then, President Biden has extended the student \nloan payment moratorium through January 1, 2023. It is unknown if Applicant decided to \nbegin participation in the rehabilitation program as scheduled, or to keep the loans in \nforbearance status. (Tr. 26-27, 31-36, 60-62,65; AE E, N-R) \nThe SOR alleges the Applicant also owes two delinquent consumer accounts.\nAccording to a credit report, dated January 2022, Applicant paid the $987 charged-off \naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (AE D) Applicant claims that he does not recall incurring \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($6,897) owed to the university where he did his post-\ngraduate studies. That debt remains unresolved.

To date, the credit-repair company has helped Applicant to remove \n44 negative items from his credit report.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially over extended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.

Applicant has \ndemonstrated both a history of financial problems, evidenced by a history of delinquent \nstudent loan accounts, as well as a failure to timely comply with his federal and state tax \nobligations. \nThe following financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and, \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2016. There is \nsome evidence in mitigation, two periods of unemployment, totaling eight months \nbetween November 2017 and January 2019, as well as his participation in a credit repair \nplan. He has filed the 2016 and 2017 federal and state income tax returns alleged in the \nSOR, and did not owe additional federal taxes as indicated by the substitute tax returns \nfiled by the IRS. Though not alleged in the SOR, he provided evidence of a paid state tax \nliability for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. AG \u00b6 20 (g), \u201cthe individual has made \narrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is \ncompliance with those arrangements,\u201d partially applies. Applicant still has outstanding \nfederal and state tax returns for at least 2018 through 2020. His continued failure to timely \nfile his federal and state income tax returns indicates that he still does not have a handle \non his tax obligations. He provided no compelling reason for his inability to do so. Although \nApplicant\u2019s student loans are in good standing as a result of the student loan payment \npause, this is not considered evidence of rehabilitation because he has not established a \ntrack record of repayment. Because evidence of ongoing financial problems remains, the \nfinancial considerations concern is not fully mitigated. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). During his 22-year military career, Applicant held a security \nclearance without incident. He is also involved his local community through the church he \n6 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfounded and leads with his wife. However, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his ongoing failure to meet his federal and \nstate income tax obligations. He has also failed to establish that his delinquent student \nloan debt is rehabilitated or otherwise under control. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b, 1.e - 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 51-year-old image technician employed by a defense contractor since November 2014. He served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard from August 1988 to September 1989 and in the U.S. Air Force Reserve from January 1990 to January 1992. He received honorable discharges after each period of military service. He married in February 1995 and divorced in October 2013. He has three adult children. He has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $13,685 in federal income taxes for tax year 2013 and $13,747 for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.b). It also alleges that he has a child-support arrearage of $12,590 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).

On \nOctober 2, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard from August \n1988 to September 1989 and in the U.S. Air Force Reserve from January 1990 to January \n1992. He received honorable discharges after each period of military service. He married \nin February 1995 and divorced in October 2013. He has three adult children. He has never \nheld a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $13,685 in federal income taxes for tax year \n2013 and $13,747 for tax year 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.b). It also alleges that he has a \nchild-support arrearage of $12,590 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Upon motion of Department Counsel, I \ncorrected a scrivener\u2019s error in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleged a tax debt of \u201c$13,747.59.00,\u201d \nby striking the last two zeroes. (Tr. 15.)  \nApplicant\u2019s SCA reflects that he worked in the private sector from at least February \n2003 to November 2014. (GX 1 at 15-21.) He was self-employed from February 2013 to \nNovember 2014, in three separate businesses jointly owned by him and his wife. He \ncontinued to work in the private sector from May 2012 to April 2013, and July to November \n2014, but was dependent on income from the three businesses from April 2013 to July \n2014. (Tr. 21-22.) He received 20% of the revenue from the businesses, and his wife \nreceived 80%. The businesses failed when they lost their biggest client. He worked in the \nprivate sector from July to November 2014, when he was hired by his current employer. \nIn May 2013, Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter accused him of sexually abusing her, \nand he was charged with felony sexual activity with a child. The charges were dismissed \nand the records expunged after he submitted the results of an exculpatory polygraph. The \nrecord does not reflect the entire factual basis for dismissing the charges. Applicant \nincurred attorney\u2019s fees between $7,000 and $8,000, responding to his daughter\u2019s \naccusation. (GX 3 at 2.) He paid his attorney by using money that he had saved to pay \ntaxes. \nApplicant had been having marital problems for about three years at the time his \ndaughter accused him of abusing her.

(Tr. 45-46.) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 2016 and received a \ndischarge in May 2016. The discharged debts were personal consumer debts. (GX 4 at \n1; GX 5 at 1; Tr. 49.) The bankruptcy is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for 2013 in November 2014. The IRS \naccount transcript for that year reflects that he owed $13,685, the amount alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. He filed his federal income tax return for 2014 in February 2016, and the IRS \ntranscript for that year reflects that he owed $13,747, the amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant testified that he hired a tax service in 2013. (Tr. 25.) The tax transcripts \nreflect appointment of a representative in January 2015, July 2015, August 2015, March \n2016, June 2016, June 2017, and June 2018. Applicant testified that his current tax \nservice was the only representative that he hired, and that they helped him to be placed \nin a non-collectible status. (Tr. 27-28.) \nApplicant filed his tax return for 2015 in October 2016, owed $22, and paid it. The \npenalty for late filing ($0.63) was written off by the IRS in November 2016. (AX-A.) He \ntimely filed his federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. For 2016, he received \na $24 credit applied to his tax debt from 2013. He owed $51 for 2017 and $26 for 2018, \nwhich he paid. (GX 2 at 29-32.) He testified that all his tax returns through 2020 have \nbeen filed. (Tr. 34.) \nIn December 2015, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for $9,303. (GX 4 at \n2.) He contacted the IRS in September 2016 regarding his tax debt. In October 2016, the \nIRS responded to his inquiry and sent him a letter stating that he owed $22,145 for tax \nyears 2013, 2014, and 2015, but that his case was closed as non-collectable. The IRS \nnotified him that it might reopen his case if his financial situation improved. It also notified \nhim that he could make voluntary payments, and that he might be a candidate for an offer \nin compromise. (GX 2 at 8-10.) Applicant testified that he stopped reading the IRS letter \nafter he read that the debt was non-collectable, and he did not notice the provisions for \nvoluntary payments, the possibility of an offer in compromise, or the notice that the IRS \nmight decide to pursue collection if his financial status improved. (Tr. 52-53.) He testified \nthat his tax service told him that the delinquent taxes would be forgiven after ten years. \n(Tr. 26.) \nIn April 2020, Applicant asked the IRS for information about tax year 2015. He \nreceived a written response informing him that the IRS was not able to process his request \nat the time. (GX 2 at 27-28.) There is no evidence in the record reflecting a response from \nthe IRS. \nIn October 2020, Applicant filed an IRS Form 2848, Power of Attorney and \nDeclaration of Representative, listing four attorneys from the same law firm. There is no \nevidence reflecting what actions, if any, that the attorneys took to resolve the tax debt. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(AX C.) He testified that he did not know that his debt had been removed from non-\ncollectible status until he received the SOR in February 2021, called the IRS, and was \ninformed telephonically by an IRS representative that his debt was no longer in a non-\ncollectible status. (Tr. 30-32.) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting \nthe removal of his tax debt from its non-collectible status. In December 2021, he contacted \nhis tax service for help. A letter from the tax service recites that it is \u201cin the process of \nbringing [Applicant\u2019s] IRS account into full compliance and negotiating a resolution for the \nbalances.\u201d The tax service is hoping for a \u201cformal resolution or compromise\u201d within a few \nmonths. (AX B.) (Tr. 31.) Applicant testified that the tax service is waiting for the IRS to \npost his return for 2020. (Tr. 33.)  \nIn October 2013, Applicant was ordered by the domestic relations court to pay \n$1,393 per month in child support. He was unable to pay that amount, but he paid $100 \nper week and accumulated an arrearage of $24,657. In August 2019, the court \nrecomputed his obligation, determined that he had made payments in excess of what he \nwas obligated to pay on the arrearage, and determined that his arrearage was $12,590, \nthe amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The court reduced his monthly payments on the \narrearage to $454. (GX 2 at 20-21.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nhad reduced the arrearage to $5,708. At the hearing, he provided documentation that his \nchild-support arrearage was paid in full in August 2021. (AX D and E.) His children are \nnow adults. \nSince about April 2020, Applicant\u2019s monthly net income has been about been \nabout $2,005. His monthly expenses have been about $1,252, leaving a net remainder of \nabout $753. (GX 2 at 7.) He lives with his mother and drives a car owned by his \ngrandfather. His checking account has a balance of about $500. He does not have a \nretirement account or any investments. (Tr. 37-38.) He has bank savings of about $4,000. \nA credit report dated March 26, 2021, reflects zero balances on all his credit cards. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts are recent and \nunresolved, but they were incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, i.e., \nsubstantial legal fees to defend his daughter\u2019s accusations and legal fees for a divorce \nresulting in part from his daughter\u2019s accusations. His child-support arrearage is not likely \nto recur, because all of his children are adults. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. The accusation by his daughter (if it was false), the \nfailure of his three businesses, his divorce, and the lack of timely response by the IRS to \ninquiries were conditions largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly by hiring a tax \nservice to assist him, keeping in contact with the IRS, timely filing his income tax returns \nfor 2015 and subsequent years, and paying the taxes due for those years. He was \nnegligent in not paying attention to the conditions in the notice of non-collectability when \nhe received it, but he was not in a good financial position to make voluntary payments or \nnegotiate a payment plan because of his limited income and his payments to resolve the \nchild-support arrearage. He was not notified by the IRS that his tax status had changed \nuntil he contacted the IRS after receiving the SOR. As soon as he learned about the status \nchange, he promptly contacted his tax service. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant has received tax advice and \nassistance from a legitimate tax service, but the record falls short of \u201cclear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant has not resolved his tax debt, but he \nhas resolved the child-support arrearage. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax service had not yet reached an \nagreement with the IRS by the time the record closed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. He has \nsuffered multiple financial setbacks, but he has not ignored them. He has limited income \nand lives frugally. He has resolved the child-support arrearage. He has timely filed his \nincome tax returns and paid the taxes due for 2015 to 2020. He has experienced a well-\nknown and common problem with lack of timely IRS response to inquiries, but he is \nactively working with his tax service to resolve his tax debt from 2013 and 2014. \nI have considered the possibility of granting a conditional security clearance in \naccordance with Appendix C of the Directive, but I have concluded that it is not necessary. \nThe decision to grant a security clearance is always subject to reconsideration when \nadditional adverse information is found. If Applicant fails to follow through with his current \nefforts to resolve his tax debt, a reconsideration of his suitability for a security clearance \nis likely. I am confident that he will continue his efforts to resolve his tax debt, especially \nsince the substantial financial burden of the child-support arrearage has been removed. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): `FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Unlike his \nFebruary 2021 answer to SOR 1.t, he denied SOR 1.t in his May 2021 amended \nanswer, claiming that the account is in his name and confirming (without supporting \ndocumentation) there is less than $300 in that account. He noted that \u201cwe do not have \nany substantial interests in Korea, or in any foreign business\u2026\u201d (May 2021 answer to \nthe SOR) \nIn his May 2021 amended answer, Applicant denied SOR 1.u, explaining his \nrights to the annuity and indicating the retirement contributions are too small to create a \nconflict of interest. In his response to SOR 1.v, Applicant emphasized that he never \nprovided any services for any foreign government. In working for previous law firms, he \nprovided legal services for firm clients located in foreign countries, and not foreign \ncountries. He no longer works for these firms. In examining the record in this case, I \nobserved Applicant\u2019s demeanor as I listened to his testimony. I found his testimony to \nbe generally credible. The discrepancies between his testimony and the information that \nhe provided on the same person during the background investigation are reduced in \nsignificance by the volume and short relationship of most of the contacts (more than 50) \nthat Applicant reported in his October 2017 security clearance application and his \ninterrogatory answers in June 2020. See GE 1 and GE 2. \nIn 1972, Applicant was born in the United States to Korean parents who are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, and who have lived in this country for 40 years. He does not \nregard himself as a dual citizen of another country. He has a U.S. passport and has \nnever been issued a passport by another country; his wife has a South Korean \npassport, but as a homemaker she does not travel. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1994 and his juris doctor\u2019s degree in 1997. He passed two bars in two states and has \nbeen a practicing attorney for at least 22 years.

Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s 31-year-\nold niece is also a citizen and resident of South Korea.

Applicant communicates with \nthis individual whenever he visits South Korea. With their families living two blocks from \none another and having their children attend the same schools in their U.S \nneighborhood, I find that their relationship was more than at an acquaintance level, \neven though the close relationship ended in about 2013, when Applicant believes this \nperson returned to South Korea. Applicant\u2019s wife has never interacted with the minister \nof finance. Applicant does not know whether the individual still has the government job. \nIn October 2017, Applicant considered his phone and face-to-face contact with this \nperson as quarterly.

In 2016, a Korean organization \nresponsible for sponsoring startups through education and training, sponsored an \nAmerican company not affiliated with the Korean government. The American company \nhired Applicant to provide lectures in intellectual property law over a six-week period. \nUltimately, Applicant was hired by four Korean startup companies to do trademark \nregistration for them, and was paid on a flat fee basis about $1,000 per company. \nWithout explaining the basis for his conclusion, he determined there was no conflict of \ninterest because none of the startup companies were controlled by the organization \nproviding the training and education for the startup companies or the Korean \ngovernment.

Considering the lack of evidence \ndemonstrating that Applicant performed legal services for a foreign country, I find no \npotential conflict of interest to Applicant\u2019s potential security responsibilities that would \nincrease the risk of a compromise of classified or sensitive information. Therefore, SOR \n1.v is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor under both the foreign influence and outside activities \nguidelines. \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to his South Korean bank account (Tr. 68), Applicant\u2019s family was \neligible for medical benefits (unalleged) provided by the Korean health care system \nbased on his South Korean employment between 2001 and 2006.

He has $80,000 to $100,000 in his retirement income accounts. He began \naccruing his bank and retirement accounts in 1999 when he moved to the United \nStates. Applicant and his wife have two cars. Since he ended his teaching job in 2006, \nApplicant has returned to South Korea about every two years for professional reasons, \nfor conferences and seminars, or to visit family and friends. (GE 1 at 115-130; Tr. 31-40, \n45) \nCharacter Evidence \nReference C is an attorney with prior military service, having served the U.S \nmilitary for 12 years. Reference C has known Applicant since 2009 and worked with him \non legal matters involving Korean clients. As a practicing attorney, Applicant has always \ncomplying with professional responsibility rules. Reference C vouches for Applicant\u2019s \nresponsible and trustworthy behavior. (AE C) \nReference D, a U.S. citizen by birth, is Applicant\u2019s first cousin. They have \nknown one another since early childhood and were roommates in college. Reference D \nindicated that he and Applicant have six aunts and uncles living in the United States. No \nadditional information was provided identifying their residency status. According to \nreference D, 18 of the children of the six aunts and uncles are U.S. citizens (cousins) \nliving in the Eastern part of the United States, and most are married. (The description of \nthe 18 cousins implies that there are remaining cousins who are not U.S citizens, or are \nliving in a foreign country.) Reference D considers Applicant a trustworthy person who \ndemonstrates that he cares about the future of his children. (AE D) \nReference E, Applicant\u2019s first cousin and a U.S citizen, has known him since \nchildhood. Their mothers are sisters who have lived in a city in the eastern part of the \nUnited States for approximately 40 years. They attended college together. Reference E \nlives in the same U.S. county as Applicant and interacts with him at social and sporting \nevents. (AE E) \nReference F, a U.S. citizen and priest of a U.S. church, has known Applicant \nsince 2008 when reference F was the priest of another U.S. church (Church X) where \nApplicant met most of the individuals identified in SOR 1f. through 1.s. Church X \nconducts religious services in four different languages. \nChurch X had Korean members from the Korean Embassy, Korean news \norganizations, and Korean companies.

Based on his dependability and integrity, reference F attests to \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. (AE F) \nReference G is the director of a federal records agency, with 45 years of U.S. \nmilitary and civilian service. He has possessed several security clearances in that time. \nHe has known Applicant since 2000. Their wives are sisters. Before reference G \nreceived higher level security clearances, his background investigation included scrutiny \nof his immediate and extended family members, as well as Applicant\u2019s immediate and \nextended family members. Applicant is proud to be a U.S. citizen and his \ntrustworthiness is unwavering. (AE G) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Republic of Korea \nThe Republic of South Korea is a stable constitutional democracy, governed by \na president and a unicameral legislature. The country has been close allies with the \nUnited States since 1950. Currently, thousands of U.S. service persons are stationed in \nSouth Korea, and the two countries have periodically conducted military exercises. \nAlthough South Korea has strong bilateral relations with the United States, the \ncountry has been involved in multiple incidents of government espionage and \nintelligence collection activities that have resulted in U.S criminal proceedings. South \nKorea is one of the most active countries involved in industrial espionage directed at the \nUnited States. \nThe South Korean Government generally respects human rights and the rule of \nlaw. Though persistent problems with discrimination against women, persons with \ndisabilities, and minorities, percolate occasionally, the country\u2019s record demonstrates \nthat it values the importance of human rights. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology;  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \n11 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. The potential \nfor foreign influence depends on the foreign country involved. The form of a country\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship to the United States, whether it is known to target U.S. \ncitizens for classified or sensitive information, and its human rights record, are relevant \nfactors in gauging the chances that an applicant\u2019s foreign family members are \nvulnerable to foreign influence. South Korea, a constitutional democracy, has been a \ndependable partner to the United states, although it has committed industrial espionage \nand intelligence collection activities against this country in the past. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, his three brothers-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and \nextended family members are citizens and residents of South Korea. Fourteen \nadditional contacts identified in SOR 1.f through 1.s are citizens of South Korea. The \npresence of Applicant\u2019s family and extended family members in South Korea creates a \nheightened risk of foreign influence and coercion and a potential conflict of interest. The \nheightened risk and conflict of interest is increased by the Korean citizenship of the 14 \nadditional contacts and Applicant\u2019s wife, who has been sharing a U.S. residence with \nApplicant for about 20 years. Their South Korea citizenship also establishes a conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to the circumstances of this case. Applicant\u2019s \nSouth Korean bank account, his retirement annuity generated by his employment at the \nSouth Korean law school, and his family\u2019s eligibility for medical benefits, could intensify \nthe heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7(f). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n12 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.  \nExcept for his wife, Applicant\u2019s ties to his South Korean family members and \ncontacts are occasional to non-existent. He has not communicated with his mother-in-\nlaw for three or four years. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s contact with her mother has been sporadic \nsince 2005. Though the record is silent on the identification of all the in-laws, Applicant \nhas had no contact with them because of the language barrier. His wife has had no \ncontact with any of them either.  \nFrom 2001 to 2006, Applicant worked as a professor for his cousin, a citizen \nand resident of South Korea, at the university law school. It is noted that Applicant\u2019s \ntestimonial claim that he performed no additional legal services for his cousin after \n2006, is at odds with the information he provided in his security clearance application \nindicating that the services did not cease until 2017. Based on the minimal level of \ncontact described by Applicant regarding his other relatives in his security clearance \napplication, Applicant\u2019s quarterly contacts with his cousin invokes insignificant \ncontinuing security concerns under the foreign influence guideline. \nHaving evaluated all the foreign contacts identified in SOR 1.f through 1.s, \nincluding the ten contacts with current or past backgrounds in the South Korean military \nor government, Applicant met most of the contacts at his U.S. church between 2010 and \n2014. Only SOR 1.g and 1.r met Applicant at other venues. All of the contacts returned \nto South Korea by 2018, and Applicant\u2019s contacts thereafter has been few and far \nbetween at best. \nSouth Korea, which has a close geopolitical relationship with United States, \noperates a constitutional government that maintains respect for human rights and the \nrule of law. It is very unlikely that the country would attempt to exert foreign influence or \ncoercion through one or more of Applicant\u2019s family or extended family members, or \ncontacts identified in SOR 1.f through 1.s, to Applicant. Except for the contacts identified \nat SOR 1.g, who met Applicant at his law firm, and SOR 1.r, who met Applicant through \na client, the other 12 contacts met Applicant at his U.S. church. None of the 14 contacts \never had professional or financial relationships with Applicant. Their return to South \nKorea by 2018, decreased the contact between Applicant and these individuals. While \nstill a citizen of South Korea, Applicant\u2019s wife has been a U.S. resident alien and living \nwith Applicant for the past 20 years. In sum, Applicant\u2019s current contact with these \nindividuals no longer raises security concerns. Applicant\u2019s periodic travel to South Korea \nraises minimal independent security concerns because the travel has been for \nlegitimate reasons that Applicant documented in his security clearance application. AG \n\u00b6 8(a) and 8(d) apply. \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1972 and, except for the teaching job \nin South Korea between 2001 and 2006, has lived and worked in this country the entire \n13 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntime. He graduated from an undergraduate university in 1994 and a law school in 1997. \nHe passed the bars in two states and has practiced law for at least 22 years. While still \na citizen of South Korea, his wife has been a U.S. resident alien and living with \nApplicant. He has two adult-aged children. As described by his character references, \nApplicant\u2019s ties and bonds to America are such that he can be expected to resolve any \npotential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s South Korean bank account and his future retirement annuity are \nproportionally much smaller than his U.S. assets. The large difference in value makes it \nextremely unlikely that the South Korean bank account and future annuity could be used \nas a source for coercion or influence. Furthermore, the medical benefit coverage \nexpired in December 2018. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence that portrays him as \na qualified attorney who follows the rules of professional responsibility, and has a \nreputation for being trustworthy. Considering the evidence as a whole, including \nApplicant\u2019s favorable credibility, I conclude that Applicant has overcome the security \nconcerns arising from the guidelines involving foreign influence and outside activities. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n_____________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline L:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a (That information set forth in 1.v): For Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 11, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines C (foreign \npreference) and L (outside activities). Applicant responded to the SOR on January 20, \n2021, and requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on February 22, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR by withdrawing the Guideline C allegations, \nadding Guideline B (foreign influence) allegations, and amending the Guideline L \nallegations. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on \nMarch 7, 2022.

The Government exhibits \nincluded in the FORM are admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel \nrequested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about Country A. Without \nobjection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this \ndecision. Of particular note is that the United States and Country A enjoy a long tradition \nof friendly relations based on democratic values and mutual respect. Country A is a co-\nfounder and steadfast strategic ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old part-time employee of a defense contractor. He has \nworked for that employer since 2019. He is married with two children. (Item 4-6) \nApplicant graduated from a military academy in 1979. He then served on active \nduty in the U.S. military until he retired with an honorable discharge as an O-6 in 2005. \nFrom 2005 to 2013, he worked for a U.S. company that provided consulting services to \na defense contractor from Country A. In 2013, he accepted a position as senior director \nof marketing for the same Country A defense contractor\u2019s U.S.-based affiliate company, \nwhich is owned by the parent company in Country A. The U.S.-based affiliate is a \nlimited liability company (LLC) that is registered in the United States. Applicant\u2019s duties \nhave included providing unclassified briefings to the United States and other allied \nnations on the capabilities of the company\u2019s weapons systems. He also traveled to \nother countries for trade shows and briefings. (Items 3-6) \nApplicant held a security clearance throughout his time in the U.S. military and \nwhile working for the U.S. company from 2005 to 2013. It lapsed when he left that \nemployment. He applied for a security clearance with Country A in 2013 and 2015, but it \nwas denied in 2017. (Items 3-6) \nIn 2019, Applicant accepted a part-time position with a U.S. defense contractor\nwhile continuing to hold his position with the Country A company\u2019s U.S. affiliate. The \nU.S. defense contractor has a contract with Country A to integrate the Country A \ncompany\u2019s weapons system into the U.S.-built F-35 aircraft. (Items 3-5) The F-35 is a \nfamily of fighter jets. It is made in the United States, but some parts and weapons are \nmade by various NATO and other allied countries who have bought the jets.\n \n1 \nApplicant stated that for him to properly address the U.S. DOD requirements for \nthe Country A company\u2019s product, he occasionally will need to attend classified \nmeetings. He is supporting the U.S. defense company as a weapons subject matter \nexpert for their contract with Country A. A security clearance will enable him to better \nserve the U.S. company in addressing U.S. Government requirements for integration \nand operation of a weapon from Country A into the F-35 aircraft.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nApplicant has worked since 2013 as senior director of marketing for a Country A \ndefense contractor\u2019s U.S. affiliate. His duties include providing unclassified briefings on \nthe capabilities of the company\u2019s weapons systems to the United States and other allied \nnations. He maintains contacts with business and professional associates who are \ncitizens and residents of Country A and are employed in the country\u2019s defense industry.  \nCountry A is a close ally of the United States and a founding member of NATO. \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s contacts with Country A are sufficient to create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant served many years in the U.S. military. His work appears to be \nprimarily related to the F-35, an aircraft that is made in the United States, but some \nparts and weapons are made by NATO and other allied countries who have bought the \njets. Collaboration between countries on that project is mandated and expected. \nI find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of Country A, as those \ninterests are closely aligned. I further find there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in America, that \nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nGuideline L, Outside Activities \nThe security concern for outside activities is set out in AG \u00b6 36: \nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of \nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s \nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized \ndisclosure of classified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 37. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: \n(1) the government of a foreign country; \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity; \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person \nengaged in analysis. \nApplicant has worked since 2013 as senior director of marketing for a Country A \ndefense contractor\u2019s U.S. affiliate. AG \u00b6 37(a) has been raised by the evidence. \nSOR \u00b6 1(b) alleges that Applicant \u201cdisplayed and marketed [Country A defense \ncontractor\u2019s] weapons systems to various international customers.\u201d While there is a \nslight difference between SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1(a) and 1(b) in that SOR \u00b6 1(a) alleges Applicant\u2019s \nwork for the U.S. affiliate, and SOR \u00b6 1(b) alleges his work on behalf of the parent \ncompany, since the affiliate is owned by the parent company and all of Applicant\u2019s work \nbenefits the parent company, I find the difference in the allegations is insignificant. I also \nfind that the work alleged in SOR \u00b6 1(b) is part of Applicant\u2019s responsibilities as an \nemployee of the U.S. affiliate, and is therefore already encompassed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate outside activities security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 38. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) evaluation of the outside employment or activity by the appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a \nconflict with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities or with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States; and \n(b) the individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security \nresponsibilities. \nApplicant is still employed by the U.S affiliate of a defense contractor from \nCountry A. AG \u00b6 38(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant main job is with the U.S affiliate. His part-time job is with the U.S. \ncompany that is sponsoring him for a security clearance. It appears that both jobs \ninvolve the F-35 aircraft. As indicated above, collaboration between countries on that \nproject is mandated and expected. Based upon the relationship between the United \nStates and Country A, its close ally, it is very possible that an appropriate security or \ncounterintelligence office would evaluate Applicant\u2019s employment and indicate that it \ndoes not pose a conflict with his security responsibilities or with the national security \ninterests of the United States. However, that has not been done in this case. AG \u00b6 38(a) \nis not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s many years of honorable service in support of our \nnational defense; the fact that Country A is a NATO member and close ally of the United \nStates; and the fact that the F-35 project involves many friendly countries. Applicant is \nthe type of individual who would normally pass through the security clearance process \nwithout incident. However, the adjudicative guidelines are there for a reason. I am duty \nbound to follow AG \u00b6 2(b), which requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns, but he did not mitigate the outside \nactivities security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline L: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a government contractor. She has worked for her current employer since about March 2021. She worked for another government contractor from 2016 until 2019 and another from 2019 until she started her current employment. She was awarded a high school diploma in 2007 and attended college for several years without earning an undergraduate degree. She was married from 2015 until her divorce in July 2019.

These delinquencies are a federal student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a credit-card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and four medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f). Approximately \n$32,000 of the delinquent debt in the SOR is for a student loan. Applicant admitted all of \nthe SOR allegations with additional comment. Her admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. The SOR allegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. (Answer; GE 1-4) \nApplicant claimed her financial issues resulted from underemployment and \nunemployment. She quit a job to provide assistance to an ill family member who \nrequired care. She went through a divorce in 2019. She and her boyfriend recently \nallowed her boyfriend\u2019s sibling to move in with them until he can \u201cget back on his feet.\u201d \nShe claimed that she only has enough income to pay one delinquent bill at a time. She \nacknowledged that she did not address her federal student loan appropriately when it \nfirst became due in about 2013 because she was immature. (Tr. 26, 29, 33, 35, 37; \nAnswer; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $2,300 per month. She is paid hourly and \nearns $22.15 per hour. From March 2019 until March 2021, she earned between $14.25 \nand $18 per hour. Her boyfriend, who resides with her, shares with household income \nand expenses. His take-home pay is about $2,700 per month. Applicant has $5,000 in a \nretirement account. She pays $450 per month in rent. She purchased a new Honda \ncrossover SUV in 2020 for $25,000. She pays $629 per month on that car note. Her \nlatest monthly electric bill was $430, and she pays $160 per month for her cell phone \nand internet. Her boyfriend pays $90 per month for child support and has a $400 \nmonthly car payment. He also pays $80 to $90 per month for insurance. She claimed \nthat at the end of the month, after paying all of her expenses, she has about $100 left \nover for savings. (Tr. 20-21, 26-29, 31, 43-45) \nIn about April 2021, Applicant inherited about $12,000 from her late grandmother. \nIn about June 2021, she inherited another $7,000 for a total inheritance of about \n$19,000. Applicant plans to use this inheritance to pay for a down payment on a house. \nHowever, there is no legal impediment to her using this inheritance for other purposes. \nAs a result of additional deposits that Applicant and her boyfriend have made into the \nchecking account containing the inheritance, this account holds a balance of about \n$23,000.

The payments on this debt became due in 2013, about a year \nafter Applicant stopped attending college. She did not make any payment on this debt \nor attempt to contact the creditor until about 2015. In 2015, she worked with a company \nnot affiliated with the Federal Government, and made payments of $100 per month for a \nyear. After that year, in about 2016, this company asked her to make a $1,600 payment \nto continue with their program, which she could not afford. She therefore discontinued \nmaking payments and did not attempt to remedy her delinquency on this debt until \nabout 2018. In 2018, she contacted the same company, but they still wanted a down \npayment that was more than she could afford. As of the hearing, she had yet to contact \nthe Department of Education to try to resolve her delinquency. (Tr. 32-36, 40-41; \nAnswer; GE 1-4; AE A) \nIn her post-hearing document submission, Applicant provided an undated \ndocument from the Department of Education reflecting that her student loans are not \ncurrently eligible for forgiveness or an income-driven repayment plan. I have taken \nadministrative notice that all federal student loans were eligible for placement in a \ndeferment status as of late March 2020 at the earliest. Therefore, available evidence \nshows that Applicant was delinquent on these debts prior to any placement in a \ndeferment status. This debt appears on the 2021 and 2020 credit reports with a last \nactivity date of May 2017. (Tr. 32-36, 40-41; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A) \nThe delinquent credit-card account in the amount of $4,467 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nhas not been resolved. Applicant claimed that she fell behind on this debt because of a \nlack of income due to underemployment and unemployment while she cared for a family \nmember who was ill. She stopped making payments on this debt in about May 2014. \nShe claimed that she contacted the creditor about another account she had with it and \npaid off that account, but has not made any effort to resolve this account. This debt \nappears on the 2020 and 2019 credit reports. (Tr. 36-38; Answer; GE 1, 3, 4) \nThe delinquent medical debts totaling about $3,400 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through \n1.f are being resolved. Applicant incurred these debts in 2016 when she had surgery \nwithout medical insurance. She claimed that she has been making payments on these \ndebts and provided documentation showing that she made monthly payments to a debt \ncollector from August 2021 until September 2022. This document also showed that she \nmade a $25 payment in January 2020 and a $100 payment in January 2021. She \nclaimed that the balance on these debts is about $900. These debts appear on the 2019 \ncredit report. (Tr. 38-39, 42; Answer; GE 1, 4; AE A) \nApplicant has a second delinquent federal student loan in the amount of about \n$30,000 that is not listed in the SOR.1 This account is also unresolved.

(Tr. 36, 41; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nIn late 2021, Applicant contacted an individual in order to help clear up her credit \nreport. She paid this person $150 to have her dispute the entries on her credit report \nregardless of whether she had a reasonable basis for her dispute. She engaged this \nindividual for about two months. She claimed that, as a result of this individual\u2019s help, \nher credit score rose, and some entries no longer appeared on her credit report. This \nindividual did not assist Applicant with budgeting. (Tr. 38-40, 42-43) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts, regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent debts, several of which have gone unresolved for years. \nHer unresolved federal student loan became delinquent in about 2013, and her \nunresolved credit-card account became delinquent in 2014. Since about June of 2021, \nshe has had about $19,000 in savings from an inheritance that she could have used to \naddress her delinquent debts, but she has not done so. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfederal-student-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), thereby shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted both from conditions within her control \nand beyond her control. Her unemployment, underemployment, and need to take care \nof a sick family member were beyond her control. Her failure to address her federal \nstudent loan when it became due because she was immature was within her control. \nThere is sufficient evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f are \nbeing resolved through payment. While Applicant began making consistent payments \non these debts after the SOR was issued, she made fairly substantial monthly payments \nfor a little over a year and reduced the balance on these debts by about 75 percent. I \nfind in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to these debts. \nApplicant has only sporadically addressed her federal student loans. A security \nclearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of \nnational secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a \ndirect bearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nthese debts are in a deferment status because of the pandemic, Applicant had already \ndefaulted on them prior to the deferment.

Despite earlier efforts, she made no attempt to resolve these student \nloans from about 2018 until this time. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June \n7, 2021). An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). The \ntiming of her renewed effort to address these debts undermines her ability to show that \nshe acted in good faith or responsibly under the circumstances. Even after contacting \nthe Department of Education, she has not provided evidence that she has a viable plan \nto address these debts. \nApplicant has largely ignored the credit-card account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b for \nabout eight years. She has not presented evidence as to how she plans to resolve this \ndebt. She has not acted in good faith or responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to resolving this debt. \nApplicant sought assistance with her credit from an individual she contacted after \nthe SOR was issued. While this individual helped Applicant with her credit score by \ndisputing credit entries, there is no evidence that this individual was a legitimate and \ncredible source of financial counseling. In actuality, this individual\u2019s method of disputing \ncredit entries regardless of having a good-faith basis for the dispute tends to show her \nform of counseling was neither legitimate nor credible. \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved delinquent accounts detract from her ability to show that \nher financial problems are under control. They also provide evidence that her financial \nproblems are ongoing. She arguably has sufficient funds to address her delinquent \naccounts, but plans on using these funds for other purposes. As she made either no or \nuntimely resolution effort with the majority of her financial delinquencies, she has not \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or in good faith with respect to her \ndelinquent debts. I find that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are unmitigated and continue to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The record in this case \nclosed 1 April 2021, when Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to the FORM.

He denied the \namount of child support arrears (SOR 1.h), documenting that the amount had been \nreduced to $876, and denied the debt at SOR 1.i as having been paid, which it had been \nin January 2020 [Answer (Item 3)]. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old engineering technician employed by a U.S. defense \ncontractor since January 2019. Before that employment, he had been employed since \nJune 2008 in a series of low skill, low wage jobs, interrupted occasionally by periods of \nvarying-length unemployment. He has never married, although he is currently engaged, \nand has an eight-year-old daughter from a prior relationship. He has not previously held \na clearance (Item 4). \nApplicant disclosed on his security clearance application his failures to file and pay \nhis 2017 tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.b), his delinquent child support (SOR 1.h), and the SOR \n1.i debt (for which he claimed to have been in a payment plan). The SOR 1.i debt had \nbeen reduced to judgment, apparently being enforced by garnishment. However, the SOR \ndebt amount alleged was only $24, and Applicant documented his January 2020 payment \n(Item 3) paying off the account. Applicant discussed his failures to file and pay, and all \nthe SOR debts, during his August 2019 interview with a Government investigator (Item \n5), based on his July 2019 credit report (Item 6). He attributed his failure to timely file his \nstate and Federal income tax returns for 2017 to not getting his tax information from his \ntwo employers that year. He stated that he had not gotten these records until April or May \n2019, and intended to file this delinquent return during the 2020 tax season, more than \nsix months away. His child support issues arose because, while he was with the child\u2019s \nmother when his daughter was born in September 2013, they were not together when the \nmother filed for child support in May 2014, and when child support is awarded \nretroactively, there is initially never a time when the payer is not delinquent, and the \nenforcement system garnishes the payer\u2019s wages, including an amount for arrears. \nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s Answer documents his regular payments and reduction of his \noutstanding arrears. \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated he filed the missing returns in July 2020, however, \nhe did not fax his returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the state until after \nhe received the SOR in November 2020. His Answer states he used his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s credit \ncards to pay his tax debts, and his fianc\u00e9e states that Applicant repaid the amounts \nadvanced (Response). \nApplicant\u2019s sole character reference (Response) praises Applicant\u2019s work, but \nevinces no knowledge of the SOR issues. He documented no credit or financial \ncounseling, and did not submit a budget.

Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00a7 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his 2017 \nstate and Federal income tax returns. Accepting that he did not have the necessary \nrecords until April or May 2019, he has given no credible reason for waiting until the 2020 \ntax season, the claimed July 2020 filing, or the actual November 2020 filing, which was \nafter he received the SOR. He documented belated efforts to address his delinquent \ntaxes.3 \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3\u00a719(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.4 \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful5 or attributed to the press of family \ncircumstances.6 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00a7 19(g) explicitly provides that failure to \nfile tax returns is a circumstance that can raise a security \nconcern. Moreover, the Directive presumes a nexus between \nadmitted or proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04648 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. \n14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd.

His failures \nto timely file his Federal taxes are recent, and may not be demonstrated to be unlikely to \nrecur.8 Accepting that Applicant\u2019s failure to file was justified because his employers did \nnot provide him the required documentation, there is no record of any efforts to obtain the \ndocumentation before 2019. Tax documents for 2017 would have been due by the end of \nJanuary 2018. Without an extension, tax filings were due in April 2018; October 2018 with \nextension. Consequently, Applicant was not responsible in addressing his taxes. He knew \nhis taxes were delinquent when he completed his clearance application; he knew his \ntaxes were delinquent when he met with the Government investigator. Yet, he did not act \non his promises to address his taxes, and did so apparently only when his clearance was \nat risk. 9 However, he appears to have successfully resolved his state income tax \nissues. 10 Nevertheless, what he has not done is demonstrate a track record of \nresponsibly dealing with his taxes going forward. \nThe circumstances of this case do not suggest that Applicant would benefit from \ncredit or financial counseling, but his taxes appear to have been resolved to date.11 \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s tardy contacts with the IRS cannot be considered a good-faith effort \nto address his taxes,12 to the extent that this mitigating condition could be considered \napplicable. Moreover, Applicant had mostly disregarded these tax obligations since at \nleast 2019, when he began applying for a clearance. His documented inaction for at least \nanother year, to 2020, when he filed the delinquent returns raises significant security \nconcerns that Applicant has not addressed by the flurry of activity triggered by his receipt \nof the SOR.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of August 20, 2021, Applicant owed six charged-off debts totaling $17,617 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e-1.g, and 1.i-1.j), and eight collection debts totaling $11,337 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.h, and 1.k-1.n). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged accounts were delinquent but indicated that the original amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was $80 less than the amount alleged. He stated that he had previously made payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; was on payment plans for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.i, and 1.k-1.l; and had paid off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n. He asserted that once the debts in payment plans were resolved, he would resume payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and begin payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.j.

Yet some concerns about his financial stability persist. Clearance \neligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 20, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations on a date not clear in the record. He \nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On December 14, 2021, \nthe Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a statement of \nthe Government\u2019s position and seven documents pre-marked as Item 1 through Item 7. \nThe SOR and Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Items 1 and 2, respectively. \nApplicant received the FORM on December 20, 2021. He responded that a security \nclearance was not needed to fulfill his current job duties. On being informed that his \nemployer was still sponsoring him for security clearance eligibility, on January 4, 2022, \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn February 23, 2022, Applicant requested an expedited hearing. On February 24, \n2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I \nreceived the case file and assignment on March 1, 2022. On March 3, 2022, I scheduled a \nvideo conference hearing to be held via Microsoft Teams on April 5, 2022. \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and four Applicant exhibits (AE \nA- D), including Applicant\u2019s extensive response to the SOR as AE A, were admitted in \nevidence. The Government offered as GE 5 a summary of a November 2018 personal \nsubject interview (PSI). Applicant objected to its admission, and it was not accepted into \nevidence for lack of authentication under E3.1.30 of the Directive. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on April 13, 2022. \nI held the record open after the hearing for additional documentation from Applicant. \nOver the April 7-8, 2022 timeframe, Applicant submitted documentation that was admitted \nwithout objections as AE E through AE P. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of August 20, 2021, Applicant owed six charged-off debts \ntotaling $17,617 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e-1.g, and 1.i-1.j), and eight collection debts totaling \n$11,337 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.h, and 1.k-1.n). When Applicant answered the SOR, he \nadmitted the alleged accounts were delinquent but indicated that the original amount of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was $80 less than the amount alleged. He stated that he had previously \nmade payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; was on payment plans for the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.i, and 1.k-1.l; and had paid off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and \n1.n. He asserted that once the debts in payment plans were resolved, he would resume \npayments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and begin payments on the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.j.

(GE 1.) He has held a DOD security clearance for over 16 years with no security \nviolations. (Tr. 67.) He took classes at two local community colleges between May 2008 \nand May 2013, and he earned a certificate. (GE 1.) \nApplicant and his ex-wife divorced in August 2017 after four plus years of marriage. \nHis ex-wife has primary residential custody of their two daughters, now age 6 and age 11. \n(GE 1; AE A.) Applicant has two other daughters, age 2 and age 7 months, with his \nfianc\u00e9e. They have had a cohabitant relationship since about October 2019. (Tr. 50, 54.) \nIn July 2013, Applicant purchased the home that he shared with his now ex-wife. He \nobtained a first mortgage of $153,174 and a second mortgage of $12,345. He made his \nmortgage payments on the primary loan through May 2017 and on the other loan through \nJune 2017. (GEs 3-4.) In July 2017, he and his ex-wife separated permanently, and he \nmoved in with his mother for about a month before renting an apartment. (GE 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife was given the marital home in the divorce. (GE 1; AE A.) As of \nAugust 2017, the monthly payment obligation on the first mortgage was $1,097. (GE 4.) \nApplicant was required to pay the expenses of the property, including the mortgages, only \nthrough June 30, 2017. Thereafter, his ex-wife was solely obligated to pay the mortgage \nloans, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utility expenses for the property. The court gave \nher five years to refinance the property and obtain a mortgage in her name. Applicant was \nto be removed from liability for any debt related to the property within five years of their \ndivorce. (AE A.) She made no payments on the mortgages. (GEs 3-4.) The house \u201cwent \nunder,\u201d and Applicant asserts he could do nothing about the situation, as he had been \nrequired in the divorce to deed the property to his ex-wife, who abandoned the property. \n(Tr. 26.) As of August 2017, the primary mortgage was listed as having a zero balance on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report after transfer. However, the second mortgage was still affecting his \ncredit. As of November 2017, that mortgage loan was $323 past due on a balance of \n$11,378. (GE 4.). \nAt the time of their divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife agreed that he would pay $291 \nper week in child support starting July 7, 2017, and that they each would pay half of the \ncost of work-related or camp daycare and medical expenses for their children. Regarding \nfinancial liabilities, Applicant and his ex-wife assumed responsibility for the debts incurred \nseparately or in their respective names. They agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the \nother from any liability arising for the failure to pay a debt, and to terminate any joint \naccounts. (AE A.) \nApplicant had been current on his financial obligations before his divorce, (Tr. 39, \n41.) He stopped paying on several of his consumer credit obligations in the summer of \n2017 because he could not afford to pay them as he had his divorce attorney\u2019s fees \ntotaling some $10,000; his child support payment; and his living expenses, which included \nrent. (Tr. 36, 43.) His annual income in 2017 was less than $60,000.

He indicated on his SF 86 that \na credit management company was assisting him in eliminating all but one of his credit-\ncard debts (including the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f-1.i, and 1.l). Under a section for \nadditional comments, Applicant stated that his ex-wife was supposed to pay the mortgage \non the marital residence, but that it was continuing to adversely affect his credit and his \ncredit score. (GE 1.) Applicant now discrepantly recalls that he contacted the credit \nmanagement company in late 2017 and that the company was handling only two or three \nof his credit-card delinquencies, including the account in SOR \u00b6 1.j. (Tr. 45.) \nApplicant paid the credit management company $267 per month for several months \nbut less than one year before he terminated its service in October 2018 because he saw \nno progress in the reduction of his debts. He believes the company was holding onto his \nmoney until debts dropped from his credit report. (Tr. 44-47.) He began contacting his \ncreditors on his own to arrange for repayment. (Tr. 46.) \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s accounts were delinquent by December 2017, including a \ncouple of debts not alleged in the SOR. (GE 4.)

He asserts that she was supposed to pay him half of the loan and never \ndid. (Tr. 42.) The account was charged off for $9,990 in July 2018 because of no payments \nafter March 2018.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. One or more of the credit reports in evidence \nestablishes the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, although the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \nand 1.n were paid in June 2021, before the SOR was issued. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. \nAt his hearing, Applicant credibly testified that he owes delinquent federal income \ntaxes totaling about $20,000 for tax years 2017 through 2020. He had insufficient funds \nwithheld from his pay for taxes and then did not have the funds to pay the taxes with his \nreturns because of his sizeable child support obligation. Although the information was \napparently unknown to the DOD before Applicant\u2019s hearing, Department Counsel asked \nthat it be considered under the whole-person evaluation and did not move to amend the \nSOR to include the debt as an issue of security concern under Guideline F.

However, conduct not alleged \nmay be considered for limited purposes, such as assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; \nconsidering whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or providing \nevidence for the whole-person assessment. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006). In that regard, Applicant\u2019s income tax delinquency is relevant in assessing \nmitigation of the financial concerns and the whole-person assessment of his judgment. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his failure to meet several of his \nfinancial obligations according to contractual terms. AG \u00b6 20 provides for mitigation under \none or more of the following conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWith respect to AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant\u2019s divorce, which largely caused his financial \ndifficulties, is a circumstance that is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(b) also applies in that his \nability to remain current on his debts was compromised by his sizeable child support \nobligation and some $10,000 in legal fees for his divorce. Applicant was largely current on \nhis financial obligations before his divorce. \nThe recency of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies and his delay in addressing several debts \nweigh against him in terms of finding full mitigation under AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b), \nhowever. Applicant is credited with paying $267 per month for several months in 2018 to a \ncredit management company. He cannot be faulted for the firm\u2019s failure to perform. \nHowever, he indicated on his SF 86 that the company was going to address all of his debts \nfor him. According to his hearing testimony, the company was handling at most three \naccounts. He terminated the services of the company around October 2018, but then did \nlittle to address his debts before June 2021.

Yet, it is \ndifficult to conclude that he acted fully responsibly toward his SOR creditors in 2019 and \n2020. A component of sound financial judgment is whether an individual remains in contact \nwith his or her creditors and attempts to settle balances in full or under terms agreed by his \nor her creditors. There is no evidence that Applicant made any payments toward any of the \nSOR debts in 2019 or 2020. Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e had their first child two years ago, so \neither in 2019 or early 2020, but I cannot speculate as to the financial impact of her birth \nand care. Applicant provided no details in that regard. He did not begin to establish a track \nrecord of payments toward his past-due debts until June 2021. With respect to some of the \ndebts, including his two largest (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), he made $60 and $67 weekly \npayments in June 2021, but then paid nothing from July 2021 through December 2021 \nbefore resuming payments at $10 a week in January 2022. \nAGs \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have some applicability. In June 2021, Applicant resolved the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n. In December 2021, he satisfied a credit-card collection debt \nthat went to judgment (SOR \u00b61.h) and a credit-card collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). He paid off \na cable/Internet services debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) in February 2022. He made consistent \npayments since June 2021 to significantly reduce the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c to \nwhere that debt will soon be paid off. He also demonstrated a sufficient track record of \npayments since the summer of 2021 on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.i. Favorable \nfindings are warranted as to those debts that have been paid off or have been substantially \nreduced through payments. \nApplicant has been paying on other debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.j) regularly only \nsince January 2022. He has made weekly payments since January 24, 2022, on a credit-\ncard debt owed to a home-improvement retailer. While he believes those payments are \nbeing made on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.g, available credit reports indicate that the account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.g is instead a gasoline credit-card debt on which there is no evidence of \npayments. He has not made any payments on the joint debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nApplicant is not required to pay off each of his delinquent debts to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. Indeed, the first debts paid off may be other than those alleged in an \nSOR. He has demonstrated good faith of late towards his creditors. Nevertheless, some \nconcerns persist about his financial judgment and stability. He has only $148 in checking \ndeposits and no savings, despite paying only $200 in rent to his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents. After \npayments from January 2022 to early April 2022, he owes approximately $9,640 on the \ndefaulted loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $3,007 to his former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.b); about $1,895 on the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d; $2,225 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e; about $1,490 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f; possibly the full balance of $1,245 on the gasoline credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.g; \n$593 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i; and $942 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. He reports unpaid \nbalances of $739 and $898 on two unalleged past-due accounts that are in repayment. He \nowes the IRS $20,000 for tax years 2017 through 2020. His credit report from December \n2021 shows a history of late payments on his car loan, which was again past due in \nNovember 2021. A second car loan was $300 past due as of October 2021. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial stress was recently alleviated somewhat by the modification in \nhis child support obligation from $457 to $391 per week in February 2022, although his \nmonthly installment payment to the IRS increased by $25 to $50 last month. The payoff of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c will free up another $41 per week that he plans to put towards his \nother delinquencies. Even so, given the repayment plans that are currently established, it is \ngoing to take years for Applicant to pay off his remaining delinquencies. At $10 a week, it \nwill take years for Applicant to resolve the credit union debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are partially mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant is a longtime defense-contractor employee whose financial situation \ndeteriorated because of the mitigating circumstances of his divorce and court-mandated \nchild support. Yet, the evidence shows that Applicant took on more debt, including loans for \n$5,733 and $11,266, when most of his old delinquencies had not been satisfied. His \nsizeable federal income tax delinquency is an additional financial burden, which raises \nconcerns about his financial judgment. Most of his income tax debt was incurred for tax \nyears 2017 through 2019, when he was making no payments toward his old delinquencies \nand was behind in his child support, so those obligations do not fully explain his inability to \npay his taxes. Applicant asserts that any future tax refunds will be applied to his \noutstanding federal tax delinquency of some $20,000. Even so, I have to make a decision \non the record presently before me. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has been \nmarried since 2005. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 1989. Since 2019, he has \nbeen working for a defense contractor as a custodian.

As of the date of the SOR, \napproximately $49,000 of this debt constitutes a child support arrearage, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a. (Item 1 at 1) Approximately $4,000 of this debt constitutes delinquent \nmedical debt owed to the same hospital.

(Item 5 \nat 5) \nIn February 2021, one month after the SOR issuance, Applicant consulted a debt \nrelief agency to help him settle his debts. (Item 2 at 15-20) With the help of the debt relief \nagency, he organized a payment plan. It includes debts that were not listed in the SOR, \nincluding an $8,829 hospital bill. (Item 2 at 16) Under the program, which is expected to \nlast 50 months, Applicant is to make monthly payments of $325. (Item 2 at 20) He provided \nno documentation of any payment chronology. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nBecause Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant did not specifically address whether his debts were caused by \ncircumstances beyond his control. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe condition that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant retained a debt relief agency to help him organize a payment plan to \nresolve the debts. However, he provided no evidence of any progress with debt reduction. \nConsequently, AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable, in that he is receiving help, but I cannot \nconclude that there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol,\u201d given the lack of evidence of progress. \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s initiation of a debt-payment plan triggers the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(d) that credits applicants for organizing good-faith payment plans. However, the second \nprong, relating to whether the applicant is adhering to the plan, is inapplicable. None of the \nremaining mitigating conditions are relevant to the analysis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI was troubled by Applicant\u2019s child support delinquency. Failure to abide by the legal \nand ethical obligation to support one\u2019s children is particularly egregious. Having considered \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of the whole-person concept, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n4 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2019. \n(Item 3) On March 24, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E. (Item 1) The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 10, 2022 (Item 2), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 3, 2022, Applicant subsequently \nrequested a decision on the record without a hearing, and the Government did not object \nto the conversion. (Item 1) Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non April 26, 2022. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to \n1 \n\n \n \nApplicant, including documents identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 7, 2022, but he did not provide \nadditional information after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 36, is not married and has one minor child. He graduated from high \nschool in May 2001. Applicant attended some college courses from 2012 to 2016, but he \ndid not obtain a degree. He worked for his current employer since 2019. Applicant \nreported no unemployment. He served in the U.S. Navy (active reserve from 2002 to \n2005.) He completed a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2019. (Item 3) \nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) sets forth security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E. The SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a through 1.r under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) lists 18 \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $44,000. (Items 5, 6) Under Guideline E, the SOR \nalleges under SOR 2.a, that Applicant falsified his June 19, 2019 SCA by not disclosing \nhis financial delinquencies in response to Section 26 of the SCA. (Item 2) \nFinancial \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all of the allegations under \nGuideline F and Guideline E, but he claimed that he has paid or is paying each of the \naccounts alleged. He provided no explanations in that answer. His 2020 and 2021 credit \nreports support the Guideline F allegations. (Items 5 and 6) The delinquent debts included \nconsumer loans, medical accounts, and student loans. \nIn his 2019 subject interview, Applicant responded to questioning concerning his \nother military service. He explained that he was in the state National Guard from 2006 \nuntil 2011. He was discharged from the National Guard. He also stated that he had Army \nservice. He could not remember dates of service or any other details. The record reveals \nthat in 2006, Applicant received a clearance from the Army, with warning. (Item 7) \nApplicant \u2018s financial delinquencies on his credit reports were discussed. Applicant stated \nthat he had consolidated his student loans into a payment plan and is currently making \nmonthly payments of $86. (Item 4) \nApplicant explained that for the remaining consumer and medical accounts listed \non the SOR, he had no knowledge of them. (Item 4) In essence, he provided no \nexplanation for his indebtedness, or why his response was reasonable. \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s annual income or \nbudget. It does not appear that he has sought financial counseling. He reported no \ncircumstances beyond his control. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was asked after his subject interview to provide documentation or \nstatements from creditors, receipts, or agreements. However, he did not provide any of \nthe requested information. (Item 4) \nPersonal Conduct \nAs to SOR 2.a, it was alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his June 19, \n2019 SCA by responding \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26-Financial Record Delinquency that he had \nno delinquent bills in the last seven years or had defaulted or failed to pay as agreed. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to all sub-items. (Item 3) Applicant admitted the allegation and \ndid not discuss it in his answer or subject interview. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) . \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has unresolved delinquent debts that are \nnot paid. The debts are recent. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant reported no circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation of obtaining financial counseling or evidence of any good-faith efforts to \nshow what he has done to address the debts. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR due to insufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find he has not \nmitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable national security \neligibility determination, security clearance action, or cancellation of further \nprocessing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n5 \n\n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination. \n \n \n \n16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his financial issues on his SCA and \nadmitting such in his SOR answer, I conclude he intentionally falsified his SCA. He \nprovided no excuse for this conduct. He received a security clearance with warning in \n2006 based on financial issues. He was aware of the financial concerns. \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn this instance, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with\nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n6 \n\n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply in \nthis case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s military service, I conclude that \nApplicant has not presented evidence of mitigation under either guideline. Clearance is \ndenied. \n7 \n\n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n\u00b6 1, Guideline F Financial Considerations): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1:a-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n\u00b6 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information under the financial consideration \nguideline or the personal conduct security concerns guideline.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o and 1.q. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.p. She provided narrative statements with her answers. Her admissions and statements are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 66 years old. She has a high school diploma and some other schooling. She was married for 32 years, from 1986 until her husband died in July 2018. She has two adult daughters. She worked as a cleared employee of another federal government agency (AGA) for forty years, from 1976 until August 2016, when she retired as GS-8, step 10, with a salary of about $62,000. (Tr. 12-13, 45-47) She lived in State 1 from 1987 to 2016, until moving to State 2 shortly after she retired. She was unemployed until February 2017, when she began working for a federal contractor, her current sponsor for a clearance. She works on a DOD facility, but is contracted to the same federal agency from which she retired in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 45-50, 89) The SOR alleges over $230,000 in past-due federal student loans, bank or credit card debts of about $4,300, and some past-due state tax debt.

While her financial issues worsened due to \nfamily circumstances beyond her control, she does not have a reasonable plan to \nresolve her debts, and has not made progress towards resolving them. She did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns arising from her delinquent \ndebts.

The case \nwas first assigned to another DOHA administrative judge on March 16, 2022. On April \n20, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing to be held in person on May 16, \n2022, at a location near where Applicant lives and works. The case was assigned to me \non May 10, 2022, after the initial administrative judge became unavailable to hear the \ncase. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6. GE 1 through 5 were admitted without objection. GE 6 was \nalso admitted without objection, though page 8 of the document was excluded. (Tr. 27-\n28) Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open until May 31, 2022, to enable \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documents. She submitted documents \nthat were marked as AE I through N and admitted without objection. She subsequently \nsubmitted additional status updates by e-mail on June 6, 2022 and June 29, 2022. \nThose e-mails are marked as AE O and AE P, respectively, and included in the record. \nThe record closed on June 29, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 24, \n2022. \nJurisdiction \nApplicant is employed by a U.S. government contractor. The cabinet department \nthat oversees the federal agency where she works has an agreement with DOD \nestablishing DOHA jurisdiction over the case. See Directive 5220.6 at \u00b6 2.2. Applicant \nalso works on a DOD facility. (Tr. 48-49) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o and 1.q. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.p. She \nprovided narrative statements with her answers. Her admissions and statements are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 66 years old. She has a high school diploma and some other \nschooling. She was married for 32 years, from 1986 until her husband died in July 2018. \nShe has two adult daughters. She worked as a cleared employee of another federal \ngovernment agency (AGA) for forty years, from 1976 until August 2016, when she \nretired as GS-8, step 10, with a salary of about $62,000. (Tr. 12-13, 45-47) She lived in \nState 1 from 1987 to 2016, until moving to State 2 shortly after she retired. She was \nunemployed until February 2017, when she began working for a federal contractor, her \ncurrent sponsor for a clearance. She works on a DOD facility, but is contracted to the \nsame federal agency from which she retired in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 45-50, 89) \nThe SOR alleges over $230,000 in past-due federal student loans, bank or credit \ncard debts of about $4,300, and some past-due state tax debt.

(GE 1, GE 2) Applicant\u2019s debts are detailed on the credit reports \nin the record, from May 2019, March 2020, and March 2022. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4). \nApplicant testified that in the mid-1990s, her husband began acting erratically, \nexhibiting symptoms of what was later diagnosed as bipolar disorder or manic \ndepression. He stopped working and began making large family decisions unilaterally, \nsuch as moving the family into his mother\u2019s house. He assumed the mortgage for that \nhome after his mother died, in about 1999-2000, but did not pay the mortgage. He also \nquit his job without Applicant\u2019s knowledge. Their young daughters also had a traumatic \nexperience at school, and Applicant\u2019s sister was diagnosed with a chronic disease \nrequiring continuing care. (Tr. 37-40, 53-58, 92; Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s troubles continued and he began taking out loans without \nher knowledge. His paycheck was garnished to address those loans. Applicant took out \nstudent loans to pay for her daughters\u2019 education, expecting that her husband\u2019s income \nwould help pay them back. (Tr. 40; Answer) \nApplicant, her husband, and her younger daughter moved to State 2 after she \nretired from federal service in 2016 because of the high cost of living in State 1. They \nmoved into a home owned by Applicant\u2019s brother and his wife. Applicant took the job as \na federal contractor on a U.S. government facility to support her husband and his \nmedical expenses. His health deteriorated and he died in 2018. At the same time, she \nwas contacted by student loan creditors asking for increased payments she could not \nafford. (Tr. 40-42, 89-90; Answer) \nApplicant was doing her best to pay her bills. She also had to purchase a new \ncar when her car died, and the new car was totaled in an accident in State 1 while she \nwas there for her daughter\u2019s wedding. She used her federal retirement payments to pay \nfor the car. Student loan payments have been on hold due to the COVID-19 \nmoratorium. (Tr. 41-42) \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 2009. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in September 2014. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant paid about \n$60,000 into the bankruptcy plan, about $1,500 per month. She kept her federal \nemployer\u2019s security office appropriately informed during the process. (GE 5; Tr. 50-52, \n58-62, 103-105; Answer) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($54,010); 1.d ($53,061); 1.e ($51,333); 1.f ($27,326); 1.g ($23,531); \n1.h ($19,875); 1.i ($18,038); and 1.j ($11,005) are all federal student loans that \nApplicant took out for her daughter\u2019s college education. (GE 3) The credit reports in the \nrecord show that she took out the loans between 2011 and 2014 while her bankruptcy \ncase was pending. (GE 2 \u2013 GE 5) They are all still listed as past due on an April 2022 \ncredit report. (GE 4) Interest of $17,335 on her student loans accrued in 2019. (AE N) \nApplicant said the last time she made any payments was in early 2020. She said the \ngovernment stopped accepting payments under the COVID-19 moratorium. She said \nshe was paying on the loans before then, as money was taken out of her pay and her \ngovernment annuity. All told, about $1,300 to $1,400 per month was going towards \nstudent loan payments before the moratorium.

(Tr. 63-72, 95-102; \nAnswer)  \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided paystubs from her employer from 2019 and \n2020, showing garnishments of her pay of between $205 and $256 per paycheck \ntowards her student loans, until June 2020, when none is shown. (AE J, AE K, AE O, \nAE P) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a $2,000 delinquent state tax debt from tax year 2015, owed to \nState 1. The debt owed is now approximately $4,800 due to interest. Applicant paid \n$2,000 in early 2022, and is on a $254 per month payment plan for the next 12 months. \n(Tr. 72-76; AE E, AE H) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($968), 1.m ($764), and 1.q ($400) are consumer debts to a bank. \nApplicant provided some documentation from early 2021 about two of these debts (AE \nB and AE C) and indicated in her answer that she would resolve them. She had not \nmade any payments towards these accounts by the hearing date. (Tr. 78) They remain \nlisted as past due on an April 2022 credit report. (GE 4 at 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($801) is a consumer debt to another bank. Applicant paid the debt off \nin February 2021. (Answer; AE A) An April 2022 credit report shows that the account \nwas charged off but now has a zero balance. (GE 4 at 12) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($545) is a consumer debt to a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.o ($439) is a credit \naccount with a department store. SOR \u00b6 1.p ($406) is a credit account with a bank. All \nthree debts are still listed as past-due as of April 2022. (GE 5 at 18) \nApplicant participated in credit counseling many years ago and also during the \nbankruptcy. (Tr. 87-88) She testified that she has every intention of paying on her debts. \nShe said it is not easy to get correct contact information for many of her consumer \ncreditors and collection agencies. (Tr. 80-83; AE I, AE O, AE P) Her first financial \npriority after her husband died was to pay funeral costs and to pay back loans from \nfamily members. (Tr. 80-83) She plans to keep working for another five years and \npaying her debts, and then retire back to State 1 to be near her daughter. (Tr. 107-108) \nApplicant earns $28 an hour in her job. (Tr. 94) She reported a monthly net \nannuity of $3,205 in federal retirement. She receives about $3,030 in net monthly \nincome from her job. On a personal financial statement prepared for the hearing, she \nreported multiple credit card accounts she was paying down, most with balances of less \nthan $1,000. She also has a car payment of $338. No payments towards her SOR debts \nare indicated. (AE D, AE F) \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law wrote letters of reference. They noted the \nmany family hardships Applicant has endured. They regard Applicant as honest, \ntrustworthy, and patriotic. She is also kind, loyal, caring, and dependable, and she has a \nmoral character.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out, in pertinent part, in \nAG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. She and her late husband filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009, and her debts continued after the bankruptcy was \ndischarged in 2014. She incurred several hundred thousand dollars in federal student \nloan debts financing her daughters\u2019 college education, as well as multiple consumer \ncredit debts, all far beyond her ability to pay them. Her financial situation was worsened \nby tragic life circumstances. Her husband\u2019s bipolar depression and other medical issues \nimpacted his judgment, employability and financial stability, and she moved to a new, \nmore affordable state after she retired from federal service. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(g) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a long history of financial instability. She and her husband filed \nbankruptcy in 2009, and their 2014 bankruptcy discharge did little to change their \nfinancial trajectory.

The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) unquestionably \napplies. Full application, however, requires reasonable action under the circumstances. \nApplicant took some steps to improve the family finances, most notably by moving to \nState 2, moving into a home owned by her family members, and taking a new job after \n40 years of federal employment. However, while the bankruptcy case was pending, she \nalso took out several hundred thousand dollars in federal student loans to fund her \ndaughters\u2019 college education. While this was well-intended, she acknowledged that she \nknew she could not afford the loans, fell behind in repayments, and has not established \nany responsible repayment plan. For a time before the pandemic, her wages and \nannuity payments were being garnished for the loan repayments, but this is currently on \nhold due to the federal government\u2019s repayment moratorium, begun at the start of the \npandemic, in early 2020. Applicant has also made little showing of efforts to repay her \nconsumer debts. What is needed to establish reasonable effort and good-faith is a track \nrecord of steady payments towards her debts, or at least a responsible plan, and active \nsteps taken towards putting that plan into place. That is not shown here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(d) do not fully apply. \nApplicant participated in credit counseling many years ago and again during the \nbankruptcy, but her debts are not being resolved and are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s State 1 tax debt concerns a single tax year, 2015, during the time \nwhen her life in State 1 was being uprooted by her husband\u2019s medical condition and \nrelated circumstances. She paid $2,000 towards the debt and has a reasonable plan in \nplace to resolve the rest. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. In particular, I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlong career as a cleared employee with a federal agency as weighing in her favor. But \nthat background is not enough to overcome the overwhelming evidence of long-term, \nongoing financial issues that continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and overall \neligibility for access to classified information. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate security concerns arising from her delinquent debts.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m - 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nMs. X and her sister returned to the apartment a short time later. Ms. X related to \nthe police that Applicant let them in. Her sister was helping move items out of the \nhouse. While she was outside, Applicant took out a handgun, pulled Ms. X to the living \nroom, pushed her to the couch, and pointed the gun at her head. He let her go several \nminutes later, and she ran out of the apartment. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nMs. X\u2019s sister told the police that in the morning, she heard loud banging coming \nfrom downstairs. When she went downstairs, she saw Applicant trying to push her half-\nnaked sister out the door. They left the apartment. After they returned, as they were \ngathering Ms. X\u2019s belongings, the sister saw a handgun in the nightstand in Applicant\u2019s \nand her sister\u2019s bedroom. The sister left the apartment with some of Ms. X\u2019s clothes. \nThe door locked when she left. The sister pounded on the door until Ms. X came \nrunning out saying they had to leave immediately.

Ms. X gave them permission to search the apartment. They \nfound an unregistered semi-automatic pistol in the nightstand drawer. It was unloaded, \nbut a magazine with nine rounds of ammunition was also in the nightstand. An extra \nempty magazine and ten more rounds were found in the closet. The police took pictures \nof everything, including what they described as bruises or abrasions on Ms. X\u2019s right \ncalf and right knee.

The \narrest also included a charge of having an unregistered firearm, but the prosecution did \nnot pursue that charge. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 12) \nA restraining order was issued forbidding Applicant from contacting Ms. X. He \nwas arrested in August 2014 for violating the order. Applicant denied violating the order, \nand the charge was dismissed. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 12) \nMs. X was at the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office on March 3, 2015, preparing for \ntrial. A member of the prosecution team noticed that she had bruising on her arms and \nlegs. The police were called and interviewed Ms. X. A victim witness advocate was \npresent during the interview. (GE 5) \nMs. X told the police that Applicant was her boyfriend. She reported that she was \nat his apartment on March 2, 2015, when they got in an argument at about 0800 over \nlaundry. He yelled at her, and she pushed him to get him out of her face. He pushed \nher, causing her to fall backwards on her elbows. He also punched her in the thigh. The \npolice officer reported bruises on Ms. X\u2019s arms and legs, including one that was five to \nsix inches in diameter, which she stated came from the punch to the thigh. Ms. X stated \nthat she was using Applicant\u2019s vehicle, but she wanted to return it so that he would not \nreport it stolen. Applicant was charged with abuse of family or household member. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5, 11, 12) \nApplicant pled not guilty to the April 2014 charges at a jury trial in March 2015. \nMs. X\u2019s testimony was somewhat similar to her statements to the police, except she \ntestified that she ended up on the ground before Applicant started pulling her by the \nankles, but she could not remember how she got there. She remembered that Applicant \nheld a gun, but she could not remember if he threatened her with it. She testified that \nshe and Applicant had been in contact on multiple occasions since the incident in an \nattempt to work things out in their relationship. They talked about her testifying in his \ntrial, but she could not remember what was said.

He was \nfound not guilty of the firearm offense. Sentencing was set for May 2015. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 11, 12) \nMs. X called the police from a location not far from Applicant\u2019s apartment at \nabout 1930 on April 5, 2015. Applicant also called the police from his apartment at \nabout the same time. Ms. X told the police that Applicant was her boyfriend, and that \nthey had been dating for about a year and five months and lived together for the last five \nmonths. She stated that they were arguing at the top of the stairs when he pushed her, \nand she fell down about three to four steps before she caught herself. She noted that \npart of the stairs was broken in the fall. Applicant threw her phone in the toilet, and he \npunched her several times in the face. The police took photos of her injuries, which \nincluded abrasions on her face, and her eye was swollen to the point of being almost \nclosed. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6) \nApplicant was arrested for abusing a family member, criminal property damage, \nand interference with the reporting of an emergency. He was released on $3,000 bail. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 12) \nApplicant was sentenced for the April 2014 charges on May 27, 2015. He was \nsentenced to probation for one year for the first count and two years for the second, to \nrun concurrently. A term of the probation included imprisonment for seven days, with \ncredit for time served. The case was overturned on appeal in May 2018 for prosecutorial \nmisconduct based on remarks made by the prosecutor in closing argument suggesting \nthat Applicant\u2019s counsel attempted to induce Ms. X to give false testimony during cross-\nexamination. The appellate court found no basis to support the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. \nThe conviction was overturned without prejudice, so Applicant could have faced another \ntrial. The charges were eventually dismissed without another trial. (Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 11, 12) \nApplicant was found not guilty of the April 2015 charges in September 2015. The \nMarch 2015 charge was dismissed in October 2015. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 2, 12) \nApplicant was issued a military protective order (MPO) by his commander in \nearly March 2015 to not initiate any contact or communication with Ms. X and to not \ncome within 500 feet of her.

(Tr. at 45, 62-68, 94-96; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 9) \nApplicant denied that he ever assaulted Ms. X. He stated that their relationship \nwas already over in April 2014, and he just let her stay in the apartment until she could \nmove out. Her sister was there to help with the move. He asserted that she attacked \nhim in April 2014 and the most he did was grab her arms so that she could not hit him. \nHe admitted that he had an unregistered firearm, but he stated that he never picked up \nthe gun that day, and that the gun was in the nightstand, but the magazine was in the \ncloset. The police report indicates that the loaded magazine was in the nightstand \ndrawer with the gun. He denied that they had any romantic involvement after the April \n2014 incident. (Tr. at 14-23, 56-65, 70-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4) \nApplicant stated that Ms. X essentially stalked him for the next year, calling him \nfrequently from new and other people\u2019s numbers, sending texts, and showing up \nunannounced at his apartment. He submitted a muster report showing he was on duty \non March 2, 2015, at the time she said he assaulted her. (Tr. at 14-23, 56-65; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B) \nApplicant asserted that Ms. X left some items at the apartment after she left in \nApril 2014. He was told that he had to return the items. He agreed to leave them in a \nbox outside the apartment door. She showed up on April 5, 2015, and knocked and \nrang his doorbell for about an hour. She then somehow forced her way in and attacked \nhim. He stated that the damage to the apartment was caused by her. He called the \npolice, but he was the one arrested. He testified that he showed the police everything, \nbut the police would not take a report from him. (Tr. at 23-34, 53-56, 61; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 6, AE A) The police report indicates that Applicant was advised in \nwriting of his constitutional right to remain silent (Miranda rights) at 2230 on April 5, \n2015. He initialed next to the section that indicated he did not want to tell the police \nwhat happened. (GE 6) I did not find his testimony credible. \nExcept for the incidents that involved Ms. X in one way or another, Applicant had \nan excellent military career. Several military members believe that he was set up by Ms. \nX, and that he was treated unfairly by his command. He is praised for his outstanding \nperformance of military duties, reliability, and trustworthiness. As part of the Security \nAccess Eligibility Report (SAER) submitted by his command in April 2014, his command \nreported: \n1. Excellence of character: [Applicant] has displayed unquestionable integrity, \nexcellent military bearing and an enthusiasm to excel in his technical field. \n2.

Other comments/observations: The alleged actions are extremely out of \ncharacter for [Applicant]. (GE 10) \nApplicant\u2019s command provided similar comments in an April 2015 SAER. (GE 11) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nApplicant denied that he ever assaulted Ms. X. In some instances, two or more \nwitnesses can provide completely opposite descriptions of the same event, but none of \nthe witnesses are lying. That is not the case here. Either Applicant or Ms. X lied about \nwhat happened in April 2014, March 2015, and April 2015. However, in order to accept \nApplicant\u2019s version of the 2014 incident, I have to believe that not only did Ms. X lie, but \nher sister either also lied or was lied to by Ms. X. I would also have to find that their \nfriend also lied or was lied to by Ms. X and possibly her sister. Additionally, the physical \nevidence, including photos of Ms. X\u2019s injuries, supports her version. I find by substantial \nevidence1 that Applicant committed the criminal conduct alleged by Ms. X. I also find \nthat he was discharged with an other than honorable discharge for misconduct due to \nthe commission of a serious offense, which was violating the MPO. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and \n31(e) are applicable. \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal \nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than \na preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994); ISCR \nCase No. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd.

I am also satisfied that he was in contact with Ms. X after \nApril 2014. I do not have enough evidence to conclude that he committed the specific \nconduct that led to his August 2014 arrest. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAll of the criminal conduct in one way or another involved Ms. X. Applicant is \nmarried to another woman with a young child. Any involvement with Ms. X appears to \nbe in the past. The most recent criminal conduct happened more than seven years ago. \nThere are no bright-line rules for when conduct is considered recent. As discussed \nabove, I have found that Applicant has been untruthful about the criminal charges \nthroughout the security clearance process. Without complete candor, I am unable to \ndetermine that criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. His conduct continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is cross-alleged under SOR \u00b6 2.a. That conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because that \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a duplicitous allegation that cross-alleges all of the criminal conduct \nallegations, including SOR \u00b6 1.e, which alleges Applicant\u2019s discharge for commission of \na serious offense. The serious offense was the MPO violations for which he received \nnonjudicial punishment. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges the nonjudicial punishment for the MPO \nviolations. As such, SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges conduct that is already alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nThere is no factual basis in the record for SOR \u00b6 3.b. That allegation is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe analysis under Guideline J applies equally here. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, the time since the last offense, that all of the \ncriminal conduct in one way or another involved Ms. X, and that he is no longer in \ncontact with her. Nonetheless, I simply do not believe Applicant\u2019s version of events. I \nbelieve he has been untruthful throughout the security clearance process. Without \ncomplete candor, there can be no rehabilitation or mitigation. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. I have incorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2017. (Tr. 72-73; GE 1) In approximately 2000, Applicant was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when he was 16 years old. He had a decreased attention span and an inability to focus. He was treated with Adderall and continued to see a doctor while in college. In about 2005, when he was 21 years old, he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. His doctor prescribed various mood stabilizers, including lithium. (Answer to the SOR) In 2007, Applicant was voluntarily admitted to a hospital for mental health treatment. He was given a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic, Adderall Dependence, and Cannabis Dependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He testified that he took Adderall as prescribed and did not abuse it. His history of marijuana use will be discussed below. (Answer to the SOR) Applicant found that lithium was the most effective medication for his bipolar symptoms, and he took it regularly, as prescribed, beginning in about 2008. From 2010 to 2014, he was voluntarily under the care of Dr. K for mental health treatment (SOR \u00b6 1.c",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 29, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline I, psychological conditions. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 22, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 20, 2021, scheduling the hearing for October 26, 2021. Applicant requested \n\n \n2 \n \n \na continuance, which was granted and the hearing was reschedule for January 4, 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney contracted the COVID-19 virus and requested another continuance, \nwhich was granted, and the hearing was rescheduled for January 18, 2022. Due to \ninclement weather, the hearing was again rescheduled for February 15, 2022. I convened \nthe hearing as rescheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant \nand four witnesses testified. He offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. There were \nno objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into evidence. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on February 23, 2022.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. I have \nincorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2017. (Tr. \n72-73; GE 1) \n \n \nIn approximately 2000, Applicant was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity \ndisorder (ADHD) when he was 16 years old. He had a decreased attention span and an \ninability to focus. He was treated with Adderall and continued to see a doctor while in \ncollege. In about 2005, when he was 21 years old, he was diagnosed with Bipolar \nDisorder. His doctor prescribed various mood stabilizers, including lithium. (Answer to the \nSOR) \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was voluntarily admitted to a hospital for mental health \ntreatment. He was given a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic, Adderall Dependence, \nand Cannabis Dependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He testified that he took Adderall as prescribed \nand did not abuse it. His history of marijuana use will be discussed below. (Answer to the \nSOR) \n \nApplicant found that lithium was the most effective medication for his bipolar \nsymptoms, and he took it regularly, as prescribed, beginning in about 2008. From 2010 \nto 2014, he was voluntarily under the care of Dr. K for mental health treatment (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). Around June 2013, Dr. K became concerned about Applicant\u2019s kidney function due \nto long-term use of lithium and discontinued it and another prescription he was on. After \ndiscontinuing lithium and trying other prescribed medications, Applicant experienced \nmood destabilization and was hospitalized several times for medicine management. (Tr. \n35-36; Answer to the SOR)  \n \nApplicant was voluntarily admitted to the hospital in about June 2013, for mental \nhealth medication stabilization (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The SOR alleges that it was because he \ndiscontinued use of his medication two months before and was experiencing paranoia \nand delusions. The discontinuation of his medicine, lithium, was pursuant to his doctor\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \norders. The discharge diagnosis from the hospital was Bipolar Disorder and Attention \nDeficit Disorder by History. (Tr. 35-36; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital in about May 2014. He was \ntraveling at the time and was in a different state. He began to experience adverse effects \nfrom the recent changes to his medication and went to the emergency room. He advised \nthe medical professionals that he was having problems with his medication and was \nconcerned for his well-being. He contacted his family, his emergency contact, and told \nthem his concerns. Changes were made to his medication, but he indicated it was only \ntemporarily successful at that time. His discharge diagnosis was Bipolar I Disorder, Manic, \nSevere with Psychotic Behavior, and Attention Deficit Disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Answer to \nSOR) \n \nLater in 2014, Applicant moved to a new state and received treatment for his \nbipolar disorder from Dr. S, a psychiatrist, from about August 2014 to January 2015 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). Dr. S tried different medications with limited success. Applicant stated in his SOR \nanswer that this was the first time he had a relatively short period of treatment with a \ndoctor because he had moved to a new city. (Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself to a hospital in January 2015 under the care \nof Dr. S. He felt his move to a new state had exacerbated his bipolar disorder (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g). The discharged diagnosis was Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic, \nsevere, without psychotic features, and Cannabis Abuse. Applicant stated in his SOR \nanswer that he did not feel like it was an acute diagnosis or that Dr. S\u2019s course of treatment \nwas sufficiently managing his disorder. (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He then decided to move back to his \nhome state where there were more medical options, and he had a stronger support \nsystem. (Answer to SOR) \n \nFrom August 2014 to February 2015, while Applicant was being treated by Dr. S, \nhe was also seeing a non-psychiatric mental health professional, Ms. H. He found she \npresented a different approach to treating his condition and made him consider the non-\nmedical and psychological aspects of his disorder, which he found beneficial (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n(Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant moved back to his home state and in approximately April 2015, he \nvoluntarily admitted himself to the hospital for mental health medication management. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h). He had completed the dosages of the medication prescribed by Dr. S. He \nwas provided by the hospital medical professionals with three months of medication and \nwas referred to a directory of local psychiatrists who took his health insurance. He found \nthe hospital stay productive and beneficial. (Answer to SOR) \n \n \nFrom the directory of local psychiatrists, Applicant sought mental health treatment \nfrom Dr. F and saw her from July 2015 to November 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He selected this \nprovider because the practice accepted his health insurance, and he wanted to go to a \ngeneral medical practice. He stated in his SOR answer that it was a horrible experience. \nHe was prescribed a high dose of a strong medication that had potential adverse side \n\n \n4 \n \n \neffects. He had a strong physical reaction to the medicine, which led him to believe he \nhad been misdiagnosed and mistreated. Because of his experience, he changed doctors. \nDr. F diagnosed him with Other Stimulant Abuse, Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type, \nCannabis Dependence, and Alcohol Abuse. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he \ndoes not know what \u201cother stimulant abuse\u201d means and that he does not believe he has \na schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. He said he would not be able to function at his \njob with that condition. He stated that he did not misuse medications or take ones not \nprescribed. He does not abuse alcohol. He testified that Dr. F misdiagnosed him and put \nhim on so much medication that he felt like a zombie. Shortly after his treatment with her, \nhe saw Dr. C. He admitted he was using cannabis before he began treatment with Dr. F, \nbut had not used it since before he applied for a security clearance. He admits he uses \nalcohol, but it has never been a problem, in terms of his mental or physical health, his \ncareer, or his personal life. (Tr. 29-31; Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant began seeing Dr. C in December 2015 and has continued to see him \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). He stated in his SOR answer that the treatment under Dr. C\u2019s care has been \na \u201cgame changer\u201d for him and successful. He has had no major issues and his bipolar \ndisorder and ADHD are under control. He takes his medication as prescribed and \nmaintains regular appointments with Dr. C. He has developed a strong relationship with \nDr. C, who is responsive to his medical issues. Applicant is confident that he will continue \nto have success with Dr. C. (Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer and his testimony that he takes treatment for \nhis bipolar disorder seriously. He takes responsibility for all of his conduct. He stated his \nbipolar disorder has not and will not cause a significant defect in his psychological, social, \nand occupational functioning. He has been under Dr. C\u2019s continuous care since 2015, \nand his condition has been under control and stable. Dr. C has not diagnosed him with \nSchizoaffective Bipolar Disorder during his course of care since 2015. (Tr. 32-34; AE A; \nAnswer to SOR) \n \n \nA letter from Dr. C confirms Applicant is his patient. He stated Applicant has been \nattending his monthly appointments and taking his medications as prescribed. He stated \nthat Applicant\u2019s condition has been stable in recent years. (AE A; Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he began using marijuana when he was 15 years old and was \nusing it daily for a significant period of time. He used it regularly throughout college. From \n2007 to 2015, marijuana was a significant part of his life, and he used it to self-medicate. \nHis medical records note that marijuana use was a treatment concern. Applicant reduced \nhis use in 2015 because it was no longer part of his lifestyle and he had concerns about \nits use and his mental health. Eventually, he stopped using it. He credibly testified that he \nhas not used marijuana since 2017. Some of the states where Applicant used marijuana \nhad legalized it\u2019s use under their state laws. (Tr. 25-26; GE 8 \n \n \nApplicant was not honest during his background interview about his marijuana use. \nWhen confronted by the investigator, he disclosed he started using it in 2013, which was \nuntrue. At some point, he was told by doctors to stop using marijuana as it could increase \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhis bipolar symptoms. During his testimony, Applicant initially attempted to minimize the \nseverity of his prior use, but he admitted he used it throughout high school, but not \nregularly. He used it frequently in college. He reduced his use in 2006, and continued to \nuse it on a regular basis until 2015. He used it a couple of times in 2016 and 2017. (Tr. \n49-62; GE 8) \n \n \nA psychological evaluation was conducted in April 2020 by a government approved \nlicensed clinical psychologist, Dr. B. She based her opinion on Applicant\u2019s medical \nrecords showing he had been in and out of treatment for bipolar disorder and \nschizoaffective disorder, and he had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations. She noted \nthat Dr. F, one of Applicant\u2019s previous treating physicians, provided this diagnosis in 2015, \nafter seeing him for five months in 2015. None of his other treating physicians diagnosed \nhim with schizoaffective disorder. In addition, Dr. B noted that \u201calthough his current \npsychiatrist gave a favorable medical opinion, three previous doctors/therapist did not \nrecommend that he be adjudicated favorably, and they noted that [Applicant] has a \ncondition that could impair his judgment, reliability, and/or ability to safeguard classified \ninformation.\u201d (Tr. 29; GE 7)  \n \nDr. B did not identify the providers who made those recommendations or when \nthey were made. Applicant does not know which providers are being referred to by Dr. B. \nAccording to his record, Dr. S, a previous mental health provider, opined that Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis was good, if he complied with his treatment plan. Ms. H. opined that Applicant\u2019s \ncondition could interfere with his judgment, if he did not follow his treatment plan. The \nthird referenced provider is unknown, but may be the doctor Applicant saw in January \n2015, during a hospital stay, who included in his notes \u201cjudgment remains impaired due \nto current mental state.\u201d (Tr. 29-32; GE 7, 8)  \n \nThe medical records and evidence noted in GE 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6, and 8, do not contain \nany statements by mental health providers corroborating Dr. B\u2019s assertion that other \nproviders did not recommend Applicant\u2019s security clearance be adjudicated favorably \nbecause he has a condition that impaired his judgment, reliability, and/or ability to \nsafeguard classified information.   \n \n \nApplicant reported in his response to government interrogatories and during his \ntestimony that Dr. B said she would contact Dr. C, his treating physician for the past seven \nyears for information about his medical history. He said that he had spoken to Dr. C in \nJuly 2020, and Dr. B had not contacted him before she issued her report. (Tr. 28; GE 8) \n \n \nApplicant testified that Dr. B\u2019s report reflects inaccuracies from information he \nprovided to her. He clarified that his current diagnosis is bipolar disorder and ADHD. He \ndisputes that he misused medications. Dr. B noted that her opinion was also based on \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, adverse opinions from three previous providers, and \ninsubordination and personality conflicts with colleagues and supervisors at work, among \nother things. (Tr. 20) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that he told Dr. B that he was prescribed one to two tablets of \na medication to take in the morning and one tablet at night. Sometimes he took a half \ntablet in the morning and one tablet at night. If he felt he was under acute stress, he would \ntake a whole tablet in the morning, as prescribed. Dr. B indicated in her report that he \nslipped up and sometimes took more medicine than prescribed. Applicant disagrees with \nher statement. (Tr. 26-27; GE 7)  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s February 2018 interview with a government investigator, it was \nbrought to his attention that in 2016 he had two delinquent debts in collection. One credit \ncard debt for $500 and another medical bill for $107. He was unaware of the debts and \nwhen the credit card company contacted him, he paid the debt. He also was unaware of \nthe medical debt because it was sent to the wrong address. He paid it. He has no other \nfinancial issues. It is unknown what financial problems Dr. B is referring to. (GE 8) \n \nDr. B reported in her opinion that Applicant had issues at work with colleagues and \na former supervisor. During Applicant\u2019s 2018 background interview, he disclosed he had \na personality conflict with a supervisor where he was employed in 2016. He did not \nreceive a bad performance evaluation, but he believes his request for a raise had \nsomething to do with him leaving. He testified that his supervisor embarrassed him in front \nof colleagues, which caused him to act emotionally. He walked into her office one day, \nand she commented that he smelled and made her want to vomit. Applicant explained \nthat at the time he was a smoker. He was never disciplined for his conduct and he never \ndisclosed confidential information. He left this employment by mutual agreement. He \nconcurred that he had some challenges at this company. Dr. B noted that Applicant has \nbeen employed with his current company since May 2017, almost three years at the time \nof his evaluation. (Tr. 21-25, 67)  \n \nApplicant also disputed Dr. B\u2019s references that Applicant reported a family history \nof involvement with the KKK and other racist organizations in June 2013. The medical \nrecord reflects the following entry for past history: \u201cHe has a family history of suicide-both \nmom and dad (racism, KKK, attempts).\u201d The entry was made by a doctor during a hospital \nstay. No additional information is provided about this entry. (GE 7, 8). Applicant testified \nthat he has no involvement with hate groups and that his family is Jewish and this \nreference is untrue. (Tr. 66)  \n \nDr. B had Applicant complete a Personality Assessment Inventory test and a \nPositive Impression Management test. Applicant testified that he is not Dr. B\u2019s patient and \nhe had a short interview with Dr. B one time by videoconference. His treating physician \ncontinues to be Dr. C. (GE 7) \n \nBased on the above psychological testing, interview, and review of Applicant\u2019s \nmedical records, Dr. B opined in her April 2020 evaluation that Applicant had diagnosable \nmental health conditions: Bipolar I Disorder (severe, with psychotic features), ADHD \n(combined presentation), and Cannabis Use Disorder (by history, moderate, in sustained \nremission. She concluded: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nTaken together, the risk of future hospitalizations seems moderate. \nAlthough [Applicant\u2019s] current treatment provider gave a favorable \nprognosis, his current presentation, as well as his personal and behavioral \nhealth history must be taken into account (e.g. numerous psychiatric \nhospitalizations, adverse medical opinions from three former providers, \nabuse of prescription medications, deny history of illegal drug use, financial \nproblems, insubordination/personality conflicts with colleagues and \nsupervisors at work, etc.). (GE 7) \n \nDr. B acknowledged that in recent years Applicant seems to have gained some \ninsight and is balanced of late, but his previous pattern of behavior must not be \noverlooked. She concluded that Applicant presents with conditions that could pose a \nsignificant risk to national security. (GE 7) \n \n \nIn December 2021, Applicant\u2019s attorneys requested Dr. NS, a forensic and board \ncertified general psychiatrist, conduct an evaluation of Applicant with the purpose of \nanswering the following questions: Does Applicant present with any condition that could \npose a significant risk to national security?; Does Applicant have any medical, \npsychological, psychiatric, emotional, or substance use conditions which could impair his \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and Whether Applicant has a propensity for \nbehavior that could pose a risk to national security, such as disclosing confidential \ninformation to unauthorized persons due to his mental health conditions. \n \nDr. NS advised Applicant that she was conducting a psychiatric evaluation and no \ndoctor-patient relationship would be established. She also said that information Applicant \nconveyed could be either beneficial or detrimental and could be included in her report \nwhich would be forwarded to his attorneys. She told him she was providing an \nindependent evaluation. (Tr. 42; AE H) \n \n \nIn formulating her evaluation and report, Dr. NS noted her sources of information \nas follows:  \n \n-In person clinical interview of Applicant (December 11, 2021) of 1.5 hours\u2019 \nduration. \n \n-Clinical interview via videoconference of Applicant (December 28, 2021) of 35 \nminutes\u2019 duration. \n \n \n-Phone interview with Mr. K, Applicant\u2019s current supervisor (December 28, 2021). \n \n \n-Phone interview with Dr. C, Applicant\u2019s treating physician (December 20, 2021). \n \n \n-Phone interview with both parents of Applicant (December 17, 2021). \n \n-Outpatient mental health progress notes from Dr. C from December 2015 to \nAugust 2021. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n-Letter from DOHA Department Counsel (April 21, 2021). \n \n \n-Summary of Psychological Evaluation by Dr. B (April 9, 2020). \n \n-Records of DOD CAF subject interview investigation (May 11, 2018 until June 6, \n2018). \n \n-Current employer performance appraisals from May 2020-April 2021; May 2019 \nto May 2020; May 2018-May 2019; May 2017 to June 2018. \n \n-Outpatient mental health progress notes from Dr. S from August 2014 to January \n2015. \n \n \n-Medical records from Applicant\u2019s psychiatric hospitalizations from 2007 to 2015.  \n \n \nDr. NS noted that during her interview with Applicant, he acknowledged his past \nmarijuana use starting when he was 15 and at one point using it daily. He has not used \nmarijuana since 2017. One hospital record notes his misuse of Adderall during periods of \nbipolar disorder. Applicant reported he has complied with his prescribed medicine \nregiment and Dr. C verified this. He reported he drank alcohol heavily in college, and his \ncurrent rate of consumption is two drinks per week. (AE H) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his past psychiatric history, which is consistent with his prior \nmedical records. The records report as follow: He was diagnosed with ADHD when he \nwas 16 and treated with Adderall; diagnosed with a bipolar disorder when he was 21 and \nprescribed several medications, including lithium, which was effective in treating his \nsymptoms; treated by Dr. K from 2010 to 2014, and taken off lithium due to renal \ncomplications; destabilization and several hospitalizations; under the care of various \nphysicians in three different states; began seeing Dr. C in December 2015; stable on \nmedications and has not required further hospitalizations. He sees Dr. C 11-13 times a \nyear. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS reviewed treatment notes from doctors and medical records from each of \nApplicant\u2019s past hospitalizations, which included the diagnoses made at the time of \nadmission; the drugs he was prescribed; his state of being; observations of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior at the time; and opinions of the providers. Dr. NS noted that both Dr. S and Ms. \nH treatment notes reflected that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was good if he remained on his \ntreatment plan. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS reviewed Dr. C\u2019s treatment notes from December 2015, which reflected \nApplicant was being prescribed different medicines to stabilize his condition. In February \n2016, he noted Applicant was stable. Dr. C considered a diagnosis of major depression \nas a primary concern, along with ADHD, and cannabis use disorder. In May 2016, he \nnoted Applicant reduced his marijuana use and his medications were adjusted. In June \n2016, Applicant had mild depression. In July 2016, Dr. C noted euthymic and stable mood, \nand diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder, type 2. Notes from 2019 report that Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmood was stable, but his alcohol intake had increased. He was advised to reduce it. He \nwas not diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. In 2020, Applicant had seven \nappointments with Dr. C from February through October. The records reflect stable \nmoods, no evidence of safety concerns, no evidence of psychosis, and no evidence of \nsubstance abuse. The last available note from Dr. C was from August 2021, which noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s mood was stable and no medication change was recommended. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS\u2019s December 2021 report includes a section titled - History of Present Illness. \nIt states that Applicant does not present with any symptoms of depression, bipolar \ndisorder, psychosis, anxiety or panic attacks. His previous symptoms are well managed \nwith his current medication program. There was no evidence of interpersonal difficulties, \nwork-related concerns, self-injurious behavior, or safety concerns. His ADHD is under \ncontrol with medication. There is no evidence of a personality disorder that can be \nmanifested as maladaptive and rigid patterns of thinking, impulsive actions, self-harming \nbehaviors, chaotic inter-personal relationships. Applicant has not demonstrated behavior \nconsistent with these. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS noted that a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder was considered early in \nApplicant\u2019s illness, but was ruled out. Also ruled out were other psychiatric disorders and \nphobias. Applicant\u2019s current state of being is positive, and he derives satisfaction from his \nwork accomplishments despite having bipolar disorder-related challenges earlier in his \nlife. He believes having to overcome these challenges has taught him valuable lessons. \nHe is on the board of directors of a family foundation. He acknowledges he is a bit cocky \nand can brag about himself. (AE H)  \n \nDr. NS conducted a mental status examination of Applicant. She observed his \nthought processes were logical, rational and cohesive. The examination did not reveal \nany expansive ideations, grandiosity, impulsivity or delusional thinking. He did not display \ndeficits in his cognitive processes. Applicant\u2019s insight was excellent. He understood his \nillness and his need for treatment. His judgment was excellent as evidenced by his \ncontinued adherence with medications, sobriety from substances and interpersonal and \noccupational performance. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS spoke with Mr. K, Applicant\u2019s current supervisor, who described Applicant \nas an exemplary employee and his work performance has been stellar. He has never \nknown Applicant to have oppositional behaviors or having an inability to work in a team \nsetting or for being disruptive at work. He never felt Applicant had problems with authority \nor been distracted or late with assignments. He had no concerns about Applicant\u2019s ability \nto maintain confidentiality. Applicant\u2019s performant appraisals since May 2017 indicated \nexcellence and initiative at work. (AE H)  \n \nDr. NS\u2019s opinion and recommendation regarding Applicant\u2019s current mental health \nconditions based on the security clearance requirements are as follows:  \n \nApplicant meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth \nEdition (DSM-5) criteria for Bipolar Disorder, type 1, most recent episode depressed \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwithout psychotic features in full remission. Dr. NS reported this diagnosis is based on \nhistorical symptoms, noting Applicant\u2019s past episodes and hospitalizations for medicine \nmanagement. Applicant achieved stability in late 2015, had some depressive symptoms \nin 2016, and has had no mood episodes since. Applicant has a history of recognizing \nearly sign of issues and reaching out to providers when needed. He has maintained \nmedication adherence and stability since 2015. He has excelled in his career, \ndemonstrated excellent work performance without any derogatory behavior and \nmaintains healthy relationships. His diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder has had no negative \nimpact on his occupational or interpersonal relationships in over five years. \u201cAs long as \n[Applicant] maintains medication adherence and good communication with his treating \nproviders, his prognosis is good.\u201d (AE H) \n \nApplicant meets the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, predominantly inattention \npresentation. Dr. NS noted that Applicant has been on two medications for it and his \ncondition is stable. The only misuse of Adderall was during adolescence. Since then he \nhas been compliant with good effect and good adherence. Dr. NS noted that this \ndiagnosis is based on historical symptomatology, as Applicant is clinically stable on \nmedications. She noted that, when Applicant was diagnosed with ADHD as an \nadolescent, he did not manifest behavior disinhibition, impulsivity, or novelty seeking \nbehaviors. Instead, he demonstrated good behavior, attendance, peer acceptance, and \ngood academic attainment in school. (AE H) \n \nApplicant meets the DSM-5 criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder, mild, in full \nsustained remission. Dr. NS noted that Applicant has not used marijuana for years. He \nused it to cope with symptoms of his bipolar disorder after lithium was discontinued in \n2013. Applicant does not endorse heavy alcohol use or any other drugs. Based on all \navailable information, Applicant does not meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder. (AE \nH) \n \nApplicant meets the DSM-5 criteria for Tobacco Use Disorder, moderate. Dr. NS \nnoted that this has no bearing on Applicant\u2019s mental health conditions based on all \navailable records. (AE H) \n \nDr. NS found that Applicant has demonstrated emotional and psychiatric stability \nfor over five years, medication adherence, abstinence from cannabis, consistency of \ntreatment with Dr. C, excellent work performance since 2017, and stable interpersonal \nrelationships. She concluded:  \n \nThus, he does not pose any risks to national security based on his mental \nhealth conditions at this time. However, it is recommended that he continue \nto follow up with his psychiatrist regularly and continue to adhere with \nmedications and abstain from Cannabis and Alcohol to maintain remission \nof his conditions. (AE H) \n \nApplicant included copies of performance evaluations from 2017 through 2021. His \n2017 through 2020 overall rating was \u201cexceeds expectations,\u201d the second highest rating. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nHis 2021 rating was \u201cexceptional,\u201d the highest rating. In 2019, Applicant received his \ncompany\u2019s \u201cmajor sustained performance award\u201d for his superlative efforts in establishing \na corporate program management office. In 2020, he was recognized as an outstanding \nteam member for achievement and contributions to his team. (AE B, C, D, E, F, G) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified on his behalf. Applicant has worked for him \nsince 2018 and has daily interaction with him. He describes him as an outstanding \nemployee and is one of his top employees. He is professional and has exhibited good \ndemeanor. He holds himself accountable and is able to handle all of the issues that arise. \nHe believes Applicant is trustworthy and can protect classified and sensitive information. \nApplicant testified that he has an excellent relationship with is supervisor and considers \nhim a mentor. (Tr. 41, 74-79) \n \nThe corporate support manager, who serves as the facility security officer and is \nthe human resource manager, testified. She worked with hiring Applicant five years ago \nand they are on the same team. She interacts with Applicant at least weekly and \nsometimes daily. She described him as a dedicated employee focused on improving the \ncompany. He is enthusiastic in his work. He is passionate, driven, accountable and \nresponsible. She believes he is trustworthy and capable of protecting information. (Tr. 80-\n85) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. She has noticed a significant \nchange in Applicant\u2019s demeanor since 2015. He is happier, responsible, and has found a \ncareer he is excited about. In the past years he has become stronger. He is committed to \nhis own well-being. She believes the changes are due to finding the right doctor and \nmaintaining compliance with his medication requirements. She noticed that he is proud \nof the work he is doing and is motivated to do well. He feels appreciated and valued. (Tr. \n86-92) \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother testified on behalf of Applicant. He is a retired military member \nwith 29 years of service and holds a Top Secret security clearance. He works as a \nprogram manager for a military component. In the past few years, since his retirement \nfrom the military, he and Applicant have had more interaction. He has seen a positive \nchange in his brother in the last several years. Based on his background and experience \ndealing with classified information, he believes Applicant can maintain the requirements \nto hold a security clearance. (Tr. 92-97) \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has been consistently treated by Dr. C since \n2015, and he is following the prescribed treatment plan. He stated: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to \nme, I take it very seriously. The success that I\u2019ve achieved, the impact of following the \ntreatment has been monumental in positive outcomes for my life that I take very seriously \nand maintain.\u201d (Tr. 32) He intends to follow his doctor\u2019s treatment plans. He does not \nintend to use illegal drugs in the future. He believes he is capable of protecting classified \nand sensitive information. (Tr. 32, 41; 43-44; AE A) \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG & 27:  \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other individual guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-hard, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful exploitative, or bizarre \nbehavior;  \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations beginning in 2007, \nwhich were related to medication issues. In April 2020 Dr. B, a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional, opined that Applicant has a condition that may impair his judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness and is a risk to national security. I find the disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 28 (b) and 28(c) apply. The records note some of the behavior described \nunder AG \u00b6 28(a). Although none of that behavior has been observed since before 2015, \nI find that this disqualifying condition marginally applies.  \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nThe evidence documents that Applicant has consistently been compliant with \nseeking medical treatment for managing his mental health. There is insufficient evidence \nto conclude he failed to follow prescribed treatment plans related to his diagnosed \npsychological or psychiatric condition. I find AG \u00b6 28(d) does not apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \n \n \nThere are competing opinions between Dr. B and Dr. NS regarding Applicant\u2019s \nmental fitness to hold a security clearance. Those differences are noted below: \n \n \nDr. NS is not employed by the government, and she was hired by Applicant in \nDecember 2021. In reaching her final opinion, she did the following: a clinical interview of \nApplicant both in person and through a videoconference; interviewed Dr. C and reviewed \nhis notes; reviewed all of Applicant\u2019s medical records, contained in this record; \ninterviewed Applicant\u2019s current supervisor; interviewed his parents; reviewed Dr. B\u2019s \nevaluation; reviewed Applicant\u2019s background interview with government investigators; \nreviewed outpatient records from Dr. S; reviewed medical records of Applicant\u2019s \nhospitalizations; and reviewed Applicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluations. \n \n \nIn reaching her opinion in April 2020, Dr. B reviewed most of the same documents \nthat Dr. NS did, but she did not conduct an in person interview with Applicant and did not \ninterview those people who have had the closest contact with Applicant in the last five \nyears. Most probative, is the fact that she did not contact Dr. C, Applicant\u2019s treating \n\n \n15 \n \n \nphysician for the past seven years, despite telling Applicant that she would do so, and \nwould also contact Applicant\u2019s supervisor with whom he has daily contact.  \n \n \nBased on those critical omissions and the fact that Dr. B evaluated Applicant more \nthan a year prior to Dr. NS\u2019s evaluation, I find that Dr. NS\u2019s opinion to be more recent, \nmore thorough, and more persuasive. Hence, I am relying on it for purposes of reaching \nconclusions in this case. I acknowledge that Dr. NS was not hired by the government, but \nthat fact does not significantly diminish my assessment of her report.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conditions, Bipolar Disorder and ADHD are readily controllable with \ntreatment. Applicant has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with a \ntreatment plan since 2015. AG \u00b6 29(a) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant has consistently shown, since he was diagnosed with mental health \nconditions, that he voluntarily seeks treatment to manage his illness. For a significant \nperiod of time, after going off lithium, the doctors had difficulty finding the right medications \nto manage his problems. As a consequence, he voluntarily sought medical help through \nthe hospital. He has never denied his mental health conditions, nor indicated that he does \nnot take his condition seriously. In 2015, Dr. C was able to find the right balance of \nmedications, and Applicant has been compliant with the recommended treatment plan \nand given a favorable prognosis by Dr. C and Dr. NS. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \n \nBased on all of the evidence presented, I find that Dr. NS\u2019s recent opinion that \nApplicant\u2019s mental health conditions are under control or in remission, and there is a low \nprobability of recurrence, provided he complies with his treatment plan, as most probative. \nI have considered that Dr. NS is not employed by the Government. Dr. NS\u2019s evaluation \nwas unbiased, independent, thorough and more recent than Dr. B\u2019s. The evidence is \nsufficient to conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) applies, despite Dr. NS not being employed by the \nGovernment. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply because although Applicant\u2019s condition is under control \nand being treated, it is not temporary, and it is still a condition that has to be managed. \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that because Applicant has been compliant with \nhis treatment plan, has shown no recent indications of a problem, and has been under a \ndoctor\u2019s care for seven years that there is no evidence of a current problem. I find AG \u00b6 \n29(e) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n16 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline I in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed \nunder that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. I have considered his extensive history of mental health \nissues since adolescence. I have weighed the seriousness of his conditions with the \nactions he has taken to control them. He self-reports when he has concerns about his \nmental health and medications. He has been consistently under doctors\u2019 care since he \nwas diagnosed with mental health conditions. Most importantly, he has been compliant \nwith recommended treatment plans for the past seven years, and there is no evidence \nthat his conditions have caused him physical, mental, or legal problems. In fact, his \nemployer compliments his performance, and his family attests to his change in behavior \nand attitude over the past seven years. After listening to his testimony and observing his \ndemeanor, I am confident that Applicant will promptly seek treatment if he encounters \nmedical issues. Applicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising under Guideline I, psychological conditions.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 46 years-old and twice divorced, but has recently remarried. He has \nthree biological children, and two adult step-children. (Item 8) He served in the U.S. \nArmy (active duty) from September 1996 until December 2013. From January 2014 until \nDecember 2018, he served in a state Army National Guard. He completed a security \nclearance application on April 14, 2019. (Item 3) He has held a security clearance since \nMay 1997. Applicant has worked for his current employer since March 2014. (Item 3) \nFinancial \nThe SOR from October 2020, alleges that Applicant has about $88,348 in \ndelinquent consumer debt. (Item 4) The allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s latest \ncredit report. He admitted 13 of the SOR allegations. He denied the judgment of $1,744 \nin (1.a), and the judgment of $3,513 in (1.b) because they are satisfied. Applicant also \ndenied the delinquent debt in the amount of $40,146 in (1.c) because his home \nforeclosure sale was completed in January 2020, and he owes no deficiency. He \nprovided documentation for these allegations. (Item 3) \nApplicant denied other delinquent debts (1.l), (1.i), (1.r), (1.s), and (1.t) and \nprovided explanations. (Item 4) His explanation was that the debts were unknown to \nhim or were not listed on his credit report. Finally, he denied SOR (1.d) and (1.f) \nbecause they appear to be duplicates. (Item 2) \nApplicant attributed the delinquent debts to his second wife who had a financial \npower of attorney when he was deployed three years out of five years. (Item 8). He \nfound out later that she showed him a spreadsheet of all open accounts that showed \npayments and dates. She assured him that their finances were fine. At some unknown \npoint they separated, and Applicant wanted a divorce in 2016. (Item 3) However, she \nwas still handling the finances, and she removed $10,000 from bank accounts, turned \noff automatic payments, and changed the address to which bank information was sent. \n(Item 2) Applicant stated that it was several months before he realized that she had \nincurred over $54,000 in delinquent debt, two vehicle repossessions, and a house on its \nway to foreclosure. (Item 2 at 5). There is no explanation in the record why he did not \nimmediately monitor their finances when he told his second wife that he wanted a \ndivorce. He neglected to ensure from that point on that the bills were being paid. He \nacknowledged that this decision was not his best.

(Item 2 at 4) \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant added that his earlier credit report before \nhis second wife had a financial power of attorney shows that his accounts were paid as \nagreed. Regarding any good-faith efforts, he responded that a child was born in January \n2020 and he was on paternity leave. His wife\u2019s health was compromised, so he stayed \nhome from work from March to May 2020. His union went on strike until August 2020. \nAs a part of these circumstances it has taken time for him to recover financially. He \nstated that he has set up five individual payment plans with the debtors in SOR 1.m-1.o, \nbut he provided no documentation. He stated that he will be getting a raise and that \nwhen he finished paying the collection accounts to the debt collection company, he will \nmove on to the next debts. (Item 8) \nAt the interview, Applicant was given an opportunity to submit documentation \nregarding the financial delinquencies. He failed to provide any documentation or dispute \ninformation. (Item 7) \nApplicant is gainfully employed. There is some information in the record \nconcerning his net monthly household income of $4,140, with monthly expenses of \nabout $3,500. His total discretionary income was $613. No information concerning \nfinancial counseling was provided. Applicant provided no documentation to support \npayment on any of the other delinquent debts listed on the SOR, save 1.a,1.b, and 1.c. \nIt does appear that 1.d. and 1.f are duplicates. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit reports confirm, that he is indebted in the \namount of about $40,000. He blames the debts on the nefarious actions of his second \nwife who had a financial power of attorney while he was deployed. However, he failed to \nmonitor his wife\u2019s control of the family expenses. After he announced his desire for a \ndivorce, he neglected to ensure that the bills were being paid. His total reliance on his \nspouse does not absolve him of his responsibility. Her behavior was beyond his control \nwhen he was deployed, but he did not act responsibly after he found out about the \nsituation. He also ignored his creditors and told the investigator that he had no income \nto pay or resolve his delinquent debts. This does not show a good-faith effort to resolve \nhis debts. He satisfied one debt in 2021, and the judgments were satisfied by court \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \norder. He owed no deficiency on the home foreclosure, but he had not taken any other \nactions to resolve the situation. All the other delinquent debts on the SOR are \nunresolved. He provided no evidence to prove that he has a track record of paying the \nremaining delinquent debts. He has not sought financial counseling. \nBased on the scant evidence produced by Applicant, it is impossible to conclude \nhe made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts or that his financial situation is \nunder control. The Government has cause to question whether Applicant has his \nfinances under control. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant \nhas made any payments on any of the delinquent debts. Any doubts must be resolved \nin favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m- 1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 14, 2020, detailing security concerns \nraised by financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on \n1 \n\n \nSeptember 1, 2006; and the revised AGs that were made effective on or after June 8, \n2017.  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on November 2, 2020.

Nine character endorsements were submitted \non Applicant\u2019s behalf. Two of those endorsements also provided live testimony, \nApplicant\u2019s wife by in-court testimony and his employer by telephone testimony. \nApplicant testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, his attorney\u2019s request for the record \nto remain open to investigate the status of the state tax debt identified at SOR 1.c, was \ngranted. On October 22, 2021, Applicant\u2019s attorney informed me that the state tax \nagency did not have pertinent records to shed light on SOR 1.c, and that she had no \nadditional documentation to submit.

(Tr. 25-26, 49-50) He \ntestified that when a person is on SSA disability benefits, he is not entitled to benefits if \nhe works over a set number of hours. When Applicant returned to work full time in \nNovember 2010, following a three or four-year period of intermittent part-time and full-\ntime employment, he was over the limit. (Tr. 26-27) His employment history reveals that \nhe worked full time for a security company from February to July 2010, but did not \ninform SSA about the job, nor did he inform SSA about his full-time employment with \nthe title search company (February 2008 to November 2009). Applicant never told SSA \nabout full employment until he visited an SSA office in 2018. (Tr. 53-54, 59-60; Enc. 10) \nApplicant continued to collect SSA benefits after returning to work in November \n2010. In November 2011, his first wife\u2019s health was deteriorating with her three children \n(apparently from another marriage) experiencing serious financial problems. Her oldest \ndaughter could not pay the rent and the daughter\u2019s husband was unemployed. Her son \nwas also going through financial issues. Fearing death was imminent, she asked \nApplicant to continue receiving benefits for her children. Knowing that the stress related \nto her illness might increase if he refused, he agreed to continue collecting SSA \nbenefits. In total, Applicant collected $50,354 in SSA benefits.  He knew that while \nworking full time for his employer between November 2010 and 2014, his earnings were \ntoo much to continue collecting full benefits. Surprisingly, even after learning about his \nfirst wife\u2019s serious illness in late 2011, combined with her earnest request for him to \ncontinue collecting the benefits so he could maintain his obligation to her three children, \nApplicant told the OPM investigator in October 2019 that he simply forgot to inform the \nSSA for two years that he was still collecting benefits after he resumed working in \nNovember 2010. He was 39 years old when his wife died in October 2013.

With his retirement account from the employer he worked for from 2010 \nto January 2020, he paid off most of the benefit debt in 2020 (Enc. 2 at 16), and the \nbalance in April 2021. (AE C at 112-114) Applicant testified that he was unable to set up \nan earlier payment plan in the two SSA meetings in 2018 because the federal agency \nwanted him to make payments he could not afford. (Tr. 27-32) \nSOR 1.b - After the SSA discovered Applicant was working full time from his \nincome tax returns, they sent him a letter in 2014 about the benefits after his wife \npassed. He originally tried to appeal the amount he collected from SSA (circa 2010 to \n2014) seeking to have the benefit amount he owed discharged completely; his appeal \nwas denied in 2015 or 2016. SSA scheduled two appointments for Applicant in 2017, \nbut he did not appear for either one. He visited an SSA office in 2018 on two occasions, \nbut could not afford a payment plan of $1,800 a month. SSA garnished his wages in \nJanuary 2019 for $700 a month. (Tr. 58-61) He did not challenge the garnishment \nbecause he concluded that he could manage the monthly garnishment amount. He \nbelieves that after he received the SOR (October 2020), he recognized that he could \nlose his clearance and his job, so he decided \u201cto be proactive and take responsibility \nand be accountable for my mistake.\u201d (Tr. 33) Applicant removed the garnishment when \nhe restored the SOR 1.a debt to a current status. (Revised answer to amended SOR at \n4; Enc. 2) Applicant regrets taking the SSA benefits and believes he will not repeat this \nconduct in the future. (Tr. 34) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This debt is a state tax lien of $9,503 filed against Applicant and his \nfirst wife in July 2016. (GE 4; Enc. 2) He submitted some payments on the debt and the \nlien was released in December 2020. (Enc. 4) Applicant indicated he became aware of \nthe lien after discovering at the state division of motor vehicles in 2018 his account was \nflagged because of an outstanding debt. The state tax agency confirmed the debt, but \nthey did not explain what the debt represented. Documentation (Enc. 3) shows the lien \nwas released on December 29, 2020 and Applicant avers he made all payments that \nsatisfied the lien. (Revised answer at 5) However, he provided a record of only six \npayments totaling less than $5,000, and all dated in 2020. See, Enc. 4 and 5. He \nsurmised that the size of the lien is due to added interest and penalties. (Tr. 65) \nApplicant speculated that the lien applied to tax year 2016, but could not provide a \nreason. (Tr. 37) \nSOR 2.a - Applicant insists that his full disclosure of the SSA debt on his \nAugust 2018 e-QIP is evidence of his forthrightness throughout the security \ninvestigation. (Revised answer at 8) Applicant did not inform SSA about the periods of \nfull employment until 2018, after the federal agency discovered his full employment \nhistory from his 2014 income tax returns. (Tr. 58-61) \nWith regard to SOR 2.b, Applicant admitted the falsification in December 2020. \nHowever, in March 2021, he denied that he knowingly omitted the information about the \nstate tax debt. He asserts that he did not know about the debt.

(Tr. 36; \n42) \nApplicant submitted a budget that reflects he has a monthly discretionary \nremainder of $1,500, after he pays his expenses. (Enc. 6) The budget is called a \n\u201cmonthly budget,\u201d but the document is not dated and there is no indication that Applicant \nmakes regular changes in his budget and explanations of how the budget interfaces \nwith the manner in which his wife manages her finances. He has never been late on \npaying his debts. He has $120,000 in two retirement accounts from two previous \nemployers, and a March 2021 credit bureau report showing no delinquent debts. (Tr. \n37-40; Enc. 8, 9) Applicant has never participated in financial counseling. (GE 2 at 6) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s employer testified that he has operated his company since 2008. \nSince beginning employment in June 2020, Applicant\u2019s performance as a network \nengineer has been excellent. While most employees experience challenges working on \nthe night shift, Applicant\u2019s diligence has never wavered. The employer is aware of the \ngeneral issues involved in the security clearance hearing, but he does not know specific \ndetails about the allegations. (Tr. 15-22; AE B at 103) \nApplicant\u2019s current wife testified that she began dating Applicant in 2014. She \nmarried him in February 2016. When he talked to her about the debt to SSA, he \nappeared to be remorseful and embarrassed. She became concerned because, with \nfour daughters, she has always tried to handle her financial responsibilities in a timely \nmanner. The wife recalled two occasions of going to SSA in 2016 and 2017 with him to \nwork out a payment plan. Each time SSA advised them that the agency would discuss a \nreduced payment plan and contact Applicant, but never did. They never pursued \nadditional contact with the SSA because of lack of time. She was not aware that he filed \nan appeal to excuse him from paying the SSA benefits. She believed that Applicant \nlearned about the SOR 1.c state tax lien in late 2015 or early 2016, but could not recall \nwhen she and Applicant established the payment plan to resolve the SOR 1.c tax lien. \nApplicant has always been honest with her. He has been a good husband in taking care \nof her and her four daughters. (Tr. 76-88; AE B at 102) \nThe third character reference has been Applicant\u2019s coworker for one and half \nyears. He views Applicant as a trustworthy employee who gets his assignments done \non time. (AE B at 104) \nThe fourth reference has been a coworker and supervisor for three years. \nApplicant is honest, follows the rules, and takes care of his finances. (AE B at 105) \nThe fifth character reference, Applicant\u2019s coworker for 10 years, has found him \nto be a dependable employee who follows the rules.

(AE B at 102-111) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \n18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and, \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust.  \nThe manner in which a person pays his creditors is not a governmental concern \nuntil the record reveals that the person is unwilling or unable to meet their financial \nobligations. If a person demonstrates a pattern of financial irresponsibility, then he may \nalso show irresponsibility in his obligations to abide by the rules associated with \nsafeguarding classified information. \nAn equally important factor of debt payment is when those debts are repaid. If \nthe record shows that the person acts to resolve the debts only after the Government \nputs him on notice that his clearance is at risk, then he may lack the necessary \njudgment to always comply with security rules, which includes those occasions when \nthere is no immediate threat to his personal interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017)  \nApplicant began receiving SSA disability benefits in late 2000. In November \n2010, he resumed work full time. He also resumed collecting SSA benefits that he knew \nhe was not entitled to because of his full-time employment status. Based on an income \ntax return, the SSA sent him a letter in 2014 to recover the funds that did not belong to \nhim. Applicant did not appear for two scheduled SSA appointments in 2017. A \ngarnishment action (SOR 1.b) was filed and enforced against Applicant\u2019s earnings in \nJanuary 2019 to satisfy the delinquent debt in SOR 1.a. Applicant\u2019s failure to act on the \nSSA debt until after he received the SOR in 2020, meets AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nApplicant\u2019s intentional collection of SSA benefits on a regular basis and under deceptive \ncircumstances falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 19(d). \nA state tax lien of $9,503 filed against Applicant in 2016 is verified by \ndocumentation. In his November 2020 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he \nowed the debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply to this state tax lien. \n20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s fraudulent monthly acceptance of SSA benefits while working full \ntime between 2010 and the end of 2013 may not recur. However, the conduct continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment because he knew the \nconduct was wrong, but continued to receive the benefits until his misconduct was \ndiscovered in 2014. Despite several requests by the federal agency over a four-year \nperiod to persuade him to repay the debt, the agency had to garnish his wages in 2019 \nto recover the benefits. After receiving the SOR in October 2020, Applicant paid a \nsubstantial portion of the debt because he believed he was at risk of losing his security \nclearance. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s four-month period of unemployment in 2010 is a circumstance \nrecognized under AG \u00b6 20(b). However, he has been steadily employed for the last 11 \nyears without work-related disruptions or other unanticipated events. When he learned \nabout his delinquent debts in 2014, he did not act responsibly to address his delinquent \ndebt until after he received the SOR. Applicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). Though he has never \nhad financial counseling, there is some indication that he is reestablishing control over \nhis debts. Likewise, there is some evidence to support his good-faith effort to repay the \nstate tax lien. Conversely, although the SSA debt has been repaid, the record precludes \nme from concluding that Applicant made a good-faith effort to repay the debt. \nPersonal Conduct \n15. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nSufficient disqualifying evidence under AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) establishes rule \nviolations. As discussed under AG \u00b6 19(d) of the financial considerations guideline, \nwhen Applicant went back to work full time in November 2010, he resumed collecting \nSSA benefits for the next three years. He knew that collecting the benefits was wrong \nbut he continued collecting them anyway. He stopped after being caught in 2014. \nThe potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior \nis \ninfrequent, \nor \nit \nhappened \nunder \nsuch \nunique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to act promptly to correct his intentional concealment of \nbenefits has been addressed under AG \u00b6 19(d) of the financial considerations guideline. \nHis fraudulent concealment of SSA benefits was not minor, but demonstrated a pattern \nof dishonesty that netted him over $50,000 that he was not entitled to. AG \u00b6 17(c) does \nnot apply. Though Applicant belatedly acknowledged his dishonest conduct, he \ndisplayed poor judgment in not trying to resolve the debt before he received the SOR. \nThe mitigation due under AG \u00b6 17(d) is limited. Sufficient evidence has not been \nsubmitted by the Government under SOR 2.b to establish that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified Section 26 of his August 2018 e-QIP regarding taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old network engineer who has been married to his \ncurrent wife since February 2016. She considers him to be a wonderful husband and \nvery supportive of her four daughters. The owner of the company praises Applicant\u2019s \nwork ethic and leadership abilities. Five additional coworkers and two supervisors are \nimpressed with Applicant\u2019s honesty and reliability. \nThe foregoing favorable evidence does not mitigate the evidence that militates \nagainst Applicant\u2019s security clearance application. When he began receiving disability \nbenefits in 2000, he knew that his benefits were required to be restricted if he worked on \na full-time status. When he resumed work full time in November 2010, he did not inform \nthe SSA of his full-time work status. But this was not the first time he failed to inform \nSSA about working full time. As noted in the factual findings, during two earlier periods \nof employment, he dishonestly received benefits even though he was working full time. \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________ \nGiven the earlier dishonest conduct, combined with Applicant\u2019s wrongful receipt of \nbenefits between late 2010 and the end of 2013, his favorable character evidence does \nnot overcome the adverse security concerns raised by the financial considerations and \npersonal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on July 20, 2021. The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on \nFebruary 1, 2022. The case was heard on March 24, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called two witnesses in her \ncase, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through H, which were also admitted without \nobjection. Applicant Exhibit I is discussed below. She asked that the record remain open \nfor the receipt of additional documentation.

One at 10.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. She denied \nSOR allegations 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k with explanations. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old and married with two children. She received a doctorate \ndegree in 2008. She is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance \nin connection with her employment with a defense contractor as a senior executive and \nfacility security officer (FSO). (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; \nTr. One at 45-47.) \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nSOR allegations 1.a, and 1.b concern Applicant\u2019s relatives who are dual citizens \nof Taiwan and Canada. \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. Her family lived in the United States, \nCanada, and Taiwan when she was young. She returned to the United States in 1998 to \nattend college. She has lived in the United States ever since. Applicant\u2019s husband is \nalso a native-born American citizen. They were married in 2012 and have two U.S.-born \nchildren. (Tr. One at 60.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens of Taiwan and Canada, and reside in \nTaiwan. Neither of her parents have any connection to the Taiwanese or Chinese \ngovernments. Canadian influence was not alleged as a concern. (Tr. One at 60, 62.) \nApplicant has been estranged from her mother for many years. The reason is \nunknown, but appears to center around her choice of husband, who is not Taiwanese. \nShe stated, \u201cMy mother, the relationship is pretty much non-existent from her side. It\u2019s \nvery binary. After I got married, she stopped talking to me pretty much unless she has to \nbecause there are other people there.\u201d Applicant last saw her mother in 2018 in Taiwan \nin connection with her brother\u2019s wedding. (Tr. One 62-65, 67-68.) \nApplicant\u2019s father runs a company with his brothers. Applicant has no ownership \ninterest in the company and cannot inherit any interest in it because she is a woman. \nThe factory does no business with the Taiwanese or Chinese governments. She has \nnever received any financial benefit from the company. (Tr. One at 60-61.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith regard to her relationship with her father, Applicant testified that it was \ngrowing more distant over the years. She stated, \u201cAnd, then, with my father, it\u2019s better. \nWe still talk to each other on the phone. It was more frequent when I was in school. It \nwas pretty much weekly. Now, it\u2019s not so much. My life is busy, his life is busy. So, if \nwe\u2019re lucky, maybe every other week, we call and chitchat.\u201d She last saw her father in \n2019 in her state of residence when he was there on a business trip. (Tr. One at 63-65.) \nApplicant has two brothers. Her older brother was born in the United States and \nresides here. He submitted a statement in support of his sister. However, he admits in \nthat statement, \u201cOver the years, my relationship with [Applicant] has become distant.\u201d \n(Applicant Exhibit G.) \nHer other brother is a citizen of Taiwan and Canada. He is a Permanent Legal \nResident of the United States and has resided in the United States for over 20 years. \nApplicant has little contact with this brother, which he confirmed in his testimony. Her \nbrother stated that the relationship is \u201ccordial,\u201d and that he last saw her in 2018. \nApplicant believes that her fraught relationship with her mother is the cause of the \ndistant relationship with both of her brothers. (Tr. One at 23-36, 65-67.) \nSOR allegation 1.c concerns Applicant\u2019s alleged relationship with a Taiwanese \ncitizen/resident. In her e-QIP Applicant disclosed quarterly contact with a Taiwanese \ndoctor. This doctor had provided medical care to Applicant\u2019s spouse for several years. \nIn addition, this person introduced Applicant and her spouse to a Taiwanese builder \nwho helped them buy some property and construct a building, further described under \nSOR allegation 1.d, below. Applicant stated that the relationship is cordial but not close. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse confirmed that the relationship is related primarily to his health care, \nand the property located in Taiwan. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 19; Tr. One at 69-\n71; Tr. Two at 46-47, 52-53.) \nSOR allegations 1.d through 1.k involve Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s foreign financial \nconnections. Several general statements are applicable to these particular allegations. \nFirst, Applicant and her spouse confirmed that she has no ownership interest in any of \nthe foreign financial accounts and investments of her husband. Out of a surplus of \ncaution, Applicant reported these accounts on her e-QIP, even though the accounts are \nnot in her name and she has no ownership interest in them. Second, these investment \nvehicles and bank accounts are used by Applicant\u2019s spouse to diversify his portfolio, a \ncommon investment strategy. As further described below, with the exception of a small \nbank account in China, all of his foreign bank accounts and other financial interests are \nin nations that are friendly to the United States, or allies of the United States. Finally, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has consistently reported to the Federal Government the existence \nof his foreign bank accounts and the amounts in them. (Answer at page 5; Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 20A, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. One at 77; Tr. \nTwo at 54, 58-62.) \nAs stated, Applicant has been employed by her husband\u2019s closely-held \ncorporation (The Company) since their marriage in 2012. She has no ownership interest \nin The Company. Applicant\u2019s husband is a very successful scientist and entrepreneur \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwho began The Company in 1998. His net worth in the United States is between 35 and \n40 million dollars. He supplied extensive documentary evidence to support that \nstatement. (Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. One at 44-47; Tr. Two at 63-66.) \nWith that background, we move to a discussion of the specific allegations. \n1.d. Applicant\u2019s spouse purchased property in Taiwan. He subsequently built on \nthat location with an expectation of creating some kind of hospitality business. Those \nplans have not come to fruition. The building is vacant and Applicant\u2019s spouse has no \ncurrent plans to finish the building or have it occupied. He believes the property and \nbuilding to be worth approximately $1,000,000. He owes about $400,000 on the \nproperty. This property is part of his diversification investment strategy. (Tr. One at 71-\n76; Tr. Two at 46-50.) \nWith regard to the specific bank accounts described below, the figures in them \nare derived from the most recent Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports (FBAR), \nwhich are for 2020. The FBARs also confirm that Applicant\u2019s spouse is the individual \naccount holder on all of them. Finally, a review of the FBARs reveals that the accounts \nare static holdings. In other words, there has been no appreciable increase in the \namounts held in the various bank accounts. (Applicant Exhibit H.) \n1.e. Applicant\u2019s spouse has two bank accounts in Foreign Country (FC) A. Their \ncombined value in 2020 was $713,278. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70-71.) \n1.f. Applicant\u2019s spouse has one bank account in FC B. The value of this account \nin 2020 was $495,127. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.) \n1.g. Applicant\u2019s spouse has one bank account in FC C. The value of this account \nin 2020 was $387. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.) \n1.h. Applicant\u2019s spouse has one bank account in FC D. The value of this account \nin 2020 was $6,915. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. Two at 56-57.) \n1.i. Applicant\u2019s spouse has three bank accounts in Taiwan. One of them has no \nmoney, according to the 2020 FBAR. The other two have a combined value of \n$115,893. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69, 71; Tr. Two at 53-54.) \n1.j. Applicant\u2019s spouse has one bank account in China. The value of this account \nin 2020 was $77. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. 57-58.) \nThe total value of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s foreign bank accounts is $1,331,677. \nWhen one includes the property and building, his foreign holdings amount to about \n$2,000,000. This figure is approximately 7% of his stateside net worth, which is \nestimated between 35 and 40 million dollars. \n1.k. Applicant\u2019s spouse established a company in Taiwan in approximately 2014. \nThis company has no assets and does no business. Applicant\u2019s spouse established the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompany with the hope that it might improve relations with his in-laws.

Two at 43-46, 68-71.) \nApplicant stated that she does not rely on any of the foreign accounts or \ninvestments to cover their daily living, personal or family expenses. These foreign \naccounts \u201cdon\u2019t affect our day to day life.\u201d In addition, she stated that she does not own \nany real property or other assets outside the United States. She has personal bank \naccounts in the United States with a value of approximately $75,000. (Tr. One at 78-79.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a written statement from a counterintelligence (CI) agent for \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Service. He has worked with the \nApplicant since 2017 in her role as FSO of The Company. (Tr. One at 58-59.) \nThe CI agent stated in Applicant Exhibit F: \n[Applicant] has been my primary point of contact when I need to provide \nCI information to [The Company]. As an FSO, [Applicant] has been very \nopen and easy to work with, and under her stewardship, her company has \nconsistently reported more suspicious incidents than any other company \nin [the state where The Corporation is located]. The information reported \nhas been valuable to the Intelligence Community. . .. I can always count \non [Applicant] to be proactive and do the right thing. \nHis statement goes on: \nEspecially given my position, I appreciate and respect the seriousness\nand gravity of the security clearance application process. While my\ninteraction with [Applicant] has been limited as described above, it is my\nopinion [Applicant] has been open and honest in her interactions with me.\n[Applicant] has been proactive in ensuring her company is reporting a\nwide variety of suspicious incidents. I often use [Applicant] as an example\nof the importance of the FSO in identifying suspicious incidents when I am\nworking with other companies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she would contact the CI Agent if there were any \nquestions or concerns about foreign contacts. She has taken classes as FSO on items \nto be aware of in the counterintelligence area. (Tr. 79-80, 87.) \nA former supervisor of Applicant testified and supplied a written statement. He \nworked with Applicant before her marriage. He described Applicant\u2019s work as, \n\u201cexceptional, very thorough, very well organized and thought out.\u201d The witness went on \nto describe her character as, \u201cUnquestionable from my perspective. I trust her implicitly. \nShe is very honest, very straightforward. Never a questionable moment in our \ninteraction. I certainly have a high regard for her character.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. \nOne at 48-52.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTaiwan \nApplicant has contacts with Taiwan. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at the \ncurrent situation concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is a multiparty democracy whose \nauthorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Taiwan is an active \ncollector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the \nadministrative notice documents in the record. However, the record does not \ndemonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to \ncollect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth \nnoting that the U.S. Government, and the Defense Department in particular, have a \nclose and continuing relationship with Taiwan and its military, in accordance with the \nTaiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic \nrelations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, \u201cThe \nDepartment of Defense remains steadfastly committed to working with Taiwan to \nprovide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense \nconsistent with our obligation set out in our Taiwan Relations Act. We oppose all \nunilateral efforts to alter the status quo, and will continue to insist any resolution of \ndifferences accord with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\u201d \n(Department of Defense, Remarks by Secretary Mattis at Plenary Session of the \n2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/ \nArticle/1538599/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-plenary-session-of-the-2018-shangri-la-\ndialogue/ (June 2, 2018).) \nChina \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference. China is a \nlarge and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion people \nand an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian \ngovernment, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor record with \nrespect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and engages in arbitrary arrests \nand detentions, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China is one \nof the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected U.S. technology \nand economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering \nprograms, both legal and illegal. As a result, it is a growing threat to U.S. national \nsecurity. In addition, China views Taiwan as part of China. China has engaged in many \ndifferent coercive diplomatic and military activities, seeking to isolate and intimidate \nTaiwan into unification on China\u2019s terms. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are arguably applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s parents live in Taiwan. They are citizens of Taiwan and Canada. One \nof her brothers is a citizen of Taiwan and Canada and lives in the United States. \nApplicant and her spouse have a cordial relationship with a Taiwanese doctor. \nThis doctor treats Applicant\u2019s spouse. He was also involved in helping Applicant\u2019s \nspouse obtain the building that is the subject of SOR allegation 1.d. Under the particular \ncircumstances of this case, I find that this relationship has little to no security \nsignificance. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a considerable amount of money deposited in several \nforeign banks. The amount of money he has deposited overseas is $1,331,677. In \naddition, he has approximately $400,000 in equity in the building he owns in Taiwan. All \nof the above disqualifying conditions have application to this case. \nTaiwan is an active collector of industrial espionage. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. In addition, though not specifically alleged, I have \nconsidered China\u2019s activities and attitude with regard to Taiwan and the United States. \n(See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s parents live in Taiwan. Her \none brother who is not a U.S. citizen is a legal long-time resident of the United States. In \nthis particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security significance arising \nfrom these facts for the following reasons. It is unfortunate for Applicant, but she has \nminimal contact with her parents and her brother. She and her mother have been \nestranged since her marriage ten years ago and have hardly spoken since. Her \nrelationship with her father is better, but is still distant. Applicant, a native-born \nAmerican citizen, has lived in the United States for over 20 years. She obtained her \nadvanced education here. Against her mother\u2019s wishes, she married the native-born \nU.S. citizen she chose, and they have two children. She is a senior executive in The \nCompany, and the record shows that she and her spouse are partners in all ways. As \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfurther described, through her husband, Applicant has substantial financial interests in \nthe United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \nApplicant is knowledgeable about her security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to influence her. As the FSO for \nThe Company she has a long history of working with CI agents of the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Service. I have particularly considered the statement \nof the agent who works with Applicant. His positive remarks about her proactive \napproach to her FSO responsibilities is particularly noteworthy. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nAs stated, Applicant\u2019s spouse is a very wealthy man. He has substantial holdings \nin the United States, worth between 35 and 40 million dollars. He also made the \ndecision to engage in diversification of his assets by depositing sums in foreign financial \ninstitutions. With the addition of the equity in the empty building in Taiwan, his foreign \nassets amount to only about 7% of his American-based wealth. Though the amounts \nare large, compelling evidence was shown that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s financial activities \noverseas have been routine. Applicant and her spouse both testified that losing any or \nall of the foreign accounts would have minimal effect on them, given their substantial \nincome and assets in the United States. \nApplicant has completely mitigated the security significance of her connections to \nTaiwan, as well as her husband\u2019s foreign financial connections. Paragraph 1 is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment. Applicant has shown \nherself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense \nindustry. She can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates due to her sense of loyalty and deep personal connections to the United States, \nthe land of her birth. There is very minimal, if any, potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

For each allegation, she provided a brief explanation. Her admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old. She grew up in a family of 10 children. She graduated from high school in 1986 and worked her way through college. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999, an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and a master\u2019s degree in 2017. She was married from 1993-2006 and again from 2008-2010. Both marriages ended in divorce. She has three sons, ages 28, 21, and 8. Her youngest son lives with her. (GE 1; AE B, AE C, AE D, AE E, AE F) Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1992 to May 2015. She spent her first 10 years as an enlisted soldier, and was commissioned as an officer in 2002. She retired as a Major (O-4). While serving in Iraq, Applicant was badly wounded and she was evacuated to Germany for treatment. Her combat-related injuries led to her placement on temporary disability in May 2013, and ultimately to her full retirement from the Army two years later as an 80% disabled veteran. She received two Meritorious Service Medals, six Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals, and numerous other service awards, medals, and commendations for her service to the country in uniform.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out, in pertinent part, in \nAG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. She and her first husband filed \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2000, and she did so again in 2014, in the \naftermath of her second divorce and her war injuries and related Army disability and \nretirement. Despite her claims, the SOR debts post-date her 2014 bankruptcy, as they \nare all listed on credit reports from 2019 and 2022, and those reports indicate that the \ndebts were incurred after the second bankruptcy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nThe starting point for mitigation analysis in this case is AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nasserted in her background interview, in her answer to the SOR, and repeatedly in her \nhearing testimony, that the SOR debts are not hers, either because they were resolved \nin the 2014 bankruptcy discharge, or because the debts were attributable to family \nmembers who obtained the accounts fraudulently. She provided no documentation to \nsupport any of these assertions. (The 2014 bankruptcy documents, which are in the \nrecord, do not support these claims). Without such evidence to bolster her testimony, \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to counter the Government\u2019s evidence that she is \nresponsible for all of the debts in the SOR, as established by credit reports in the \nrecord, from 2019 and 2022. (I accept Applicant\u2019s testimony about SOR \u00b6 1.g, a small \npast-due medical debt, since the VA or Tricare likely covers her medical expenses). \nApplicant worked her way through college, completed additional education and \ntraining, served bravely and honorably in the Army both in enlisted service and as a \ncommissioned officer in the Army, was badly wounded in Iraq, and was medically retired \nas an 80% disabled veteran. She has established a good career in the defense industry \nin the years since. However, she did not offer a credible explanation for how her recent \ndebts came to be, she did not accept responsibility for them, and has not taken any \nsteps towards resolving those debts. \nUnfortunately, since Applicant took the position that the SOR debts are not hers, \nand she is not responsible for them, she has not done anything to resolve them in any \nway that might show responsible action on her part. Nor did she explain how the debts \ncame to be. Applicant has worked in the defense industry, with a six-figure salary, for \nseveral years, and she earns additional income through her retirement pay and VA \nbenefits. Despite this, she has not made a concerted effort to pay or resolve her SOR \ndebts, all of which post-date the 2014 bankruptcy. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply, and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant participated in credit counseling through her bankruptcy cases and \nearlier, but she has not established that her debts are being resolved and are under \ncontrol.

She did not establish that the behavior leading to \nmost of her debts was infrequent, unlikely to recur, or no longer casts doubt on her \ncurrent judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has significant whole-person evidence in her favor. She worked her \nway through college, joined the Army as an enlisted soldier, earned a commission, and \neventually served for over 20 years, retiring as a major. She was badly wounded in Iraq, \nwas placed on disability and ultimately retired with an 80% disability rating. She has had \na good career in the defense industry in the years since leaving the Army. \nUnfortunately, this evidence does not outweigh the continuing evidence of delinquent \ndebts, and her lack of action to address them responsibly.

On \nOctober 14, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 12, 2021, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 23, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \nevidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6.

He divorced his first wife of 23 \nyears in 2016. He has four children of his first marriage, three adults and one minor. He \nhas four adult stepchildren of his second marriage. His educational history was not \nindicated in the record. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an application \ndeveloper since 2010, when his initial security clearance was granted. He was previously \nemployed by another employer as a programmer from 2004 through 2010. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts totaling $47,715, including two federal \nincome tax accounts totaling $9,929, nine federal student loan accounts totaling $35,086, \nthree medical accounts totaling $1,506, and two consumer accounts totaling $1,194. In \nhis SOR answer, Applicant admitted each alleged debt. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his 2016 divorce and 2017 marriage. \nHe stated: \u201cMy life was turned upside down during those couple of years. Some things \nslipped through the cracks during that time. It\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d He did not proffer any \ndetails concerning his income or expense history. (Item 3 at 34, 36) \nIn his August 2019 SCA, Applicant addressed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nthough 1.p, but not the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. He planned to contact\nthe creditor \u201cwithin the next couple of months\u201d to resolve the medical debt alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.e, which he attributed to treatment for one of his children. He was \u201cworking with the\nIRS to get everything paid and current,\u201d and planned to take out a personal loan to pay\nhis tax debt if the IRS did not accept a payment plan. He maintained that he was not\naware of his student loan debt until he received a letter from his lender that his balance\nhad been paid via a wage garnishment. He claimed that he had neither noticed that his\nwages had been garnished nor received any notification of the garnishments until he\nreviewed his pay stubs upon receipt of that letter. He verified the garnishments, but did\nnot indicate the amount garnished. He acknowledged that there remained a balance\nowed, and planned to contact the collection agency to whom the U.S. Department of\nEducation had transferred the accounts to set up a payment arrangement. (Item 3 at 34-\n40) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant asserted in his August 2019 SCA that he had been rebuilding his credit \nand paying off his debt \u201con [his] own,\u201d but planned to look into working with a credit \ncounseling service to help \u201cmaximize\u201d his and his wife\u2019s credit scores so that they could \nbuy a home in 2019. He maintained that his credit score had gone up 115 points and that \nhe was using only two credit cards, the balances of which he paid in full each month. His \nJanuary 2021 credit report showed two active credit cards in current status with minimal \nbalances, but no mortgage account. It also revealed a reduced balance of $803 for the \nconsumer debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,105), and higher balances for each of the student \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.n, which then totaled $35,928. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e did not appear in the credit report. (Item 3 at 36) \nIn about November 2019, Applicant engaged the services of debt resolution \ncompany to assist him with resolving his tax and student loan debts. He provided copies \nof related disclosure forms and email correspondence, dated November 2019. However, \nhe did not proffer any details about the progress, if any, he made on resolving those debts \neither through the debt resolution company or otherwise. (Item 4) \nApplicant was disciplined by his employer in 2016 for violating the terms of his \ncompany credit card. He charged approximately $2,000 on the card, which was \napparently not authorized by his company. He stated: \u201cI was going through a divorce. I \nhad put travel expenses on the card. My ex wife [sic] cleaned out the bank account, so I \nwas unable to pay it when it was due.\u201d He paid the balance due eventually, just not on \ntime. His employer revoked his credit card as a result. (Item 3 at 35-36, 38-39). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record establishes the following two disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts appear to have largely resulted from circumstances \nbeyond his control. I credit him with the reduced balance of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.a. I also give him credit for initiating action to resolve his student loan and tax debts in\nNovember 2019, well before issuance of the SOR. However, without documentary proof,\nI am unable to conclude that he made any progress with resolving his debts either through\nthe debt resolution company or otherwise.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to establish mitigation because he did not \nprovide sufficient documentary evidence to corroborate his actions to resolve his debts, \nor to establish his income and expense history. I am unable to conclude that Applicant is \nadhering to good-faith efforts to resolve his debts or otherwise acted responsibly to \naddress his debts; that he is able to repay his debts; and that his indebtedness is not \nlikely to recur. He demonstrated poor judgment by using his company credit card in an \nmanner not authorized. Collectively, these factors leave me with doubts about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Thus, I find that he has not \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), (b), (d), and (g) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On December 21, 2021, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF), since renamed the DCSA Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS), \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec.

(Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March 21, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on March 30, 2022.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an electrician since he was employed in December 2015. He was previously employed \nby other employers in identical or similar positions since March 2012. He is a 1987 high \nschool graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July 1987 and served on active duty until \nhe was honorably discharged in July 1991. Although Department Counsel reported that \nhe had also served in the reserve from 1991 until 1994, there is no information in the case \nfile to confirm that information, and in his SF 86, Applicant denied any military service \nafter July 1991. (Item 3 at 20) He was granted a security clearance in 2014. He was \nmarried in 1993. He has six children, born in1994, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2007. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated February 24, \n2022); Item 3 (SF 86, dated November 20, 2019); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nFebruary 23, 2022); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 1, 2020); Item 6 (Combined \nExperian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated December 26, 2019); and Item \n7 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 5, 2020). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some financial issues. He listed a \ndebt consolidation company that was assisting him, and stated: \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWe had to use credit card to pay basic needs of the family.

Our 3rd oldest daughter . . . is a diabetic so we went \nthrough our funds really fast. \n[W]e are making $700.00 month payments with automatic deductions from \nour checking account for 3 years to resolve our credit debt while I was on \nlayoff for almost two years. \n(Item 3 at 39-40) \nApplicant also reported several inconsistent periods of unemployment resulting \nfrom his being laid off due to a lack of work: September 2008 \u2013 December 2010; \nSeptember 2009 \u2013 December 2009; January 2010 \u2013 August 2010; September 2010 \u2013 \nDecember 2010; and November 2011 \u2013 March 2012). (Item 3 at 14-19) \nOn February 5, 2020, he was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he described his delinquent \naccounts and essentially claimed that three factors contributed to his financial difficulties: \nhis repeated periods of unemployment that necessitated his reliance on credit cards; the \nexpenses he incurred because of his daughter\u2019s diabetic medicine needs; and his son\u2019s \nfailure to make his student loan payments without informing Applicant who happened to \nbe a co-signer on the loans. \nApplicant stated that when he became aware of the delinquent accounts, on \nFebruary 23, 2019, he contacted a debt consolidation company, and set up an \narrangement under which $700 is automatically withdrawn from his checking account \neach month to be applied to his delinquent debts. Some of the debts have been settled \nfor less than the original amounts owed; some debts are still in the process of being paid \nout of his monthly payments; and the delinquent educational loans are either being paid \nby him or his son. He said that now that he has a steady job, he considers his financial \nsituation to be \u201cgood.\u201d The investigator offered him the opportunity to furnish financial \ndocumentation to support his claims, but he failed to do so. (Item 3 at 4-9) In response to \nthe SOR and to the FORM, Applicant still failed to submit any documentation to support \nhis contentions regarding his relationship with the debt consolidation company or any \ncontacts or agreements with, or payments to, creditors. \nThe SOR alleged seven still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $78,800, \nas set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $134 that was \nplaced for collection. The account initially became delinquent in 2015. (Item 5 at 1; Item \n6 at 17-18; Item 7 at 9; Item 2 at 1) In February 2020, Applicant stated to the OPM \ninvestigator that the bill had apparently slipped through and was an oversight. (Item 7, at \n9) In his February 2022 Answer to the SOR, he claimed that the account was under an \ninsurance coverage review, but he failed to offer any documentation to verify his claim. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Item 2, at 1) He failed to offer an updated status of the account in response to the FORM \nin April 2022.

The account initially became delinquent in \n2019. (Item 4 at 8; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 6 at 15) Applicant contended that, in July 2021, he \npaid off the account with funds from his annuity account. (Item 2 at 2) Despite his failure \nto submit any documentation to verify his contentions, the February 2022 credit report \nfurnished by the Government essentially confirmed Applicant\u2019s position and indicates that \nthe account was settled and it was paid for less than full balance. There is now a zero \nbalance. (Item 4 at 8) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an education loan with an unpaid balance of $16,923 that was \nplaced for collection and assigned to the Government. The account initially became \ndelinquent in 2015. (Item 4 at 4, 7; Item 5 at 3) Applicant contended that on an unspecified \ndate a payment plan was established and unspecified payments have been made, without \nspecifying amounts or dates of the payments. (Item 2 at 3) He failed to submit any \ndocumentation to verify his contentions, and it appears that the loan is still in default. The \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a bank-issued store credit-card account with an unpaid \nbalance of $6,992 that was placed for collection and charged off. The account initially \nbecame delinquent before 2019. (Item 4 at 7; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 17; Item 7 at 5) \nApplicant contended that, in October 2020, he paid off the account. (Item 2 at 2) Despite \nhis failure to submit any documentation to verify his contentions, the February 2022 credit \nreport furnished by the Government essentially confirmed Applicant\u2019s position and \nindicates that the account was settled and it was paid for less than full balance. There is \nnow a zero balance. (Item 4 at 8) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g. refer to education loans with unpaid balances of \n$25,862; 16,249; and $1,439 that apparently defaulted and were placed for collection by \nSallie Mae Bank. (Item 6 at 15-17; Item 7 at 3, 5-7) Applicant contended that on an \nunspecified date a payment plan was established for the accounts and unspecified \npayments have been made, without specifying amounts or dates of the payments. (Item \n2 at 3) He failed to submit any documentation to verify his contentions. In the absence of \nmore detailed information regarding each account, because of the unusual process of \nhandling and reporting delinquent education loans by the original lender, the loan \nservicer, and the U.S. Department of Education, in various stages of reporting such \ndelinquencies, different account numbers are assigned, making it extremely difficult to \nalign accounts that are reported during different stages of their status. Nevertheless, \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to fully address these accounts with some verifying \ndocumentation, I have concluded that the accounts have not been resolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling (as opposed to credit repair), a \nbudget, or anything to describe with any specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. \nOther than telling the OPM investigator in February 2020 that his current financial \nsituation was \u201cgood,\u201d he did not report his current net monthly income, his monthly \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhousehold expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for even the most insignificant of \nhis delinquent debts). In the absence of such information, I am unable to determine if he \nhas any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There is a paucity of \nevidence to indicate that his financial problems are now under control, and it is difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case.

(See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged seven still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $78,800. \nIn 2019 and 2020, Applicant essentially attributed his inability to maintain those accounts \nin a current status to several factors: his repeated periods of unemployment that \nnecessitated his reliance on credit cards; the expenses he incurred because of his \ndaughter\u2019s diabetic medicine needs; and his son\u2019s failure to make his student loan \npayments without informing Applicant who happened to be a co-signer on the loans. \nSeveral of the accounts initially became delinquent in 2015. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply, but none of the other conditions apply. As noted \nabove, Applicant has a history of financial difficulties going back at least to 2015 when \nthe first of his SOR-related accounts became delinquent. During the repeated and \nsometimes extensive periods of unemployment, after exhausting his savings, he relied \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \non his credit cards to pay for necessary family living expenses.

Interestingly, while he contended that he started a professional relationship \nwith the debt consolidation company in February 2019, Applicant did not claim that he \nmade any effort to contact any creditors or made any payments in an effort to resolve his \ndebts between 2012 and 2019. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in February 2020 and the date his response to the FORM was expected in \nApril 2022, he made no claimed or verifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent \ndebts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. There is evidence to support his contentions \nthat two credit-card accounts have been resolved when the creditors accepted less than \nthe full outstanding balances to resolve those accounts. The status of those two accounts \nwas verified only because of comments appearing in Item 4, and not by any \ndocumentation furnished by him, despite several opportunities to do so. The situation \nregarding the delinquent medical account of $134 is troublesome. Applicant \nacknowledged in February 2020 that it was delinquent because it had apparently been \noverlooked. In February 2022, it was reported that the account was still under insurance \nreview. It was not addressed in response to the FORM. Because of his failure to confirm \npayment of even that small delinquent account, and his failure to furnish documentation \nregarding any of the accounts, even though they were requested by the OPM investigator \nin 2020, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems \nare not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to verifiably address his \ndelinquent accounts while employed and by failing to any verifiable efforts of working with \nmost of his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, with two exceptions, Applicant \noffered no verifiable actions regarding any past or proposed repayment efforts; submitted \nno documentary evidence to reflect either his professional relationship with the debt \nconsolidation company or any payments made; and only made promises of claimed or \nproposed actions. Two of the delinquent debts have been resolved for less that the full \nbalance. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct that \nApplicant claims he is engaged in with the debt consolidation company; established \npayment plans; status agreements with the original education loan lender, the loan \nservicer, or the U.S. Department of Education; financial counseling, a budget, or current \nfinancial information. Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \nelectrician since he was employed in December 2015. He was previously employed by \nother employers in identical or similar positions since March 2012. He is a 1987 high \nschool graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July 1987 and served on active duty until \nhe was honorably discharged in July 1991. He was granted a security clearance in 2014. \nApplicant essentially attributed his inability to maintain his accounts in a current status to \nseveral factors: his repeated periods of unemployment that necessitated his reliance on \ncredit cards; the expenses he incurred because of his daughter\u2019s diabetic medicine \nneeds; and his son\u2019s failure to make his student loan payments without informing \nApplicant who happened to be a co-signer on the loans. Applicant settled and resolved \ntwo of his seven delinquent debts by paying the creditors less than the unpaid balances. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. The SOR alleged seven still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $78,800. In 2019 and 2020, Applicant essentially attributed his inability to \nmaintain those accounts in a current status to the factors described above. Several of the \naccounts initially became delinquent in 2015. However, as noted above, Applicant\u2019s \nperiods of unemployment took place between 2009 and 2012, and he has been fully \nemployed since March 2012. Moreover, while he contended that he started a professional \nrelationship with the debt consolidation company in February 2019, Applicant did not \nclaim that he made any effort to contact any creditors or made any payments in an effort \nto resolve his debts between 2012 and 2019. There are lingering questions if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, and the lengthy \nperiod of non-contact with his creditors, is negative and disappointing. Some of the \ncontinuing questions and doubts might have been satisfied if he had submitted some \nverifying documentation, but he failed to do so. Overall, the evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG \n2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b., and 1.d.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c., and 1.e. through 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 37 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering, and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering and business administration in 2007, 2009 and 2017, respectively. He married and had one child in 2018. He was employed by a federal contractor from June 2009 until early 2021, and has worked for his current employer since March 2021. He was granted a Secret clearance in September 2009 and a Top Secret clearance in 2010. His security clearance was suspended in January 2016. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr. 12-13, 23-36) Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used: marijuana from 2003 to about February 2013, mushrooms from August 2003 to 2012, ecstasy between 2007 and 2009, and cocaine to about 2013; that he purchased cocaine, was cited for THC possession, and, after being granted access to classified information in September 2009, used marijuana, mushrooms, and cocaine (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.g).

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 18, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2022. On \nMarch 8, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing via video teleconference. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on April 5, 2022. Department Counsel offered six exhibits marked as \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 through 6. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and pre-hearing \ndisclosure letter are marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and \noffered two exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and B. There were no objections, \nand all exhibits were admitted in evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nApril 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 37 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering, \nand master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering and business administration in 2007, 2009 \nand 2017, respectively. He married and had one child in 2018. He was employed by a \nfederal contractor from June 2009 until early 2021, and has worked for his current \nemployer since March 2021. He was granted a Secret clearance in September 2009 and \na Top Secret clearance in 2010. His security clearance was suspended in January 2016. \n(GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr. 12-13, 23-36)  \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used: marijuana from 2003 to\nabout February 2013, mushrooms from August 2003 to 2012, ecstasy between 2007 and \n2009, and cocaine to about 2013; that he purchased cocaine, was cited for THC \npossession, and, after being granted access to classified information in September 2009, \nused marijuana, mushrooms, and cocaine (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.g). Under Guideline E, the \nSOR cross-alleges the drug involvement, and that he falsified material facts about that \ndrug involvement on security clearance applications (SCA) executed in 2009, 2010, and \n2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f).

He denied any other illegal use of drugs in the past seven years. In his \n2010 SCA, he also denied using controlled substances while possessing a security \nclearance. In his November 2014 SCA, Applicant denied illegally using controlled \nsubstances in the previous seven years or while possessing a security clearance. He \nreported that in February 2013, he was denied or not granted access by an agency \nbecause \u201c[p]assing a polygraph was required for access [and] I did not pass the \npolygraph.\u201d (GE 1 at 61-65, GE 2, GE 3) \nDuring a July 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant reported \nthat he had failed a polygraph examination in February 2013 because he had not fully \ndisclosed his substance misuse. He said that he had illegally used controlled substances \nuntil about February 2013 and had not recognized the seriousness of his substance \nmisuse until the polygraph examination. He admitted that he used marijuana 3-4 times \nper year from 2003 to 2009 and 1-2 times per year from 2009 until about February 2013. \nHe also admitted that he used cocaine on six different days from about 2007 to 2013, \nusually at New Year\u2019s Eve gatherings with friends, and that he sometimes contributed \nmoney to purchase the cocaine. He said that he used ecstasy once in college, and used \nmushrooms three times from about 2007 to 2012. He stated that he used marijuana \nbecause he did not want to feel left out when his friends smoked, and that he used cocaine \nbecause his friends were doing it and it seemed like fun. His responses to Interrogatories \nand testimony were consistent with his disclosures to the background investigator. (GE 4 \nat 2-3, 10, 13-19; Tr. 32-35, 44-46) \nApplicant stated that he has not illegally used controlled substances since the \nFebruary 2013 polygraph. He said that he has only seen his college friends at special \noccasions like weddings since 2013, has not participated in drug use with them, declined \nany drugs offered, and that they have not offered him drugs since he told them drug usage \nwas incompatible with his career. (GE 4 at 16; Tr. 39) He testified that he met his wife in \n2012, that she disapproved of his drug use, and that he has been a different person since \nmeeting her, moving in together, getting married, and having a child. He has not received \ndrug treatment or counseling. (GE 4; Tr. 32-44) \nApplicant also admitted that he deliberately falsified his 2009, 2010, and 2014 \nSCAs regarding his drug involvement. He said that he falsified information about his drug \nuse in his 2014 SCA because he had previously denied recent drug involvement including \ndrug use while he had a security clearance, and because he did not believe that \nderogatory information that he had disclosed during the polygraph examination would be \nshared with a different agency. He asserted that his acceptance of responsibility, lifestyle \nchanges, good character, desire to support the Defense community, experience, and the \npassage of time supported granting him a security clearance. (GE 4; Tr. 27-54) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor of 3.5 years, who participated in his selection for a \nmanagement position after his security clearance was suspended in 2016 praised \nApplicant\u2019s technical and organizational skills, leadership ability, and commitment to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproduct quality.

(AE A). Applicant\u2019s wife, a medical doctor, noted that when they began \ndating in 2012, he was socially active with friends, that he became much less socially \nactive after they began living together in 2014, and that by 2018, when they married and \nhad a daughter, his outside social activity was rare. She said that she did not condone \nhis past drug activities and had no indications those activities continued during their \nrelationship. She also attested to his dedication to work and more mature social \nbehaviors. (AE B) \nPolicies \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out \nin AG \u00b6 24: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted that he illegally used controlled substances from 2003 until \nabout February 2013 including after he was granted a security clearance, and that he \npurchased cocaine as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.g. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. SOR \u00b6 2.g alleges that Applicant used \u201cmarijuana, \nmushrooms, and cocaine after being granted access to classified information [in] about \n2009,\u201d not \u201cwhile granted access to classified information,\u201d as stated in AG \u00b6 25(f) \n(emphasis added). As such, it does not explicitly allege the conduct identified in AG \u00b6 \n25(f). Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, and the record evidence \nestablishes that he used: marijuana from about 2003 to about February 2013, mushrooms \nfrom about 2003 to about 2012, and cocaine up to New Years\u2019 Eve 2013; that he was \ngranted a Secret clearance in September 2009, granted a Top Secret clearance in 2010, \nand that his security clearance was suspended in January 2016. However, the record \ndoes not establish that his use of controlled substances after he was granted a Secret \nclearance in September 2009 occurred while he was granted access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. \nThe issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for \naccess to classified national security information up to a certain level. Security clearance \neligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain \naccess to specific classified materials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a \nsecurity clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \n\u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd.

Two potentially \napply in this case: \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) and \u00b6 26(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.f. Applicant\u2019s use of ecstasy \nand citation for possession of marijuana were infrequent, happened many years ago, and \nare unlikely to recur. I find his corroborated claims that he has not illegally used controlled \nsubstances since February 2013 credible, and that his substance misuse happened long \nago and is unlikely to recur. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nillegal drug use, has largely disassociated from his drug-using friends, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.f are concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) and \u00b6 26(b) do not apply to SOR \u00b6 2.g. Applicant illegally used \nmarijuana and cocaine on multiple occasions for more than three years after submitting \nhis 2009 SCA, and after he was granted a Secret security clearance. He also used \nmushrooms on at least one occasion during the same timeframe, and continued to \nillegally use controlled substances after submitting his 2010 SCA, and after being granted \na Top Secret clearance. \u201cAn applicant who uses [controlled substances] after having been \nplaced on notice of its security significance, such as using after having completed a \nclearance application, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to \nnational secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

The circumstances of \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of controlled substances while holding a security clearance reflect \npoor judgment and raise questions as to his trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n11-03909 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2012).

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing[.] \nApplicant admitted, and the record reflects, that he deliberately omitted, \nconcealed, or falsified relevant facts in three personnel security questionnaires \nused to determine his national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2. Guideline H is the \nmost appropriate guideline for Applicant\u2019s substance misuse alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a through 2.f; however, his continued illegal use of controlled substances after \nbeing granted access to classified information alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g is equally a \nsecurity concern under Guideline E, and could have, if known, damaged his \npersonal, professional, or community standing, and created a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is established.  \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious, frequent and \noccurred over a period of many years. He misused controlled substances for \napproximately six years before submitting his 2009 SCA, but deliberately falsified \ninformation about the scope of his drug use in that SCA and again in his 2010 SCA. He \ncontinued to illegally use marijuana, cocaine and mushrooms after his 2009 and 2010 \nSCA submissions, and after he was granted a security clearance. Although he claims that \nhe first recognized the seriousness of his drug involvement in February 2013, he chose \nto deliberately falsify material information about his drug involvement again in his 2014 \nSCA, and did not disclose the extent of his illegal drug use and deliberate falsifications \nuntil his July 2017 background interview. His conduct, and explanation that he provided \nfalse responses in his 2014 SCA to be consistent with prior false responses, and because \nhe believed DoD would be unaware of derogatory information from the polygraph \ncontinue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply because Applicant did not obtain counselling and the \nevidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that his deceptive behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, because his disclosures \nabout his substance misuse since 2017, have reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, work record, \ncommitment to family, letters of support, and that he has had no drug involvement since \nFebruary 2013. I considered his history of illegal drug use including after he was granted \naccess to classified information, and his deliberate pattern of deception. I also considered \nthat he deliberately did not disclose his drug use in his 2014 SCA, because he thought \nDoD security officials were unaware of his derogatory 2013 disclosures. His conduct \nraises questions about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E and H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.f:\n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to him by DOHA on August \n30, 2021, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, he \nwas furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to \nhis case. Applicant received the FORM on September 2, 2021.

When Applicant completed his SF 86 in December 2016, he \nreported in Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, that in the last seven years, his use of alcohol \nhad never had a negative impact on his work performance, his professional or personal \nrelationships, his finances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement or public safety \npersonnel. He also denied ever seeking or receiving counseling or treatment related to \nhis use of alcohol. (Item 4, at 30-31) He did, however, report in Section 22 \u2013 Police \nRecord, one alcohol-related incident (an arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2002) \nfor which the charges were subsequently dropped. (Item 4, at 28-29) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement on January 4, 2019. During that interview, he acknowledged that during the \nevening in question, thought to have occurred in August 2002 or possibly October 2004, \nhe had consumed one beer at a bar before driving home with a friend. While on a very \nnarrow road in an area of construction, his vehicle\u2019s side-view mirror collided with the \nside-view mirror of another vehicle. He stopped, but the other driver initially fled the scene \nbut returned. Applicant acknowledged that he was upset and rude to the officer. After \nparticipating in a field-sobriety test \u2013 which he thought he failed \u2013 he was charged with \nDWI, a misdemeanor, on October 28, 2004, arrested, and taken to the local jail. A \nbreathalyzer test was administered to him, and he reportedly blew .06, below the legal \nlimit. He was released the following morning. Applicant eventually went to court \naccompanied by an attorney. He contended that the charge was dismissed, and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Rap Sheet indicated that the prosecutor changed \nthe charge. Applicant was required to pay only court fees and attorney fees totaling \napproximately $3,000. (Item 5, at 3; Item 8, at 5) \nIt is unclear when Applicant actually started consuming alcohol, for he \nacknowledged, as noted above, having done so in either 2002 or 2004. However, during \nthe same interview, Applicant contended that he consumed alcohol while he was in the \nNavy from 2006 until 2012. He denied drinking when he out to sea, during periods of one \nto four weeks at a time. When he had one or two days off, he usually consumed 7 to 10 \nbeers over a 10 to 12-hour period. He enjoyed beer, claimed to have a high tolerance for \nit, and denied drinking to get drunk. He acknowledged becoming intoxicated after \nconsuming a 6-pack of beer in four hours, and he did so on three or four occasions each \nmonth. From 2012 until June 2018, he consumed 6 to 8 beers on his days off, and no \nmore than a case containing 12 beers during a one-week period. (Item 5, at 5-6) \nIn August 2020, Applicant responded to interrogatories. His estimate of alcohol \nconsumption was now reported as two beers a day on his days off and also as never \nmore than a 6-pack at home on days off, and if friends come over, 12 beers with them. \n(Item 5, at 13) He reported that he was last intoxicated in August 2010.

His stated reason to the \ntreatment center for seeking treatment was: \nThe reason I\u2019m here is drinking and driving . . . eventually I\u2019m going to get \npicked up by the police, might kill someone on the road . . . I just don\u2019t give \na shit anymore about anything. \n(Item 7, at 1) \nHe reported his \u201cdrug of choice\u201d was alcohol, and that he had been drinking it for \n13 years. In a separate section he admitted that he had been drinking alcohol since he \nwas 16-years old. He acknowledged drinking \u201cbeer all day every day and I\u2019d throw \nwhiskey on top of it,\u201d quantifying it as 24 beers and 6 shots regularly. In the past 72 hours, \nhe reported that he had consumed 24 beers and 6 shots. His consumption during the past \nten days was reported to be 180 beers and 6 shots total. (Item 7, at 1-2) He admitted that \nhe had not had one sober day in the past seven years. (Item 7, at 16) \nBased on the clinical interviews and testing, Applicant was diagnosed by the \nprofessional staff, in part, with alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use disorder, \nmoderate; schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type; and post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD). A master treatment plan was established and agreed to by Applicant. \nNevertheless, he eventually declined his detoxification medication, stating that he didn\u2019t \nneed it and wanted to be off detox. (Item 7, at 19-20) On his last day of treatment, his \nbehaviors were described as resistive, paranoid, in denial, secretive, and manipulative. \n(Item 7, at 86) He chose to leave the rehabilitation program without having completed it, \nand did so on June 26, 2018, against medical advice. His prognosis was poor. (Item 7, at \n35-36, 88, 98) \nIn January 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) CAF, the predecessor of the \nDCSA CAF, requested a psychological evaluation of Applicant, based on his previous \ndiagnoses, focusing on his mental health and alcohol dependence. A licensed \npsychologist reviewed his medical records, conducted a clinical interview, administered a \nvariety of psychological tests, and made clinical observations. On February 20, 2020, the \npsychologist noted several factors of concern: \n[H]is unwillingness to complete the program increases his chances for \nrelapse in the future. The serious nature of his difficulties related to alcohol \nconsumption, in conjunction with his significant clinical presentation \nresulting in a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type is \nconcerning. These two clinically relevant circumstances necessitated a \npsychological evaluation to assess judgment and reliability. His \nirresponsible drinking behavior almost 2 years ago was likely exacerbated \nby an untreated depressive or anxiety episode for which he self-medicated \nwith alcohol. Further, his failure to seek treatment at the VA for his mood \nsymptoms is concerning. His seemingly inherent tendency for social \nisolation also presented a set of circumstances where his alcohol \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsumption went unnoticed and/or unchecked by others. . . . [H]is failure \nto follow-through with necessary treatment at both the VA and at [the \nprevious rehabilitation center] gives pause because of his inability to \nrecognize psychological symptomatology and to seek treatment for any \ndifficulties he might experience in the future. \n(Item 6, at 4) \nBased on the available information, the psychologist concluded that Applicant did \nnot currently meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition \n(DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for any mental health disorder. Nevertheless, his diagnostic \nprofile was substance-induced psychotic disorder, with severe alcohol use disorder, in \nsustained full remission; alcohol use disorder, severe, by history, by report; and \nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, by history, by report. She also noted that Applicant\u2019s \nfuture focus and ability to verbalize realistic life goals also are consistent \nwith a more mature attitude regarding alcohol consumption. He is very \naware of the potential significant ramifications, both personally and legally, \nif he should revert to past maladaptive behavior patterns regarding alcohol. \nThat said, his risk of relapse is considered above average at this time, \ndespite the 2-year period of responsible drinking in moderation and \nincreased use of adaptive coping skills. Consequently, the prognosis for \n[Applicant] is considered average, at best. \n(Item 6, at 5) \nThe psychologist added that when she attempted to resolve discrepancies \nbetween self-reported, versus documented, substance use history of both alcohol and \nmarijuana, and when she shared his previous medical records, Applicant continued to \npersistently deny any more extensive use of alcohol, saying only that his prior treatment \nproviders must have misunderstood him. As such, she had concerns about Applicant\u2019s \ncandor. (Item 7, at 5) \nOn August 1, 2020, after consulting with the CAF to ensure that she had the fact \npattern correct, the psychologist contacted Applicant to offer him a second opportunity to \nclarify what she considered to be a \u201csignificant discrepancy\u201d between his self-reported \nalcohol and cannabis use and that which was documented in the record. He stuck to his \nearlier story. As such, she saw his substantive lack of candor as a \u201csignificant concern \nregarding his overall trustworthiness.\u201d She added: \u201cIf an individual cannot honestly clarify \nconcerns that are pointed out to him, even when he is aware that the reviewing clinician \nhas the factual medical record in hand, then that speaks poorly to his trustworthiness in \nmy opinion. . . .\u201d (Item 7, at 7) \nOn October 14, 2020, after reviewing Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories \nidentified above, she essentially reversed her opinion and diagnosis: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on his recent admitted ongoing pattern of alcohol consumption, \nwhich is contraindicated by medical recommendations, it is clear that his \nprior significant Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) diagnosis, is not in remission. \nIn this case, he has multiple factors that pose a significant risk to his \njudgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness when performing \nsensitive national security duties or safeguarding classified information \nincluding: 1) a significant alcohol use disorder for which he sought inpatient \nrehabilitation treatment; 2) his inability or unwillingness to complete the \ninpatient treatment program; 3) his inability or unwillingness to engage in \nrecommended follow-up treatment; 4) his previous lack of candor and \ninability or unwillingness to rectify the discrepancy between his reported \nalcohol and substance use with that which is documented in the record; and \n5) his recent self-admission of ongoing maladaptive drinking patterns \nmeeting criteria for an AUD in his response to interrogatories. \n(Item 6, at 8) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant essentially admitted that he had lied to the \npsychologist regarding his alcohol consumption when he claimed he was only consuming \n2-to-3 beers per week, and he was actually consuming up to 12 beers in a single day. \n(Item 3, at 3) He also falsely denied that, as of December 14, 2020, he continued to \nconsume alcohol against the treatment advice and recommendations of the alcohol \nrehabilitation center professional staff. \nOn June 19, 2021, Applicant reentered the residential section of the alcohol \nrehabilitation center. On July 18, 2021, he was discharged after having successfully \ncompleting the addiction recovery coursework and residential treatment program. His \ndischarge diagnosis was alcohol use disorder, severe; and post-traumatic stress disorder, \nunspecified. Among his aftercare follow-up appointments was that he attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings and obtain a sponsor. No prognosis was given. (Item 5, at 22-\n23) In his Response to the FORM, he contended that he has been alcohol free since June \n2021. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nIn addition to his maladaptive use of alcohol, Applicant\u2019s other substance of choice \nwas tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana/cannabis - a Schedule I Controlled \nSubstance. (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c). He \nused marijuana with varying frequency from about 1998 through at least May 2018, and \nsome of that use also took place after he had been granted a security clearance in \nJanuary 2007. (Item 3, at 2) Yet, when he completed his SF 86 in December 2016, he \nfalsely reported in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, that during the last \nseven years, he had not illegally used any drugs or controlled substances. (Item 4, at 29) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, he admitted deliberately falsifying his response.  \nDuring his June 2018 treatment at the drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, he \nreported that he began using marijuana at the age of 16, and that he last used it on June \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30, 2018, when he took a few hits from a vapor pen.

(Item 7, at 13) In his \nAugust 2020 response to interrogatories, he falsely denied ever using cannabis or \nmarijuana. (Item 5, at 10) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had lied. \nDuring his February 2020 psychological evaluation, Applicant stated that he had \nconsumed marijuana in a brownie once or twice in his life, information that was noted to \nbe at odds with the reported use made at the drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. (Item \n6, at 2) In his Answer to the SOR, he admitted deliberately falsifying his response. As \nnoted above, in August 2020, the initial profile of substance-induced psychotic disorder, \nwith severe alcohol use disorder, in sustained full remission, was essentially reversed by \nthe psychologist because of a \u201csignificant discrepancy\u201d between Applicant\u2019s self-reported \nalcohol and cannabis use and that which was documented in the record. (Item 6, at 5, 7) \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse does not appear to have been specifically addressed during his \n2021 inpatient treatment. In his Response to the FORM, he contended that he has been \ndrug free since June 2021. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January \n4, 2019); Item 9 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated May \n3, 2017); Item 10 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 14, 2020); and Item 3 (Answer \nto the SOR, dated January 6, 2021). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant admitted having one delinquent account with a balance of \nabout $1,200, and denied having any other delinquency issues involving routine accounts \nin the last seven years (referring to 2010 \u2013 2016). A review of his 2017 credit report \nindicates that there are actually four delinquent accounts, including the one he reported. \n(Item 9, at 5-6) During his January 2019 OPM interview, Applicant had to be confronted \nwith evidence of the other accounts. He acknowledged them and explained that he was \nunable to pay them because of his lack of education and poor income. He stated that he \nwould contact his creditors within 30 days in an effort to resolve his accounts, or engage \nthe professional services of an attorney to assist him with the collection agencies, or even \nobtain a loan from his parents to pay off his debts quickly. (Item 5, at 4-5) The record is \nsilent as to what resolution actions were ever taken by him. \nThe SOR alleged two still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $13,232, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 3.a. refers to a credit union credit-card account with a past-due and unpaid \nbalance of $6,713 that was placed for collection and charged off. The last payment made \non the account was reported as February 2014. (Item 3, at 5; Item 9, at 5; Item 10, at 2) \nAlthough Applicant promised to start resolving the account during his 2019 OPM \ninterview, he failed to furnish any testimonial or documentary evidence that he has yet \nmade any efforts to do so, despite the passage of approximately three years since the \npromise was made.

The last payment made \non the account was reported as February 2014. (Item 3, at 5; Item 9, at 5; Item 10, at 2) \nApplicant disputed the accuracy of the account, claiming that it was a duplicate charge \nwith fees added. (Item 3, at 5) The account has a separate account number and unpaid \nbalance from the other account with the same creditor. It appears that Applicant was \nconfused because this account is listed by two different credit reporting agencies in his \n2017 credit report, and that data is identical. (Item 9, at 5) Applicant failed to furnish any \ntestimonial or documentary evidence that he has yet made any efforts to dispute the \naccount or resolve it, despite the passage of approximately three years since his OPM \ninterview. The account has not been resolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity his current financial situation. Applicant did not report his net monthly \nincome, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the absence \nof such information, I am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available \nfor savings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial \nproblems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns for Alcohol \nConsumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was charged with and arrested for DWI in 2004. The charge was \neventually dismissed or otherwise resolved, but he had to pay court costs and attorney \nfees. Starting to drink alcohol at the age of 16, he has a lengthy history of habitual and \nbinge consumption of alcohol \u2013 self-reporting 24 beers and 6 shots regularly, or up to 12 \nbeers in one day \u2013 and claiming that he had not had one sober day in a seven-year period. \nHe was diagnosed by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional with alcohol \nuse disorder, severe, and was evaluated on several occasions. He chose to leave one \nrehabilitation program without having completed it, against medical advice, and he \ncontinued consuming alcohol, also against treatment recommendations. \nHe was evaluated by a psychologist in 2020, and it was determined that he had \nrepeatedly failed to be candid \u2013 in fact he lied \u2013 about his alcohol consumption history. \nHis eventual diagnosis was alcohol use disorder, severe, and the prognosis was poor. In \n2021, he was readmitted to the alcohol rehabilitation center, and successfully completed \nthe addiction recovery coursework. His diagnosis was alcohol-use disorder, severe. \nAmong the recommended aftercare follow-up appointments were that he attend AA \nmeetings and obtain a sponsor.

Aside from his unverified claim in his Response to the FORM that he \nhas been alcohol free since June 2021, he failed to demonstrate any pattern of altered \nalcohol consumption, much less a clear and established pattern of modified consumption \nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. His maladaptive use of \nalcohol as well as his lack of candor, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical or mental health professional; \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nI \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser of a Schedule \nControlled Substance - marijuana. He used marijuana from about 1998 through at least \nMay 2018 with varying frequency. Considering his comment set forth in his Response to \nthe FORM that he has been drug free since June 2021, it appears that he may have \ncontinued using marijuana after May 2018. Unfortunately, because of his lack of candor \nwith the professionals seeking to evaluate or treat him, the accuracy of his repeatedly \nchanging history of drug use is difficult to pin down. During part of that period he held a \nsecurity clearance. During his June 2018 treatment at the drug and alcohol rehabilitation \ncenter, he reported that he began using marijuana at the age of 16, and that he last used \nit on June 30, 2018, when he took a few hits from a vapor pen. One of the clinical \nimpressions was that he \u201cmay be minimizing his cannabis use.\u201d He was diagnosed with \ncannabis use disorder, moderate. He chose to leave the rehabilitation program without \nhaving completed it, against medical advice. \nIn his August 2020 response to interrogatories, Applicant falsely denied ever using \ncannabis or marijuana. In his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that he had lied. During \nhis February 2020 psychological evaluation, he stated that he had consumed marijuana \nin a brownie once or twice in his life, information that was noted to be at odds with the \nreported use made at the drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. In his Answer to the SOR, \nhe also admitted deliberately falsifying that response as well. In August 2020, the initial \nprofile of substance-induced psychotic disorder, with severe alcohol use disorder, in \nsustained full remission, was essentially reversed by the psychologist because of a \n\u201csignificant discrepancy\u201d between Applicant\u2019s self-reported alcohol and cannabis use and \nthat which was documented in the record. Although he successfully completed the drug \nand alcohol rehabilitation center\u2019s addiction recovery coursework and residential \ntreatment program in July 2021, Applicant\u2019s drug abuse does not appear to have been \nspecifically addressed during that 2021 inpatient treatment program. Although he claimed \nto be drug free since June 2021, he failed to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(d), 25(e), 25(f), and 25(g) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(d) partially applies but neither of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nAfter approximately two decades of marijuana use, continuing until at least May 2018, \nand possibly as recently as June 2021, Applicant now claims he has been drug free. As \nnoted above, his candor regarding his history of marijuana use is extremely poor, and he \nhas admittedly falsified questions regarding that history. Other than his two efforts at \nseeking drug treatment in 2018 and 2021, he never provided evidence of actions taken \nto overcome this problem. Aside from his recent statement in Response to the FORM, \nthere is no verifiable evidence to support his claimed abstinence from drugs. He has never \naddressed any disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; or changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used. Furthermore, he never provided a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \napproximately two decades of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of one-half year \nof reported abstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence will \ncontinue, especially considering his lack of candor. Applicant seemingly ignored laws, \nrules, and regulations regarding such use. Some of his marijuana use occurred while he \nheld a security clearance, despite the fact that such use was prohibited by both the \nFederal Government and government contractors. His drug use, especially while holding \na security clearance, as well as his lack of candor, continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \nThe SOR alleged two still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $13,232. \nApplicant acknowledged them and explained that he was unable to pay them because of \nhis lack of education and poor income. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but \nthere is no evidence to support the establishment of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b). \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant stated that he was unable to pay \nhis still-delinquent bills \u2013 both of which remained unpaid since 2014 \u2013 because of his lack \nof education and poor income. He indicated to the OPM investigator in January 2019 that \nhe would contact his creditors within 30 days in an effort to resolve his accounts, or \nengage the professional services of an attorney to assist him with the collection agencies, \nor even obtain a loan from his parents to pay off his debts quickly. The record is silent as \nto what resolution actions were ever taken by him. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date of the OPM interview in January 2019 \nand the date of his response to the FORM in September 2021, he made no claimed or \nverifiable efforts to address either of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts for a substantial multi-year period. Because of his failure to address either \naccount over the entire period, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that \nhis financial problems are not under control or that he is not truly interested in resolving \nthem. He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts and by \nfailing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditor. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts in \nthe past three years. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness.

An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, since he made the statements \nto the OPM investigator, Applicant offered no specifics regarding any repayment efforts; \nsubmitted no documentary evidence to reflect any payments made; and only made \npromises of proposed actions. Neither delinquent debt has been resolved. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them after August 2019, is \nsufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. The timeliness of \nhis efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing to do so, is \nanother negative factor. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget.

The following will normally result in \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and financial considerations, are adopted herein. In fact, some of the \nallegations under Guideline E are identical to the ones under Guidelines G, H, and F, and \nthe credible adverse information alleged under those guidelines is sufficient for an \nadverse determination solely under those individual guidelines. In addition, as noted \nabove, Applicant deliberately falsified and/or omitted material facts on his SF 86 in 2016; \nhe falsified and/or omitted material facts regarding his histories of drug use and alcohol \nconsumption when he was being evaluated by a licensed psychologist in 2020; and he \nfalsified and/or omitted material facts in his 2020 response to the interrogatories. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. It includes: \n18 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nNone of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use, his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse; his use of marijuana while he held a security \nclearance, his financial considerations, and his repeated lack of candor and deliberate \nfalsifications and omissions, raise significant concerns about him and continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n19 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 39-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a security guard with his \ncurrent employer since August 2014. He previously worked for other employers as a \nmetal worker (June 2014 \u2013 August 2014), and as a county sheriff jailer (April 2014 \u2013 June \n2014). He briefly attended a community college for three months in 2013, but did not \nreceive a degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in September 2006 and remained on active \nduty until October 2012 when he was honorably discharged. He reportedly received an \n80% disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in January 2007. He claims that he has abstained from marijuana and \nalcohol since June 2021. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply much more \nsubstantial. Applicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice were \nmarijuana and alcohol. Starting to drink alcohol at the age of 16, he has a lengthy history \nof habitual and binge consumption of alcohol \u2013 self-reporting 24 beers and 6 shots \nregularly, or up to 12 beers in one day \u2013 and claiming that he had not had one sober day \nin a seven-year period. He used marijuana from about 1998 through at least May 2018, \nand possibly up to June 2021, including during a period in which he held a security \nclearance. In June 2018, he was diagnosed by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional with alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use disorder, moderate; \nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar type; and post-traumatic stress disorder. He chose to \nleave the rehabilitation program without having completed it, against medical advice, and \nhe continued consuming alcohol, also against treatment recommendations. \nIn August 2020, a psychologist\u2019s initial profile of Applicant\u2019s substance-induced \npsychotic disorder, with severe alcohol use disorder, in sustained full remission, was \nessentially reversed by the psychologist because of a \u201csignificant discrepancy\u201d between \nApplicant\u2019s self-reported alcohol and cannabis use and that which was documented in the \nrecord. Applicant deliberately falsified and/or omitted material facts on his SF 86 in 2016; \nhe falsified and/or omitted material facts regarding his histories of drug use and alcohol \nconsumption when he was being evaluated by a licensed psychologist in 2020; and he \n20 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nfalsified and/or omitted material facts in his 2020 response to the interrogatories. He has \ntaken no positive actions to resolve two delinquent accounts since he promised to resolve \nthem three years ago. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n21 \n",

There is no new \ninformation cited under this Guideline. \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may \nbe made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), and 31(b). Applicant was involved \nin two alcohol-related arrests in 2012 and in 2017, four arrests for disorderly conduct in \n2013, 2014, 2015, and in 2018, and she has a history of other minor offenses. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the trustworthiness concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct raises serious trustworthiness concerns, \nand calls into question her ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations. She has a long \nhistory of multiple offenses that occurred from approximately 2011 through 2018. She \nhas also demonstrated several positive changes she made to improve her quality of life. \nShe moved to a different part of town and no longer associates with her old friends. She \nrarely consumes alcohol and is involved in her daughters\u2019 after school activities. She is \nnewly married and believes she has matured and is now more responsible. She has \nalso been successful in her job. She was promoted in 2021 to a clinical support \ncoordinator position with a pay increase. Four years have passed since her last criminal \noffense.

Criminal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the trustworthiness concern about alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides a condition that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant was arrested for \noperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in 2012 and in 2017. In \n2014 she was charged with [being? having? a]passenger with open container. She \nadmitted some of her other criminal offenses took place after she had been drinking \nalcohol. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists two conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant has not been involved in any alcohol-related offenses since 2018. She \nhas demonstrated a clear pattern of modified and responsible alcohol use. I find that \nsufficient time has passed without any alcohol-related offenses, and that Applicant is \nunlikely to be involved in alcohol-related incidents in the future.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified (or sensitive) \ninformation. \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \n\u00b6 19: \n (a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or \nactions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant developed financial issues due to unemployment, underemployment, \nand a lack of maturity. She successfully disputed two delinquent accounts totaling \n$1,825 with a cellular service company and a child care center. The significant financial \nconcern, however, is that she indebted to the U.S. Department of Education in the \namount of $40,443 for ten unpaid student loans that had been referred for collection. \nApplicant obtained student loans to enroll in college, and in 2006, she earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree. The loans were placed in forbearance. After she became employed \nin November 2018, she initiated a payment plan with her student loan creditor to deduct \npayments directly from her paycheck. She provided documentation that verified loan \npayments were taken from her paychecks from mid-2019 to March 2020, when the \ndeductions automatically stopped due to the COVID-19 student loan payment pause. \nThis federal relief is in effect until December 31, 2022. It is Applicant\u2019s intention to \nresume her student loan payments in January 2023. It is important to note that Applicant \ntook the initiative to contact the student loan creditor, and she adhered to a good-faith \npayment plan to resolve her student loans well before the SOR was issued. Financial \nconsideration trustworthiness concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that could raise a trustworthiness \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nGuideline J SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.bb are cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. Each of them is established by the record evidence and addressed under \nthe appropriate guideline. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct supports application of \nAG \u00b6 16(c). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns in this \ncase: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nAs stated under Guideline J, Applicant has taken positive steps to eliminate \ncomplications from her life. She moved to a different part of town, no longer associates \nwith old friends, and she drinks alcohol in a responsible manner. In 2021, she was \npromoted by her employer and given a pay raise. Four years have passed since her last \ncriminal offense. I find there is sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct will not recur. Personal conduct trustworthiness concerns \nare mitigated. \n  Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n    \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, G, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant took positive action to turn her life around. She has not been involved \nin criminal conduct over the last four years, and she took positive steps to resolve her \nfinancial delinquencies, well before the SOR was issued. Her financial issues are \ncurrently under control. I find that future delinquencies and criminal misconduct are \nunlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated all of the trustworthiness concerns alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i,  \n1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, 1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 4.a,\nand 4.b:\nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, \n1.n, 1.o, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, 1.y, 1.aa,\nand 1.bb: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.l:   \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.c:     \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Dr. B said that Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis was poor based on limited insight and absence on ongoing care for psychiatric \nconditions, which suggested an increased risk for instability that can lead to impairment \nin judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Guideline I (psychological conditions) are not \nmitigated at this time. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 16, 2016, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application \n(SCA).

(AE L at 145) Applicant denied any mental-health issues before \n2005; however, he was the victim of sexual abuse around age six. (Tr. 107, 129) \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother was schizophrenic. (Tr. 128) Both of his parents have suffered \nfrom depression. (GE 3 at 4) \nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s grandfather died, and friends who were military aviators died \nin accidents at Fort Hood, Texas and Iraq. (Tr. 89) Applicant was engaged; however, the \nengagement was not going well. (Tr. 89) He was taking pain medications after his knee \nsurgery. (Tr. 89) He was also dissatisfied with his employment. (GE 2 at 3) In 2005, \nApplicant sought help from a general practitioner and was diagnosed with depression \nand Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and he was prescribed Cymbalta, an anti-\ndepressant. (Tr. 88, 106-108; GE 2 at 3) He took Cymbalta for a week or two. (Tr. 108) \nHe began to think about committing suicide. (Tr. 90, 130) His father took him back to see \nhis doctor. (GE 2 at 3) He learned when he went back to see his treating physician that \nhe mistakenly received an excessively large dose of Cymbalta. (Tr. 91) A flight surgeon \nadvised him to stop taking Cymbalta and then to see how he felt. (Tr. 91) He complied \nwith the flight surgeon\u2019s advice.  \nIn 2006, Applicant was feeling lethargic and tired, and he went to see another \ngeneral practitioner. (Tr. 91; AE L at 45) He was diagnosed with depression and possibly \nADD. (Tr. 91) He was prescribed antidepressants and Ritalin for ADD. (Tr. 91, 110) The \nside effects of the medications made Applicant feel worse, and despite medication \nchanges, he was not improving. \nLater in 2006, Applicant went to see Dr. D, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with \na Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 93) Applicant said for the first time he experienced episodes of \nmania. (Tr. 111-112) He tried multiple mood stabilizers. (Tr. 112) He slept about three \nhours over a four-day period, and he said his inability to sleep was due to taking Ritalin \nmedication. (Tr. 112-113; GE 2 at 3) Applicant believed the idea that he was manic \noriginated from his reaction to Ritalin. (Tr. 131) He felt \u201clike Superman.\u201d (Tr. 131) Dr. D \ndescribed Applicant as honest, candid, and reliable. (Tr. 92-93; AE L at 45, 154) Dr. D \nsaid Applicant does not have a condition or treatment that could impair his judgment or \nreliability, particularly in the context of safeguarding national security information. (AE L \nat 154) Dr. D retired in 2008, and Applicant next saw Dr. E for about nine months.

(Tr. 114) Applicant said Dr. F told him he was not \nreally sure the correct diagnosis was Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 114) Applicant continued to \nfeel tired and lethargic; however, he did not feel depressed. (Tr. 115) Dr. F continued to \nprescribe Lamictal, and Applicant took the medication because he was doing well with \nthis medication. (Tr. 114; GE 2 at 3) Dr. F recommended follow-up appointments every \nsix months or so to monitor how he was doing, and Applicant complied with this treatment \nrecommendation. (Tr. 115) In November 2010, he stopped seeing Dr. F because he was \nmoved to a different state. Medical records from Dr. F were not introduced into the \nsecurity record. \nDr. M, a psychiatrist, treated Applicant from April 2011 to October 2016. (Tr. 93; \nAE L at 45) In April 2011, Dr. M wrote in Applicant\u2019s medical records that he \npresented with life long history of episodes of irritable & happy mood, \nexcessive [e]nergy, decreased need for sleep and increase[d] sex drive. \n[Patient (Pt)] also had episodes of getting depressed and irritable. Pt \nreported having disturbed sleep and appetite, loss of interest in activity of \ndaily living, lack of motivation, multiple episodes of anxiety attacks, and \nmultiple episodes of crying spells. . . . Pt also presented with history of \nfeeling anxious and having frequent panic attacks. Pt has also a long history \nof paying attention to details, difficulty completing prolonged tasks, difficulty \ninitiating complex tasks, easily frustrated, and easily bored. (GE 4 at 1) \nDr. M diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I Disorder (mixed type) in remission, ADD, \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depression in remission, and Obsessive \nCompulsive Personality (OCP) traits. (Tr. 93-94, 116; AE L at 45; SOR \u00b6 1.a) Dr. M \nprescribed Lamictal for mood stabilization and Vyvanse for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity \ndisorder (ADHD). (Tr. 116) \nOn July 25, 2013, Dr. M noted that Applicant \u201cis doing well. Anxiety and mood \nlevel is great. Illness history of Bipolar course was reviewed with [Applicant] with clear \nhistory of manic or hypomanic episodes but ocp traits and anxiety and recurrent \ndepressive episodes. No side effects from meds. Supportive and individual therapy was \nprovided.\u201d He changed his diagnosis to Major Depression in remission, ADHD, and \nObsessive Compulsive Personality (OCP) traits. (Tr. 95; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M reduced the \nLamictal prescription from 150 mg to 100 mg for mood stabilization and Adderall for \nADHD. (Tr. 117; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M noted Applicant\u2019s judgment was logical and his mood \nwas stable. (Tr. 96; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M advised the OPM investigator that he was not \nconfident about the Bipolar Disorder diagnosis and the correct diagnosis might be \nAnxiety, Depression, ADD, and OCD traits. (AE L at 45) \nApplicant followed all prescribed or recommended treatment from April 2011 to \nOctober 2014, and from October 2014 to February 2016.

(Tr. 119)  \nIn November 2017, Applicant went to Europe with his spouse, and he forgot his \nmedications. (Tr. 97) He discovered he felt better without his medications.

(GE 2 at 1) In April 2020, Dr. B generated \na psychological report for the DOD CAF. (GE 2) Dr. B considered Applicant\u2019s background \ninformation, her clinical interview and observations of Applicant, and Applicant\u2019s \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Dr. B provided a detailed mental-health history \nof Applicant, and she diagnosed him with Bipolar II Disorder, Depressive Disorder \n(moderate, recurrent, in partial remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive \nCompulsive Personality traits. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 2 at 5) Dr. B did not interview Applicant\u2019s \nspouse or coworkers. (Tr. 99-101) Dr. B explained the reasons for her diagnosis as \nfollows: \nApplicant\u2019s presentation was inconsistent with his psychological test results, \nas he certainly is quite anxious, ruminative, and possibly hypomanic at this \ntime. His insight is clearly lacking and his fixation on \u201cblood sugar issues\u201d \nand diet as opposed to voicing awareness of his psychiatric diagnoses is \nconcerning. He describes a history of at least one hypomanic episode that \nhe claims was the result of taking Ritalin as prescribed, although that is \nhighly unlikely. He also describes numerous episodes of depression. \nTherefore, I find that the prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder is appropriate. It \ndoes not seem plausible that he has ADHD in my opinion, as he does not \ndescribe his attention as being problematic until adulthood. I suspect his \nattentional issues are related to his other psychiatric conditions.  GE 2 at 5-\n6. \nDr. B\u2019s prognosis is as follows: \nThe [A]pplicant\u2019s prognosis is poor, based on his limited insight and the \nabsence of ongoing care for psychiatric conditions. This suggests increased \nrisk for instability, which can lead to impairment in judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. (GE 2 at 5-6) \nDr. S assessed Applicant\u2019s mental-health at Applicant\u2019s request. (Tr. 25-31) Dr. S \nis a licensed clinical social worker who has a Ph.D. in psychology. He has never held an \nactive license in psychology \u201cbecause I can\u2019t make [any] money doing that.\u201d (Tr. 32) His \nonly testimony involved cases about the need for longer stays in hospitals. (Tr. 32) He \nsaid he has seen Applicant regularly about once a week since December 1, 2020, or \nperhaps it was about 20 times over 18 months. (Tr. 28-29) From December 1, 2020, to \nJanuary 6, 2021, he said \u201c[s]even sessions have been completed and no symptoms of \nBipolar Disorder have been detected during this time. Neither have any other serious \nsymptoms been uncovered during our sessions.\u201d (AE F) Applicant said Dr. S\u2019s sessions \nwere about every two to four weeks. (Tr. 126) Dr. S did not review Applicant\u2019s past \nmedical records. (Tr. 36, 41) He was unaware that Applicant experienced symptoms of \nBipolar and Major Depressive Disorder for several years.

(Tr. 40) In response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s question about not sleeping much for four days, Dr. S said he was \naware of this fact \u201cbut I don\u2019t see that \u2013 I\u2019ve done that, nobody is labeling me bipolar.\u201d \n(Tr. 40) \nDr. S most recently saw Applicant for a 50-minute clinical appointment on May 11, \n2022, or May 13, 2022. (Tr. 34) He also saw Applicant on April 15, 2022, and on May 5, \n2022. (Tr. 51) He based his diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d on his interview of \nApplicant, his spouse, and his coworkers. (Tr. 33, 36) He noted in his report that Applicant \n\u201cdiscontinued his prescriptions for bipolar three years ago due to visiting out of country \nand, serendipitously, having forgotten to bring his medications. No symptoms of bipolar \nappeared when the medications were not taken. This is attested to by his above average \nperformance and being symptom free at work and at home.\u201d (Tr. 44; AE F) Dr. S \nsuggested that Applicant was inconsistent about going to his appointments from 2011 to \n2016 because Applicant \u201cthinks he\u2019s found the cause and a solution. He stopped the \nmeds, I know that . . . I don\u2019t know the details of why he would do that, I have no idea. I \ndidn\u2019t know that, but I can\u2019t imagine being worried about it when you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d (Tr. \n46) \nDr. S\u2019s diagnosis is that Applicant does not meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder. \n(AE F) He is almost perfectionistic. (Tr. 35, 46-47) He did not talk to anyone who \npreviously diagnosed Applicant. (Tr. 34) He does not provide \u201ca serious diagnosis like \nbipolar or schizophrenic, [he] always asks for a second opinion.\u201d (Tr. 35) Applicant is not \ntaking any medications. (Tr. 28) Applicant is \u201cdoing beautifully.\u201d (Tr. 29) He \nrecommended that Applicant continue with talk therapy and psychotherapy because he \nbelieves \u201call folks could continue with talk therapy.\u201d (Tr. 34-35) He recommended that \nApplicant see a mental-health provider every 15 to 30 days \u201cfor his own mental growth, \nif he chooses, not because he really needs it, because he\u2019s trying to grow, to understand \nhimself.\u201d (Tr. 49) His recommendation is that Applicant see a mental-health provider \nwhenever Applicant deems it necessary or \u201cas needed.\u201d (Tr. 50) He believes Applicant \nis trustworthy. (Tr. 29) Applicant received inconsistent diagnoses over the years, and \nbipolar disease is frequently incorrectly diagnosed. (Tr. 30) Incorrect prescriptions can \nhave adverse medical effects. (Tr. 30) Cymbalta is prescribed for depression; however, \nit can trigger suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 31) \nDr. S was focused on Applicant\u2019s current behavior and how he was performing at \nwork, and not on his mental-health history. (Tr. 41) He said he did not care about \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis from three years ago. (Tr. 41) He acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s a \npossibility that they [will] fall back to where they were, but there\u2019s somebody trying to \nsurvive now. That\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned with is now and the behavior.\u201d (Tr. 41) \nApplicant does not have any concerns about his mental health, and he has not \ntaken any medications for his mental health since November 2017. (Tr. 104, 119; SOR \nresponse, \u00b6 D.III) He does not believe he has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Tr. 130) \nHe does not believe he has a chronic mental illness, and he does not believe he needs \npsychiatric care. (Tr. 106, 120) He decided not to return to see Dr. M in 2017 after \nconsulting with his spouse who does not have any training in psychology.

(Tr. 121-122) He wanted to do whatever he needed \nto do to resolve security concerns. (Tr. 122) He told his facility security officer (FSO) \nwhen the issue of his mental health first arose, and Applicant said \u201c[e]ssentially that \nbefore he had a diagnosis that he later attributed to blood sugar and not the diagnosis \nhe was given.\u201d (Tr. 60) Applicant told his FSO that he stopped following treatment \nrecommendations and taking his medications without communicating with his treatment \nprovider. (Tr. 61-62) The FSO did not recommend whether he should follow medical \nadvice or tell him that he needed to communicate with his treatment provider about not \ntaking his medications. (Tr. 62) He relied upon his FSO for advice on security matters. \n(Tr. 122) His FSO did not consider him a threat to national security. (Tr. 62-63) \nApplicant did not know what to do when he received the SOR. (Tr. 123) He sought \nadvice from supervisors in his company. (Tr. 123-124) They suggested he seek an \nopinion from a third party, and he sought assistance from Dr. S. (Tr. 124) He provided \nhis medical records to Dr. S. (Tr. 125) Dr. S told Applicant he might have situational \ndepression in 2005 because of stress. (Tr. 125-126) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant presented three character witnesses at his hearing and 16 written \nstatements from his coworkers, friends, pastor and spouse. (Tr. 53-79; AE G) The \ngeneral sense of their statements is that Applicant is friendly, reliable, diligent, \nprofessional, responsible, detail oriented, and trustworthy. (Id.) They did not provide any \nnegative information about his mental health, work performance, and disciplinary actions. \n(Id.) He is a valued asset to his company who makes important contributions to his \ncompany. (Id.) He supports his spouse and his community. (Id.) His work performance is \noutstanding. (Id.)

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(d); however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(c) \nare not established. Further details will be discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

He followed all prescribed or recommended \ntreatment from April 2011 to October 2014, from October 2014 to February 2016, and \nfrom January 2020 to present. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(b) and 29(c) do not fully apply \nbecause there is no evidence Dr. S was acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, and he did not establish he is \u201ca duly qualified mental health professional.\u201d \nDr. S did not review Applicant\u2019s medical records and showed little interest in his mental-\nhealth history. His diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d was inconsistent with the other \ndiagnoses of multiple mental-health experts who treated Applicant from 2005 to 2017. \nOn July 25, 2013, Dr. M said Applicant \u201cis doing well.

(DSM-5 at 123) \nThe Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar I disorder is as follows: \nFor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following \ncriteria for a manic/episode. The manic episode may have been preceded \nby and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. \nManic Episode \nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or \nirritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed \nactivity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly \nevery day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). \nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, \nthree (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) \nare present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from \nusual behavior: \n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. \n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). \n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. \n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. \n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant \nexternal stimuli), as reported or observed. \n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or \nsexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed \nactivity). \n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful \nconsequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual \nindiscretions, or foolish business investments). \n12 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment \nin social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to \nprevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. \nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance \n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical \ncondition.  \nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment \n(e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully \nsyndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is \nsufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. \nNote: Criteria A-D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic \nepisode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. (DSM-5 at 123-\n124) \nThe Diagnostic Criteria in DSM-5 for Major Depressive Disorder is as \nfollows: \nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the \nsame 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at \nleast one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of \ninterest or pleasure. \nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another \nmedical condition. \n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated \nby either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation \nmade by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, \ncan be irritable mood.) \n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, \nactivities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective \naccount or observation). \n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a \nchange of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or \nincrease in appetite nearly every day. \n(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.) \n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. \n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by \nothers, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed \ndown). \n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. \n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt \n(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or \nguilt about being sick). \n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly \nevery day (either by subjective account or as observed by others). \n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent \nsuicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific \nplan for committing suicide. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment \nin social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a \nsubstance or to another medical condition. \nNote: Criteria A-C represent a major depressive episode. \nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, \nlosses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may \ninclude the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, \ninsomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may \nresemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be \nunderstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a \nmajor depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant \nloss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires \nthe exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual\u2019s history and the \ncultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss. \nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better \nexplained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform \ndisorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified \nschizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. \nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. \nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-\nlike episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological \neffects of another medical condition. (DSM-5 at 160-161) \nA manic or depressive episode may result in behavior that casts doubt on an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, and it may result in an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible \nbehavior or self-harm. A person in the throes of a manic or depressive episode might \njeopardize national security.  See DSM-5. \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 19-00151 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019) the Appeal Board affirmed \nthe grant of a security clearance in a case involving conflicting expert mental-health \nwitness opinions, and cogently explained the necessity of reconciling opposing expert \nwitness opinions stating: \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndeciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See. e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-0288 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

The record documents a history of multiple depressive episodes and at least \none manic episode. Dr. S\u2019s diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d and the resulting \nprognosis are unreliable because he did not review Applicant\u2019s mental-health records, \nconsult with previous treatment providers, or perform psychological testing. Moreover, \nhe was an evasive witness. For example, one of the criteria for a manic episode is \n\u201cDecreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\u201d (DSM-5 at \n123-124) In response to Department Counsel\u2019s question about this symptom, Dr. S said \nhe was aware of this fact \u201cbut I don\u2019t see that \u2013 I\u2019ve done that, nobody is labeling me \nbipolar.\u201d (Tr. 40) He did not explain how he factored in this symptom in his diagnosis in \nlight of the DSM-5 criteria. \nDr. B opined, \u201cThe [A]pplicant\u2019s prognosis is poor, based on his limited insight and \nthe absence of ongoing care for psychiatric conditions. This suggests increased risk for \ninstability, which can lead to impairment in judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 6) Applicant did not go to any appointments with Dr. M from October 24, 2014, \nto March 30, 2016, and from 2017 to December 2020. He did not seek mental-health \ntreatment advice before stopping his use of Lamictal. In December 2020, he started \nseeing Dr. S, who supported his notion that his mental-health problems related to diet, \nand he did not have bipolar disorder or any other serious mental-health disorder. I am \nnot convinced that Dr. S was providing sound medical advice to Applicant about \ntreatment of his mental-health disorders. \nI have lingering concerns that Applicant\u2019s mental-health condition may impair his \njudgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. He may miss future appointments, not \naccept the diagnosis of competent mental-health practitioners, elect to stop taking \nprescribed medication, and a depressive or manic episode may result with an adverse \nimpact on national security. Security concerns under Guideline I are not mitigated at this \ntime. \nWhole-Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Applicant\u2019s acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n15 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior field test engineer, and he has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a DOD contractor managing laboratories developing simulators and \nfielding manuals for devices for the Army for six years. From 2005 to 2015, Applicant \nworked for DOD contractors training helicopter pilots on simulators, supported engineers \nin a development environment, and worked with simulators for another DOD contractor. \nHe served in the Army National Guard from 1996 to 2005, and he was honorably \ndischarged as a Chief Warrant Officer 2 in 2005. He was an Apache helicopter mechanic \nand pilot. He served a tour in Kuwait from 1999 to 2000. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1997. There is no evidence of security violations. He has never received any \nadverse employment actions such as reprimands or suspensions. \nThe general sense of his character statements is that Applicant is friendly, reliable, \ndiligent, professional, responsible, detail oriented, and trustworthy. They did not provide \nany negative information about his mental health, work performance, and disciplinary \nactions. He is a valued asset to his company. He supports his spouse and his community. \nHis work performance is outstanding. Their statements support his continued access to \nclassified information. \nApplicant received mental-health counseling and was prescribed drugs to stabilize \nhis mood from 2005 to 2017. In 2017, he unilaterally decided that he would stop taking \nprescribed medications and he would stop attending appointments with Dr. M. He did not \ncommunicate about these decisions with Dr. M. On October 30, 2020, the SOR was \nissued, and in December 2020, he elected to see Dr. S to help him present favorable \nevidence to improve his chances of maintaining his security clearance. Dr. M, Dr. S, and \nApplicant do not believe he has a mental-health diagnosis that raises security concerns. \nDr. B provided a detailed mental-health history of Applicant, and she diagnosed \nhim with Bipolar II Disorder, Depressive Disorder (moderate, recurrent, in partial \nremission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality traits. \nDr. B opined that \u201cThe [A]pplicant\u2019s prognosis is poor, based on his limited insight and \nthe absence of ongoing care for psychiatric conditions. This suggests increased risk for \ninstability, which can lead to impairment in judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (GE \n2 at 5-6) Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis are given greater weight than the other \ndiagnoses and prognoses of record. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \n16 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $18,386 for 23 delinquent or past-due medical debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.w), and that she owed $16,969 for the delinquent remainder after a car repossession (SOR 1.x). The Government also alleged that Applicant did not timely file her federal income tax returns for the 2008 through 2016 tax years (SOR 1.y). In her response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with explanations all of the SOR allegations. In her Answer, Applicant claimed that the debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.j, and 1.t had been paid or otherwise resolved. In support of these responses, she included documents supporting her claims, but only as to SOR 1.c and 1.e. Regarding SOR 1.g \u2013 1.j, Applicant averred that those debts were paid by her attorney. In support of this claim, she provided information documenting a lawsuit settlement whereby her debts to a medical facility totaling $35,700 were resolved through a single payment of $15,000 in October 2017. Applicant denied the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.k \u2013 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, and 1.v, stating that she was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with those accounts and did not have any 2 information about them.

Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 14, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \npossible employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not, as required by \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, \nas amended (Directive), Section 4.2, make an affirmative determination that it is clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. \nOn January 4, 2021, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was one of the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on November 19, 2021, and I convened the requested hearing \nvia web-based video conferencing on December 14, 2021. \nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and produced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 G. I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 22, 2021. \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of GX 4, a summary of Applicant\u2019s personal \nsubject interviews (PSI) by a government investigator in November and December 2019, \non grounds of relevance. She otherwise agreed that the summary was accurate and that \nshe would be willing to adopt it as her own statement. I overruled her objection and \nadmitted GX 4. (Tr. 22 \u2013 31) Department Counsel objected to AX A because the letters \ncontained therein were not signed and should not carry persuasive value. I overruled that \nobjection and admitted AX A. (Tr. 32 \u2013 33) The remaining exhibits proffered by both \nparties were admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $18,386 for 23 \ndelinquent or past-due medical debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.w), and that she owed $16,969 for the \ndelinquent remainder after a car repossession (SOR 1.x). The Government also alleged \nthat Applicant did not timely file her federal income tax returns for the 2008 through 2016 \ntax years (SOR 1.y). In her response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with \nexplanations all of the SOR allegations. \nIn her Answer, Applicant claimed that the debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.j, \nand 1.t had been paid or otherwise resolved. In support of these responses, she included \ndocuments supporting her claims, but only as to SOR 1.c and 1.e. Regarding SOR 1.g \u2013 \n1.j, Applicant averred that those debts were paid by her attorney. In support of this claim, \nshe provided information documenting a lawsuit settlement whereby her debts to a \nmedical facility totaling $35,700 were resolved through a single payment of $15,000 in \nOctober 2017. Applicant denied the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.k \u2013 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, \nand 1.v, stating that she was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with those accounts and did not have any \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ninformation about them. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been sponsored for a security clearance by a \ndefense contractor for whom she will work if her request for a clearance is granted. \nApplicant attended a state university between 2003 and 2008 but did not earn a degree. \nShe then studied at a technical training school to be a medical assistant between October \nand December 2012, but did not complete those studies either. Starting in March 2018, \nApplicant studied for a degree in intelligence studies, which she received in December \n2021. (GX 1; GX 4; AX H) \nBetween January 2008 and April 2009, Applicant worked as a restaurant server \nand as an optometry technician. Between April 2009 and July 2012, she worked as an \nassistant in a business run by her boyfriend. She left that job when they broke up. For the \nnext five months, she worked as a certified medical assistant but left that job when she \nbecame sick and required surgery in November 2012. Applicant\u2019s illness was a condition \nshe first developed around 2000 and for which she has had multiple surgeries starting in \n2002. Applicant was unemployed between January and April 2013, after which she \nstarted working at an environmental engineering company owned by her father. She \nworked there until January 2016, but she claims she received no pay. Instead, she claims \nher father paid for her room and board and other expenses, including her medical bills. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 4; AX E; Tr. 43 \u2013 45, 85 \u2013 89) \nIn January 2016, Applicant started working as an executive assistant with a \ncompany in the healthcare industry. On May 17, 2016, she and her boss were driving \nfrom a business meeting when they were involved in a car accident that left Applicant with \ninjuries to her arm, shoulder, and neck. Having no medical insurance, her subsequent \nmedical expenses totaled at least $35,000, but were resolved for $15,000 from the \nproceeds of a settlement she received in November 2017. That settlement totaled \n$100,000, of which Applicant received $60,000 in November 2017 after medical expenses \nand legal fees. Since May 2016, Applicant has supported herself using those settlement \nproceeds and whatever savings she had at the time of the accident. She currently spends \nabout $2,000 each month for rent and other basic expenses, and financed her \nundergraduate studies through student loans that included money for living expenses. \nApplicant estimates that she will owe a total of $46,000 for those loans when they are no \nlonger in deferment or forbearance. At a monthly expense rate of $2,000 since November \n2017, Applicant would have spent $96,000 by November 2021. She did not present any \ncurrent financial information and acknowledged that she has not earned income through \nregular employment since 2018. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX D; Tr. 59 \u2013 63, 86 \u2013 89, 93 - \n95)  \nIn her e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any adverse financial information. At the \noutset of the ensuing background investigation, a credit report obtained by investigators \non November 2, 2019, documented the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.x.

A credit report obtained by the government on March 26, 2021, did \nnot reflect any past-due or delinquent debts attributable to Applicant. (GX 1 \u2013 4) \nAs alleged at SOR 1.x, Applicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed for failure to make the \nnecessary payments on the loan she obtained to pay for the car. In her December 4, 2019 \nPSI, Applicant averred that the vehicle was repossessed while she was in the hospital in \nNovember 2012; but she also has claimed her father (who died in December 2018) sold \nthe car and paid off the balance owed. Further, she has claimed she made a $10,000 \ndown payment on the vehicle and was making $1,000 monthly payments, well in excess \nof the payments required by the terms of the loan, reducing the loan balance to about \n$1,000 before she was hospitalized in 2012. However, Applicant\u2019s claims in this regard \nconflict with information showing that in November 2019, the balance was $16,969. \nApplicant has not produced any corroboration for her assertion that she had nearly paid \noff the loan or that any remaining debt had been resolved. This debt does not appear on \nthe most recent available credit report, but there is no indication in the record as to why. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 4; Tr. 47 \u2013 48, 77 \u2013 79, 98 \u2013 101) \nAs alleged in SOR 1.y, Applicant did not file federal or state income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2008 through 2016. Applicant denied the SOR allegation; however, she \nstated in her PSI and at her hearing that she had not filed for those years. A review of \nIRS regulations for individual filing requirements (see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012) suggests that \nbetween 2008 and 2016, the minimum annual income required to trigger a filing obligation \nlikely was less than $7,000. That figure was raised in 2017 to $12,950 to coincide with \nmajor revisions to the U.S. tax code that year. Applicant has acknowledged that she made \nmore than $10,000 in 2012 and should have filed an income tax return for that year. She \nbelieves her father may have filed that return for her while she was receiving medical \ntreatment in late 2012 and early 2013. In support of her claim that she was not required \nto file returns for the years alleged in SOR 1.y, Applicant submitted a self-generated \nstatement regarding her non-filing of returns in 2019 or 2020. With that statement, she \nprovided various unsigned IRS forms pertaining to her receipt of tuition assistance and \nestimated taxes for 2021. None of this information supports her claims about why she did \nnot file her taxes between 2008 and 2016. (Answer; GX 4; AX C; Tr. 48 \u2013 50, 65 \u2013 77, \n101 - 103) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant did not timely file her federal income tax returns for at least nine consecutive \ntax years. Available information also shows she accrued at least 24 delinquent or past-\ndue debts totaling $35,355. This information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nI have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAvailable information does not support any of these mitigating conditions. \nApplicant did not support her claims that she was not required to file federal income tax \nreturns for any of the years alleged in SOR 1.y. Her claim in this regard would be an \nacceptable affirmative defense; however, it was her burden to support that claim. The \ndocuments she provided in response to that allegation did not address her income for \nthose years; nor did they present any reliable information from the IRS about her filing \nstatus. Additionally, her testimony on this issue was not credible. \nAs to her medical debts, Applicant established through her Answer that the debts \nat SOR 1.c and 1.e. Information about the medical debts at SOR 1.g \u2013 1.j shows they \nlikely were resolved using funds from the 2017 accident settlement. As to the car \nrepossession debt at SOR 1.x, Applicant\u2019s response was both convoluted and not \ncredible. She stated in her PSI that she paid down the debt to a $1,000 remaining balance. \nShe also stated that her late father sold the car and paid off the loan for her while she \nwas in the hospital in 2012. Applicant provided no information from the lender or other \nsource that might tend to support her claim. Again, I found her credibility to be lacking on \nthis issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose from circumstances (e.g., illness and car accident) beyond \nher control. Nonetheless, she did not establish that she acted responsibly or promptly in \nthe wake of those circumstances. She has not contacted her creditors or engaged in any \nprofessional financial counseling or assistance, even in the year since the SOR was \nissued. Information about her current finances includes reliance on student loans for \ntuition and living expenses to augment the $60,000 she has likely expended since the \naccident settlement four years ago. The result is a looming $46,000 debt that has been \nin deferment since late 2021. In sum, available information does not instill confidence that \nApplicant will be able to resolve her remaining debts and to achieve the sort of financial \nstability that indicates the level of good judgment required for access to classified \ninformation, and which would serve to avoid similar security concerns in the future. On \nbalance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information remain \nunresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access to \nclassified information. In this regard, I have considered the letters of recommendation \npresented on her behalf. However, in addition to the financial considerations in this case, \nmy doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability stem from her convoluted statements \nduring her PSI and testimony, which, at times, simply was not understandable or credible. \nBecause protection of the interests of national security is the principal focus of these \nadjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for \nclearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.k \u2013 1.y: Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, 1.g \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $28,031 for 13 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.m). Under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted the debts at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.m in response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP (SOR 2.a). In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant admitted with explanations all of the Guideline F allegations. As to the Guideline E allegation, Applicant admitted that he did not answer the Section 26 questions correctly but denied doing so intentionally. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old and has worked as a computer technician for a defense contractor since October 2019. This is his first request for a security clearance. Applicant and his wife have been married since July 2010, and they have one 12-year-old child. 2 Applicant\u2019s wife suffers from medical problems that have prevented her from working outside the home for most of their marriage.

The guidelines \ncited in the SOR were among the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of \nNational Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or \nafter June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on October 25, 2021. Scheduling of this matter for hearing was \ndelayed because Applicant was required to undergo major surgery the first week of \nDecember. After being notified of his successful recovery, I scheduled a hearing to be \nheld on February 17, 2022, via online video teleconferencing. \nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5. Additionally, a copy of a discovery letter dated January 13, 2020, and \na list of the Government\u2019s exhibits are included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 \nand 2, respectively. Applicant testified and produced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 D, which \nwere forwarded by email in advance of the hearing (HX 3). Additionally, I held the record \nopen after hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional information. I received a \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2022. On February 25, 2022, Applicant \nprovided additional information in an email to which were attached three documents \nidentified as AX E \u2013 G. The email forwarding those exhibits is included in the record as \nHX 4. The record closed on March 1, 2022, when I received Department Counsel\u2019s waiver \nof objection to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $28,031 for 13 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.m). Under Guideline E, the Government \nalleged that Applicant deliberately omitted the debts at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.m in response to \nquestions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP (SOR 2.a). In response to the \nSOR (Answer), Applicant admitted with explanations all of the Guideline F allegations. As \nto the Guideline E allegation, Applicant admitted that he did not answer the Section 26 \nquestions correctly but denied doing so intentionally. (Answer) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old and has worked as a computer technician for a defense \ncontractor since October 2019.

(GX 1; Tr. 30) \nStarting in June 2009, Applicant worked for a television production company as a \ntechnician in State A. In January 2013, his employer transferred him to State B, which \nhas a markedly higher cost of living than State A. In August 2015, Applicant was \ntransferred to State C, where he still resides. \nIn October 2016, Applicant was laid off, but he was hired by another company in \nthat industry later the same month. Unfortunately, his new employer started downsizing \nin March 2018 and Applicant again was laid off. Between March and September 2018, \nApplicant worked part-time delivering the U.S. mail in a rural area. He also found part-\ntime work delivering pizza and with Uber and Lyft. In October 2018, Applicant was hired \nto work full time at a truck stop, where he worked until he was hired by his current \nemployer. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 35 \u2013 36, 64 \u2013 70) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are documented through the credit reports produced \nby the Government. They also were discussed during Applicant\u2019s personal subject \ninterview (PSI) with a government investigator on December 17, 2019, and Applicant has \nadmitted the Guideline F SOR allegations. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began around \n2014 after he started taking ill-advised payday loans to make ends meet, as well as to \npay for expenses related to the funeral for his wife\u2019s grandfather, while he was working in \nState B. He regrets taking those loans because their high interest rates, combined with \nthe high cost of rent, gasoline, and other necessities in State B made it difficult for him to \nmake the required loan payments and he eventually defaulted. The resulting \ndelinquencies, alleged at SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, remain unresolved. Because of the \npredatory nature of those loans, Applicant thinks some relief may be available to him as \na result of civil litigation and corrective legislation in State B; however, he has not yet \nresearched those possible solutions. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; Tr. 29 \u2013 32, 47 \u2013 48) \nSince being hired for his current job, Applicant has acted to pay or otherwise \nresolve his debts as his resources allow. The medical debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \n1.e, and 1.m stemmed from treatment of his wife\u2019s conditions. Those debts have been \npaid. Available information further shows that the SOR 1.m debt is a consolidation of his \nother medical debts. In September 2020, Applicant resolved through settlement the \ndelinquent auto loan alleged at SOR 1.g. (Answer; AX A; AX C; AX H; Tr. 12, 30 \u2013 31, 39 \n\u2013 43) \nApplicant disputes the delinquent cellphone account alleged at SOR 1.f. He avers \nthat after he was laid off in 2018, he called the carrier to cancel his service and found a \nmuch cheaper cellphone plan. Applicant believed he only owed the first carrier about \n$300, an amount close to his regular monthly payments. He then began receiving bills for \nthree and four times that amount, which he has been unable to pay, and the SOR 1.f \ncreditor would not take his payment of what he thought he owed.

(Answer; Tr. 43 \u2013 \n45, 48 \u2013 49, 73 \u2013 75) \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.h is for a utility bill that went unpaid when he moved \nfrom State B to State C. He has not yet addressed this debt. The debt at SOR 1.a is for \nunpaid rent for a residence in State C that he occupied between August 2016 and \nNovember 2018. After Applicant was laid off a second time and was working multiple part-\ntime jobs, he thought he had an agreement with the landlord that he could stay in the \nproperty and would pay what he could toward the $1,200 monthly rent required by his \nlease. However, the lease was managed by a property management company that \nevicted Applicant and obtained a civil judgment for $9,754. Applicant disagrees that he \nowes that much in unpaid rent, arguing that he only owes between $3,500 and $4,000. \nNonetheless, he has not been able to resolve this debt. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 35 \u2013 \n39, 46 \u2013 47, 72) \nApplicant earns enough from his current job to meet all of his monthly obligations. \nMost of his spare income is consumed by ongoing medical expenses for him and his wife. \nTheir medical insurance was obtained through Affordable Care Act, and their child is \ncovered under Medicaid. Applicant recently incurred additional medical expenses \nbecause of major cardiovascular surgery and recovery therefrom. He is negotiating a \nconsolidation of bills for uncovered copayments and services in order to stay current on \nhis medical bills. Applicant and his wife manage their finances through a worksheet and \nlive well within their means, albeit with a marginal net monthly cash flow. (Tr. 54 \u2013 64, 70 \n\u2013 71) \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in 2019, he did not declare any of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. He denies that he omitted that information with any intent to deceive \nor mislead the government about his financial problems. During his PSI, Applicant \nvolunteered that he had been evicted in 2018 and that he had experienced financial \nproblems as a result of his two layoffs after living in State B. When the interviewing \ninvestigator presented Applicant with credit report information that documented his other \ndebts, Applicant acknowledged most of the debts. He explained that he did not disclose \nthat information in his e-QIP because he did not think that debts that were \u201ccharged off\u201d \nas business losses had to be listed. He also was confused about whether debts more \nthan seven years old had to be listed. His testimony about this issue was consistent with \nwhat he told the investigator. All available information probative of his intent at the time \nhe completed the e-QIP shows that he did not intend to provide false or misleading \ninformation about his finances. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 50 \u2013 52) \nApplicant presented character references from his truck stop employment and from \ncurrent associates. Additionally, his recent performance evaluations show him to be a \nsolid, reliable employee.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \n5 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent debt that, as of the date of the \nSOR, was still outstanding. This information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to \nrecur and do not reflect poorly on his trustworthiness and good judgment, AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply because his financial problems are recent and multiple. As to AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are rooted in circumstances beyond his control; namely, \nthe high cost of living in State B that left predatory payday loans as his only means of \nmeeting basic expenses, and his subsequent loss of income in 2018. Since 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s income has been greatly reduced, yet he has managed to pay his medical \ndebts and settle a delinquent car loan. He manages his finances in a prudent manner and \nhas not incurred any new delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, and, to the extent he paid \nsome of his debts as soon as he was able, AG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable here. \nI also have considered the potential application of AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the amounts of the debts at SOR 1.a and 1.f. Despite his lack \nof supporting documentation, I found his testimony about those allegations to be both \nplausible and credible. \nThe fact that Applicant still has outstanding delinquent debts reasonably poses a \nsecurity concern. However, assessment of the security significance of a person\u2019s financial \nproblems does not end there. These cases turn as much on an assessment of judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability as on the presence of unpaid debts. Applicant did not incur \nhis debts through irresponsible spending or improper conduct. He readily admits that he \nerred when he obtained the payday loans; however, under the circumstances they \nseemed like a viable financial option at the time. Since starting his current job, Applicant \nhas paid what he could and he has avoided additional unpaid debts. Despite the presence \nof his remaining debts, it is unlikely Applicant would act improperly to obtain funds to \nresolve his financial problems. On balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate \nthe security concerns under this guideline. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern under Guideline E is stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe single SOR allegation under this guideline posits that Applicant intentionally \nmade a false statement about his financial problems by failing to list his past-due or \ndelinquent debts as required by Section 26 of his e-QIP. Because Applicant denied that \nallegation, the burden remained on the Government to provide sufficient reliable \ninformation showing that Applicant made a false statement and intended to do so. (See \nDirective, E3.1.14) Had such information been produced, it would require application of \nthe disqualifying condition at AG 16 \u00b6(a): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant does not deny that he omitted the information at issue; however, all of \nthe information probative of his intent at the time he completed and submitted his e-QIP \nshows that his inaccurate responses were the inadvertent product of mistake or \nmisunderstanding. Further, the Government did not present information in support of SOR \n2.a that established the controverted fact that resulted from Applicant\u2019s denial of that \nallegation. SOR 2.a is resolved for Applicant. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant presented information about his character and reliability that \nfurther supports a fair and commonsense conclusion in favor of granting his request for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 m: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally\nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations\nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden\nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for\nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n \n \n \n(internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c). Further discussion of the disqualifying conditions and \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant described circumstances beyond his control, which adversely affected \nhis finances. He and his spouse had periods of unemployment and underemployment.  \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if [an applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, \ndue to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still \nconsider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nA component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant did not provide supporting \ndocumentary evidence that he initiated or maintained contact with several of his creditors \nover the last five years. He maintained contact with several of his other creditors.   \nThe SOR does not allege: (1) Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturn for TY 2020; (2) he owes several thousand dollars to the IRS; (3) he failed to \nconsistently comply with IRS installment agreements; (4) he failed to disclose on his \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 2, 2019 SCA that his mortgage and his homeowner\u2019s association debts were \nover 120 days delinquent in the last seven years; and (5) he failed to disclose on his \nDecember 2, 2019 SCA that he owed federal income taxes for TY 2019. In ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances \nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); IS\n \nCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nThe financial allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l are \nmitigated. He either paid, disputed, or the creditor was unable to locate these debts, and \nthey no longer appear on his credit reports as delinquent. \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant made payments on August 26, 2022, and October 7, \n2022, which totaled $300, and reduced the debt to $8,871. For SOR \u00b6 1.f, on August 26, \n2022, and October 13, 2022, he paid a total of $340 and reduced the debt to $1,700. For \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, he made payments on August 26, 2022, and October 7, 2022, which totaled \n$300, and reduced the balance owed to $5,117. His documented progress in the last \nthree years on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i occurred in August and October 2022 \nafter he responded to the SOR. \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i. He \ndid not provide documentary evidence of payments in 2020 and 2021 despite promises \non his SCA to initiate payments in 2020. He only made two payments on each debt in \n2022. According to his IRS tax transcripts, he and his spouse received adjusted gross \nincome exceeding $140,000 in TYs 2018, 2019, and 2021.

He did not establish a track record of consistent payments on these three \ndebts, and there is insufficient assurance that these three debts are being resolved. Under \nall the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old systems engineer employed by a large DOD contractor \nfrom February 2018 to the present. He has worked as a systems engineer for 20 years. \nIn 1997, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. His character evidence indicates he is a \ndiligent, dedicated, reliable, responsible, and trustworthy employee. He is conscientious \nabout safeguarding security. He received several awards from his employer from 2019 to \n2022. The character evidence supports his access to classified information. \nApplicant did not provide a good enough reason for his delay in failing to pay or \nestablish a consistent track record of payments for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i \nespecially in light of his and his spouse\u2019s current income and the receipt of at least \n$100,000 when he refinanced his house. He failed to provide a good explanation for why \nhe did not use more of these funds to address these three delinquent SOR delinquent \ndebts. He has not filed a tax return for TY 2020. He owes several thousand dollars to the \nIRS, and he has not consistently made payments under his IRS installment plan. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely paying his debts, he \nmay well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance \nworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On the January 2022 CBR, the balance on \nthis debt reflects recent payments and has been reduced to $461. Applicant opened the \ncredit-card account to purchase a computer for school, but then placed other expenses \non the credit card for which he did not have the money to pay as he was a student. \n(Items 1, 4, 5-9) \nThe student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.o totaling $52,281 have not \nbeen resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not know these debts were delinquent and \nthat his grandmother was supposed to be paying them. He averred that he would \ncontact the creditors and make payment arrangements to bring the accounts current. \nHowever, he did not provide any documentation establishing the debts were paid or \notherwise resolved. The student loans are listed in the August 2020 and January 2022 \nCBRs, which reflect a date of first delinquency of December 2018 and do not reflect any \npayments after December 2019.

(Items 1, 4, 6-9) \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about his \nfinances is not available. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that included a car note debt, \ncredit-card debt, a medical debt, and a substantial amount of defaulted student loans. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions and shifts the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to having insufficient funds to pay his \ndebts because he was in school. He asserted that there was a mix-up with his \npayments on his car note being sent to the wrong mailbox. He alleged that his student \nloans were delinquent because he thought his grandmother was paying them, but she \nwas not. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the cause of his \ndelinquencies on any of his SOR debts was beyond his control. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the car note alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has \nbeen paid. There is also documentary evidence that Applicant has significantly paid \ndown the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are concluded for \nApplicant. \nApplicant alleged that he did not recognize the medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nbut he would research the debt and pay it if he is responsible for it. However, he \nprovided no evidence to indicate a meaningful resolution of this debt through a dispute \nor otherwise. \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution\nof the remaining SOR debts. Applicant stated that he intends to pay the remaining SOR \ndebts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant provided no documents in his response \nto the SOR or in response to the FORM. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). While Applicant\u2019s federal student loans have \ncontinuously been in deferment as of late March 2020, he was delinquent on those \naccounts at least a year prior to this deferment. \n \nApplicant has paid one of his debts and has made payments on another. \nHowever, as he has a substantial amount of unresolved outstanding debt remaining, \nthere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nbe resolved within a reasonable period. While he claimed to have been unable to pay \nhis debts because he was a student, he has been employed for over four years. I am \nunable to find that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control, that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. To the extent that he disputed the \nlegitimacy of one of his past-due debts, he has neither provided documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute nor has he provided evidence of his efforts to \nresolve the issue. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She \narranged a settlement agreement with the creditor to pay $20 a month, but only made \none payment last year, and did not follow through with the agreement. The debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 45-47; GE 3, 4. 5) \nThe collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($18,157) is for a car loan for a vehicle \npurchased in 2018. Applicant testified that she got behind a few times in her monthly \npayments, but she is still paying on the account and has possession of the car. The \nmonthly payment is $466. Her January 2022 credit report reflects that the account is past \ndue $9,710, and the current balance is $15,618, which reflects that she has made \npayments, but they were insufficient to cover the past-due amount. She provided a \ndocument from the creditor indicating she had made a payment arrangement on February \n20, 2022, to pay $500. She did not provide evidence that this payment was made or the \narrangement was to make monthly payments. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 48-51; GE 3, \n4, 5; AE C). \nThe charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($12,834) is a vehicle repossession from \n2015. Applicant testified that she received an IRS Cancelation of Debt Form 1099C. She \nprovided a copy of the 2019 form reflecting the amount alleged as discharged. She \ntestified that she filed the form with her income tax returns. This debt was not resolved. \n(Tr. 51-53; GE 3, 4, 5; AE D) \nThe charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($269) was for a personal loan Applicant \nobtained in 2012 or 2013 to improve her credit score. She testified that she made sporadic \npayments, and a year ago she contacted the creditor wanting to pay the debt. She testified \nher last payment was sometime last year. She does not have a monthly payment \narrangement, but rather will make payments when she can until it is resolved. She \nprovided a copy of her account statement from October 2021 to December 2021 that \nreflects a balance owed of $219. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 53-57; AE F) \nThe charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($554) is a store charge card. Applicant testified \nthat she made payment arrangements to settle the account for $332. She agreed to make \nsix payments of $55, but only made one payment last year and no other payments since. \nThe debt is unresolved. (Tr. 57-58; GE 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant testified that the delinquent medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($364) \nwas for medical equipment that was returned. She provided a document from the creditor \nshowing her account has a zero balance. The debt is resolved.

(Tr. \n59-62; GE 3, 4, 5) \nThe collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($716) is for a credit card. In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer, she said she was going to validate the debt with the creditor and if it was \nconfirmed then she would make payment arrangements. She testified that she contacted \nthe creditor, but did not make payment arrangements. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 62-63; \nGE 3, 4, 5) \nThe SOR alleges delinquent student loans in \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($1,251), 1.k ($3,945) and 1.l \n($20,454). Applicant did not disclose these debts on her 2019 SCA. She stated in her \nSOR answer that she \u201cwas able to get account out of default. Was set up for a repayment \nprogram which included paperwork and documents and place[d] on a payment plan.\u201d \n(Answer to SOR) Her loans are in deferment due to the CARES Act, which provided a \nmoratorium on student loan payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 63-72; GE 3, \n4) \nApplicant testified that she thought she had consolidated her student loans in 2009 \nor 2010. She also has other student loans. Her January 2022 credit report reflects student \nloan accounts totaling approximately $77,917 opened from 2004 to 2008. They too are \ndeferred. It is unknown if some of her student loans have been consolidated. She testified \nshe contacted the creditor in the past and thought that her student loans were in \nforbearance. She was attending college sporadically, but not since 2014. She confirmed \nshe made no payments towards her student loans from 2014 to 2020, when they were \ndeferred due to the pandemic. Applicant\u2019s September 2019 credit reports lists the student \nloans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l as delinquent. (Tr. 63-72; GE 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant provided a document from a collection company servicing the student \nloans alleged in the SOR. Due to the way Applicant copied the document, the date on the \nletter does not appear. The document notes that the total delinquent balance owed to the \nSOR creditor is $27,069 and that Applicant had indicated a wish to rehabilitate the \ndefaulted student loans. She was offered a repayment amount of $5 a month and was \nrequired to sign the agreement. Applicant did not provide any other documents to show \nshe has completed the paperwork required to participate in a rehabilitation program. \nWhen asked how she intended to resolve her student loan debt once the deferment \nexpired, she said she would work out something she could afford. Applicant provided a \nstatement in a post-hearing email. Regarding the student loans alleged in the SOR, she \nsaid that she made a few payments, but never completed a payment program. She had \nrecently contacted the original creditor and the loans were in default. She spoke with a \nrepresentative who mailed her a form to complete to request approval for a new \nrepayment program. She was waiting for the forms. I note that regardless of her \nconversation with the creditor, the student loans are likely deferred under the CARES Act, \nand are not presently in a default status.

Applicant leased an automobile, and it was repossessed in 2018 when she got \nbehind in payments. The credit report lists the charged-off amount of $5,557. Applicant \ntestified that she was unaware a balance was owed on the vehicle and the creditor has \nnot contacted her and she has not contacted them. Applicant testified that she incurred \nthese debts when she was living on her own with her children and not living with her \nmother. Paying her monthly expenses was difficult. (Tr. 74-86; GE 5) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination, \nin the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not sought any financial counseling. When interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in October 2019, she described her finances as a work in \nprogress. She testified that that is still the case. She testified that she wants to improve \nher credit and can do better. She wants to be in a better place, financially. She does not \nmaintain a budget. (Tr. 82-83, 94-96) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s has numerous delinquent debts that she incurred beginning in 2012 \nthat she is unable to pay. She also has student loans that were in a default status before \nthey were deferred due to the pandemic. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant attributes her financial issues to a period of unemployment, medical \nissues, and being a single mother. She has been aware that her financial issues were a \nsecurity concern and attempted to begin repayment plans, but never followed through. \nSince receiving the SOR, she has accumulated additional delinquent debts. Applicant has \nresolved one delinquent debt through a settlement (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and returned medical \nequipment to resolve another (SOR \u00b6 1.g). She received an IRS Form 1099C that \ncanceled her obligation on a car loan. This action does not constitute a good-faith \npayment. She has a past-due car loan and other unpaid delinquent debts. Her student \nloans were in default before they were deferred under the CARES Act due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and recent. Her more recent delinquent \ndebts demonstrate that future issues are likely to recur. Her failure to take meaningful \naction on resolving the debts creates doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Although Applicant\u2019s unemployment, medical \nissues, and child support were beyond her control, she failed to provide sufficient \nevidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. She began repayment \nprograms, but defaulted on them shortly after they began. She accumulated additional \ndelinquent debts after receiving the SOR. She has not had financial counseling. The \nevidence is insufficient that she has made good-faith efforts to resolve her debts. \nApplicant does not have a realistic plan for paying her debts or student loans when they \ncome out of deferment. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that are unresolved. She failed to follow \nthrough on repayment plans. She has student loans that were in default and are now \ndeferred, but does not have a realistic plan for resolving them when the moratorium is \nover. Applicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was awarded an honorable discharge. (Transcript (Tr.) 23-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1.) In November 2007, while he was in the Army National Guard, Applicant was issued an SOR (the 2007 SOR) that alleged various delinquent debts. One of the debts in the 2007 SOR consisted of an account secured by a repossessed vehicle. Applicant claimed that his ex-wife caused his delinquencies on these debts because she was in charge of their finances at the time. Applicant and his ex-spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about 2007, and received a discharge of almost $100,000 of debt in about 2008. (Tr. 36-41; GE 5, 6) The SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately $21,000. These debts consist of a telecommunications debt, a medical debt, and two debts that were secured by repossessed vehicles. The SOR debts appear in Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report, but not in hi",

He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since about September 2013. He has a pending job offer from a \ngovernment contractor contingent on him receiving eligibility for a clearance. He has a \nGED, attended some college courses from 2009 through 2012, and earned a trade \nlicense in 2012. He has been married twice. His first marriage was from 1998 until 2011. \nHe was married again in 2020. He has two adult step-children. He served in the Army \nNational Guard from May 2007 until June 2008, when he was medically discharged. He \nwas awarded an honorable discharge. (Transcript (Tr.) 23-34; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1.) \nIn November 2007, while he was in the Army National Guard, Applicant was \nissued an SOR (the 2007 SOR) that alleged various delinquent debts. One of the debts \nin the 2007 SOR consisted of an account secured by a repossessed vehicle. Applicant \nclaimed that his ex-wife caused his delinquencies on these debts because she was in \ncharge of their finances at the time. Applicant and his ex-spouse filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in about 2007, and received a discharge of almost $100,000 of debt in about \n2008. (Tr. 36-41; GE 5, 6) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$21,000. These debts consist of a telecommunications debt, a medical debt, and two \ndebts that were secured by repossessed vehicles. The SOR debts appear in Applicant\u2019s \n2019 credit report, but not in his 2020 and 2022 credit reports. Applicant attributed the \nfinancial delinquencies contained in the SOR to a lack of income caused, in part, by an \nemployment opportunity that did not pan out. More specifically, in about June 2013, he \nquit his job performing aircraft maintenance in State A and moved across the country to \nState B for a similar job that he thought he had been offered and accepted. However, \nafter moving to State B and informing his new employer that he was ready to start work, \nhis new employer informed him they had hired someone else and the opening was no \nlonger available. Applicant decided to stay in State B, found a lower paying job not in his \nfield, and looked for another job in aircraft maintenance. He found an aircraft \nmaintenance position in State B with his current employer in about September 2013. \n(Tr. 27-29, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6; AE I) \nThe $173 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been resolved. \nApplicant testified that he settled this debt and presented a document dated November \n13, 2020, from the creditor\u2019s collection agency evidencing that the debt had been settled \nfor less than the full amount.

After \ninvestigating this debt when he saw it on his credit report in 2019, Applicant claimed that \na hospital billed him for medical services that were provided to someone else with the \nsame name. He claimed that the charges were related to treatment for a broken hand, \nwhich he has never suffered. He claimed that he disputed the charge with the hospital \nand the collection agency.

(Tr. 63-64; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 6) \nThe $7,379 vehicle loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has not been resolved. Applicant \ntold the background investigator in November 2019 that he would pay this debt once he \naccepted his contingent job offer with a government contractor. At his hearing, he \ntestified he would pay it once he had enough extra funds to afford it. For an unspecified \nperiod of time, he did not pay the loan back because of his \u201carrogance.\u201d Additionally, he \ndid not pay the debt because he thought the vehicle was not properly repaired after \nbeing involved in an accident, because he did not agree with the amount the vehicle \nsold for at auction, and because the debt no longer appeared on his credit report. He \nthought that if a debt no longer appeared on his credit report, he was no longer \nresponsible for it, regardless of why the debt no longer appeared. Based upon the \nconflicting evidence, it is unclear whether he intends to pay it. He presented no \ndocumentary evidence that he has made a payment, disputed this debt, offered or \nnegotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to resolve this debt. \n(Tr. 50-60; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6; AE I) \nThe $11,836 vehicle loan alleged in \u00b6 1.d has not been resolved. This debt \nbecame delinquent when Applicant abandoned his vehicle in State A after moving to \nState B in 2013. He told the background investigator in November 2019 that he would \npay this debt once he accepted his contingent job offer with a government contractor. At \nhis hearing, he testified that he would pay the debt once he had enough extra funds to \nafford it. He claimed that he tried to catch up on the debt after September 2013 when he \nfound another aircraft maintenance position, but the creditor wanted payments that he \ncould not afford. The vehicle that secured the loan was eventually sold at auction. For \nan unspecified period of time, he thought he did not have to pay the loan back because \nof his \u201carrogance.\u201d Additionally, he did not pay the debt because he didn\u2019t agree with the \namount the vehicle sold for at auction, and because the debt no longer appeared on his \ncredit report. Based upon the conflicting evidence, it is unclear whether he intends to \npay it. He presented no documentary evidence that he has made a payment, disputed \nthis debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to \nresolve this debt. (Tr. 27-29, 42-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 6; AE I) \nAs early as November 2019, Applicant earned about $72,000 annually with his \ncurrent employer. In about November 2021, Applicant\u2019s wages at his job increased from \nalmost $30 per hour to almost $42 per hour as a result of joining a union. He works at \nleast 40 hours per week and is paid time and a half for overtime. After this raise, he \nmakes about $85,000 per year. Beginning in about 2011, he began receiving about \n$600 per month in disability compensation from the military. Applicant\u2019s spouse does \nnot work. In about 2019, she was struck by a vehicle and is applying for disability. \nApplicant testified that he has $500 per month left over after accounting for all of his \nexpenses. He holds stock valued at about $35,000 and has between $80,000 and \n$100,00 in a retirement account.

He \nknew he was late in filing this tax return and had not received an extension from the \nIRS. He planned to hire someone to file his 2021 tax return for him. He claimed that he \nis normally on time with filing his tax returns, but this year, because of a move, he has \nnot had time to do so. He claimed that he does not normally owe money to the IRS \nwhen he does file his tax returns.1 (Tr. 30-33, 53-54, 64-67, 74-77; GE 3; AE G, I) \nApplicant provided documents evidencing his favorable resolution of several \nother debts not included on the 2007 SOR or the SOR. He also provided a character \nreference from his former landlord attesting to his compliance with the terms of his \nrental agreement, and her satisfaction with how he treated the property. He also \nprovided a document showing that he completed a U.S. Army training requirement in \n2007. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, B, E, F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts in his 2007 SOR, \nhis bankruptcy, his payments on new accounts, and his late 2021 tax return filing cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation, in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, and for the whole-person analysis. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts evidence his history of financial delinquencies that \nincludes a telecommunications debt and two accounts secured by vehicles. These \naccounts have been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a combination of a lack of \nemployment and underemployment for a couple of months in 2013 and his \u201carrogance\u201d \nin not thinking he owed a delinquent car loan if he didn\u2019t agree with the sale price of the \nvehicle at auction. He also blamed his lack of understanding that he could still be \nresponsible for debts that no longer appeared on his credit report. His lack of \nemployment and underemployment in 2013 was arguably beyond his control. His \narrogance in thinking he need not address delinquent car notes because he did not \nthink the secured property sold for sufficient proceeds at auction was within his control. \nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s lack of understanding of his possible continued responsibility for \ndelinquent debts that no longer appeared on his credit report was within his control. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been \nsettled and paid for an amount less than owed. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant, as \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) and AG \u00b6 20 (d) apply. \nApplicant has provided evidence that he resolved the medical debt in \u00b6 1.b by \ndisputing it with the creditor and the VA because he neither needed nor received the \nmedical services for which this debt was owed. He also provided evidence that \nsomeone else with his name had received these medical services.

SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nconcluded for Applicant as AG \u00b6 20 (e) applies to this debt. \nApplicant\u2019s intentions with respect to the two car note debts are unclear. He has \ngone years without paying or addressing them. He claimed he intended to address them \nonce he had sufficient funds to do so. He has received substantial pay raises and has \naccumulated sufficient financial resources to pay them and has elected not to. Instead, \nhe purchased a $42,000 RV. Regardless, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Moreover, as evidenced by \nApplicant\u2019s large, lump sum payments on other debts, Applicant likely had the funds to \naddress the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, but chose not to. Applicant\u2019s evidence, is \ninsufficient to show he has acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to \nthese debts, or that he has made a good faith effort to repay these creditors or \notherwise resolve these debts. \nDespite not having taken any steps to resolve them, Applicant has relied on the \nfact that, after the 2019 credit report, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d no longer \nappeared on his subsequent credit reports. However, the fact that a debt no longer \nappears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as \nto the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). \nAdditionally, as there is more than one plausible explanation for the absence of debts \nfrom a credit report, such as the removal of debts due to the passage of time, the \nabsence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or \nmitigate a history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform or \nrehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues prior to the SOR and his recent failure to timely file \nhis 2021 IRS tax return also undermine his mitigation efforts because they provide \nevidence of frequency, likelihood of recurrence, and overall financial irresponsibility. \nOverall, I am unable to find that the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control, that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his SOR debts. His financial \nissues are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. The financial considerations security concern is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his positive character reference from his former landlord. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b: \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:    \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Her \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working \nat her present job in January 2018. She is a high school graduate. She was married \nfrom 2010 to 2018, although she was separated from her husband since 2016. She has \na son, age 19, from another relationship. (Tr. 6, 18, 20; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $36,000. The debts \nare comprised of collections and charged-off accounts (credit cards, consumer debts, \nand an auto repossession). The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s security clearance \napplication (SCA), her background interview in June 2019, credit reports from March \n2020, February 2021, and November 2021, and her SOR admissions in her answer. \n(GE 1-5; SOR Answer) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to several things, including being the \nsole income producer when she was married; being separated in 2016, then divorced in \n2018, and not receiving any financial support from her ex-husband; not receiving any \nchild support from her son\u2019s father (she claimed that he owed about $70,000 in past-due \nchild support); being let go from her job in 2017; and having to rely on unemployment \nbenefits and credit cards to make ends meet. Because of these factors, Applicant \nclaimed she was unable to address any of her debts and they all remain delinquent. (Tr. \n19-20, 24, 30-31, 33) \nAppellant admitted that she sold the marital home in 2019 and received proceeds\nof approximately $80,000. She did not address any of her delinquent debts with these \nproceeds, rather she paid her ex-husband $30,000 as part of the divorce settlement and \nused $50,000 to purchase a home for her mother. She also went on vacation with her \nson. She has not sought out any financial counseling. She thought about looking into \nfiling for bankruptcy protection, but she never followed up on doing so. She was given \napproximately two months\u2019 time after her hearing to present evidence that she was \npursuing a loan consolidation plan or bankruptcy protection, but she did not submit any \nsupporting documentation. She has not addressed any of her debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. She has a \nhistory of unpaid debts as established by the evidence and her admissions. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are ongoing and \nare therefore recent. All of her debts are unresolved. She did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. Although her divorces and issues with an ex-husband are circumstances beyond \nher control, she failed to act responsibly in addressing her debts. In particular, she failed \nto use any of the $80,000 in proceeds from the sale of her home in 2019 to pay any of \nher delinquent debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. She failed to seek financial \ncounseling and has not put forth a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service and the circumstances \nsurrounding her indebtedness, including her divorce, her non receipt of child support, \nand her unemployment. However, I also considered that she has made no efforts to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nresolve her debts.

For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Hull, Esq. \n02/02/2022 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant has resolved \nthe delinquent accounts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and filed his outstanding \nincome tax returns. He has rehabilitated his poor financial habits. He has also \ndemonstrated a sufficient period of abstinence from marijuana use and his statement of \nintent to abstain from use in the future is credible. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 4, 2020, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns under \nthe financial considerations and drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines. \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to revoke his security clearance.

Between 2015 and 2018, he admits to incurring \n$5,880 in delinquent debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c) He also admitted to failing to file his \nfederal and state income tax returns in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.d). In 2019, Applicant \nwithdrew funds from his retirement accounts to address his delinquent accounts, except \nfor the charged-off accounts on his credit report. He realized that the charged-off \naccounts remained a concern to the Government when he received the SOR. (Tr. 22, \n25-26, 29, 58, 61-62; GE 2-5) \nApplicant owes the same creditor for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. The creditor agreed to settle both accounts for less than the amounts owed and \nalso agreed to allow Applicant to pay the settlement amount through installment plans. \nAccording to receipts from the creditor, he satisfied the terms of the installment \nagreements in September 2021. (AE E-F, N-Q) Applicant resolved the account alleged \nin SOR \u00b61.c, a personal loan, in January 2021. (Tr. 22-24; 26-30; Answer; AE G) \nApplicant blamed his failure to timely file his 2017 federal and state income tax \nreturns on his concern that he would owe an additional tax liability that he could not \nafford. Although he timely filed for an extension of the filing deadline, he did not file the \nreturns as required. He filed the federal income tax return in April 2020 and did not owe \nany additional taxes. He filed the state income tax return in January 2021 and owed \n$363.00, which he paid upon filing the return. Since 2017, he has timely filed federal \nand state income returns. There is no evidence of any current outstanding federal or \nstate tax liabilities. (Tr. 30-35, 62-63, 72-73; GE 2; AE H-I) \nApplicant has reformed his financial habits. Between April and July of 2019, he \nworked with a credit repair company. He separated from his wife of 12 years in 2015. \nShe left the marital home in 2018. Applicant has primary physical custody and sole \nfinancial responsibility for his two minor children. He does not receive any child support \nfrom his estranged wife. He uses a budget and has established a system that makes it \nmore difficult for him to spend money impulsively. He currently earns approximately \n$87,000 annually and lives within his means. (Tr. 24, 59, 63-66) \nDrug Use \nUnder the substance abuse and misuse guideline, the SOR alleges that \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from November 2004 to November \n2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and that Applicant was terminated from a job in 2018 after he tested \npositive for marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He admits both allegations. (Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant began using marijuana after his discharge from military service in 2004. \nInitially, he used the drug recreationally with his friends. Between 2004 and 2010, he \nused the drug approximately six times per year. He decreased his use of marijuana in \n2010 after learning that he and his wife were expecting their first child. In 2012, he \nbegan working with a company that had a zero tolerance drug policy.

He would use the drug \nduring periods when he was away from work, using no later than 72 hours before he \nwas scheduled to return to work. He believed that by employing this strategy, he would \nnot report for work under the influence of the drug; however, he was aware that he \nwould test positive for the substance. Between 2010 and 2018, Applicant used \nmarijuana three to four times per year. (Tr. 35, 47, 50-53, 56, 68) \nApplicant began to use marijuana to self-medicate difficult emotions between \n2015 and 2018, when he and his wife separated but continued to cohabitate. In 2016, \nhe was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. As a result, he attended six \nweeks of court-ordered counseling. On his own, he continued individual counseling for \nanother year until November 2018. (Tr. 48, 53-55, 70-71) \nIn November 2018, a random urinalysis showed Applicant tested positive for \nmarijuana use. He was terminated from his job. As part of his termination package, his \nemployer provided him with the steps he needed to take to prevent losing his FAA \nlicense. He completed a marijuana awareness course in December 2018 and his \nlicense remains in good standing. (Tr. 36, 38, 40, 66-69, 71, 73) \nApplicant has not used marijuana since November 2018. He vows never to use \nthe drug again and has signed a statement of intent to that effect. In June 2021, \nApplicant submitted to a psychological screening by a licensed psychologist. After \ninterviewing Applicant and administering a series of tests, the psychologist concluded \nthat Applicant does not have a current substance abuse problem. (Tr. 37 -38, 40) \nIn terms of his ability to handle and protect classified information, the \npsychologist opined: \nIn general, he follows rules and law, but has had a few lapses of judgment \nin the past, relatively minor instances of problematic behaviors. This is not \nindicative of a pattern of behavior, as there are no signs of an underlying \nanti-authority attitude or an attempt to subvert rules. He has had a \nlackadaisical attitude towards rules in the past, but has learned to be more \nconscientious and is at low risk to repeat these mistakes. . . . \n[Applicant] does not have any emotional, mental, or behavioral (alcohol \nuse) problem at this time that would impair his judgment or behavior. His \nprevious alcohol and marijuana use did not affect his work or \nrelationships. In the context of his entire life, these were circumscribed, \nisolated incidents. He has learned from these experiences, and is honest, \ncompletes with the rules, has good judgment, and as a good ability to \ncontrol impulses and protect classified information.  (AE J) \nApplicant is performing well at his current job, his performance meeting the \nexpectations of his employers. Applicant testified remorsefully about his history of \nmarijuana use and acknowledges that it is incompatible with his current responsibilities \nand lifestyle. He also acknowledges that any future marijuana use would not only mean \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe inability to obtain or maintain a security clearance in the future, but that future \nmarijuana use would cause the loss of his professional license, making him \nunemployable in his field.

He has \ndeveloped better coping strategies for stress and difficult emotions. (Tr. 37, 39-40, 42-\n45, 49, 67, 75-79; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the financial considerations and the \ndrug involvement and substance abuse guidelines. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the \nalleged conduct as well as the documents in the record support the Government\u2019s prima \nfacie case under both guidelines. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant admits to living beyond his means in the \npast and using credit irresponsibly, which led him to incur delinquent debt as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, totaling $5,880. He also admits his failure to time file his 2017 \nfederal and state income tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.e). The record supports the \napplication of the following financial considerations disqualifying: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore the issuance of the SOR, Applicant took steps to address his financial \nproblems. In 2019, he withdrew money from his retirement accounts to address \ndelinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR. He also engaged a credit repair service to \nhelp him rehabilitate his credit history. He has resolved all of the alleged delinquent \naccounts, filed his outstanding 2017 federal and state income tax returns, and he has \npaid his past-due taxes. \nThe concern in this case is not based on the amount of the alleged outstanding \ndebt, approximately $5,880. The concern lies in the habits and practices that caused \nApplicant to accumulate delinquent debt and how they may impact his ability to handle \nand protect classified information. Applicant has acknowledged his irresponsible habits \nand has taken steps to rehabilitate himself. However, he now serves as the only means \nof financial support for his two children, a situation that Applicant takes seriously. Given \nthis change in financial responsibility, it is unlikely that Applicant will engage in the \nfinancial habits of the past. The financial considerations concerns are mitigated. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances \u2026 can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impartment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleges that \nApplicant and he admits that he used marijuana, with varying frequency between \nNovember 2004 and November 2018, and that he was terminated from employment in \nNovember 2018 after testing positive for marijuana on a random urinalysis test. Based \non the record, the following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nApplicant presented sufficient information to merit the application of the following \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this \nproblems, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n(1) Dissociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand, \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds from revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant spoke candidly about his history of marijuana use and the negative \nimpact it had on his life. He has abstained from illegal drug use since November 2018 \nand has provided a signed statement of intent to abstain in the future. Although he has \nfriends who continue to use the drug, he has established a bright-line boundary about \nnot using in his presence. In addition to the loss of employment in 2018, Applicant \nunderstands the consequences of any future drug use. Given his circumstances, it is \nunlikely that Applicant will use marijuana in the future. This conclusion is also supported \nby the finding of a June 2021 psychological assessment, which noted, in pertinent part, \nthat Applicant does not have a substance use disorder, that he learned from his past \nexperiences, and that he is fit to handle and safeguard classified information. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding about Applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). He has sufficiently demonstrated that he has \nrehabilitated and reformed the behaviors that gave rise to the concerns alleged in the \nSOR. Although marijuana use violates federal law, there is no indication that Applicant \nhas an underlying problem with rules or authority. As a result of the negative \nconsequences of any future illegal drug use and poor financial habits, Applicant is \nunlikely to engage in similar behavior in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nWithdrawn \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On April 30, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \neffective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on May 26, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

The \ncase was heard as scheduled on December 3, 2021. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 8, 2021. \nAt the hearing the Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted without objection. In the absence of any objection, I agreed to take \nadministrative notice of a fifth document (GE 5) presented by Department Counsel, which \nwas a state statute that is relevant to one of the SOR allegations. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through S, which were also \nadmitted without objection. I asked the counsel for both parties to submit briefs on a legal \nissue raised by Applicant\u2019s counsel. Applicant\u2019s brief was submitted on December 15, \n2021, Department Counsel\u2019s submitted the Government\u2019s reply brief on December 20, \n2021.

At the time of that marriage, Applicant\u2019s first \nwife had two minor children, a girl and a boy, from a prior marriage or relationship. \nApplicant\u2019s former stepdaughter (Stepdaughter 1) was born in about 1977 and his former \nstepson was born in about 1976. Her mother legally changed Stepdaughter 1\u2019s last name \nto Applicant\u2019s last name, though he never formally adopted her. In about 1993, Applicant \nmoved out of the marital home. He and his first wife divorced in about 1995 or 1996. (Tr. \nat 21, 32-33, 36, 38, 40, 56-57, 59, 61-62.) \nIn about 1996 Applicant married his second wife. She also had two children, a boy \nand a girl, who were teenagers at the time of the marriage. Applicant and his second wife \ndivorced in about 2006. (Tr. at 59.) \nIn January 1993, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). In December 1993, he pleaded guilty to the charge, a misdemeanor, and was \nsentenced to five years of probation, to end in December 1998. This offense is not alleged \nin the SOR. (GE 4 at 4.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nUnder Guideline D, the Government alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.a (and cross-alleges in \nSOR \u00b6 2.b, discussed below) that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he was \narrested in 1995 and charged with Lewd or Lascivious Acts with a Child under 14. \nFollowing a plea, he was sentenced to one year in jail, which was \u201cstayed,\u201d placed on \nprobation for three years, and ordered to register as a sex offender. Applicant denied \nthese allegations in his Answer, stating that the allegation was inaccurate. \nIn 1995 the daughter of Applicant\u2019s first wife (the Stepdaughter 1) accused him of \nsexually molesting her over a period of several years. Applicant testified that he believed \nshe was about 13 years old at the time of the first allegation of abuse. According to an \nofficial state document in the record, Stepdaughter 1 reported the abuse began in 1988. \nShe would have been about 11 years old at that time. She was about 18 when she filed \ncriminal charges against Applicant. He was arrested on April 4, 1995, and charged with \nnine felony counts of Lewd and Lascivious Acts involving Children under the state penal \ncode. Applicant claims he has no recollection of \u201cthe details\u201d any of the events of which \nhe was accused over a multi-year period starting in 1988, though he does not deny \n\u201csomething may have happened.\u201d He testified that his lack of any memory of these events \nwas due to his excessive alcohol drinking habits during that period. (Tr. at 28-36, 39-40, \n42, 55; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1.) \nAccording to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant pled guilty to committing lewd and lascivious \nact(s) with a minor, and he was sentenced to one year in jail (stayed), placed on three \nyears of probation, and required to register as a sex offender.

At another point, \nApplicant explained that he pled no contest to one charge because he had no recollection \nof the sexual abuse that he was accused of committing. (Tr. at 11, 19-27, 29, 45-50, 93; \nGE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 1.) In his post-hearing brief, his lawyer acknowledged that Applicant \npled to one of the charges \u201cto avoid more punishment if he was found guilty at trial.\u201d \n(Applicant\u2019s Brief at 1.) \nAs part of his probation sentence, the court ordered Applicant to participate in three \nyears of group therapy. Applicant testified that he extended the therapy an extra two years \nvoluntarily because he was \u201chelping others.\u201d He claimed that as part of his therapy, he \nvoluntarily was tested to determine if he was a pedophile and the test results were \nnegative. He also voluntarily attended Alcoholics Anonymous and Sex Addicts \nAnonymous meetings. (Tr. at 11, 19-27, 29, 45-50, 93.) \nApplicant noted further in his e-QIP that the \u201cCharges [were] Expunged\u201d in about \nOctober 1995. At the hearing he provided a July 18, 2008 court document that stated: \n\u201cCase dismissed and conviction expunged\u201d pursuant to a state statute that permits a court \nto take such action following the successful completion of probation. An accompanying \ncourt order provided further that there were significant exceptions to the order of \nexpungement, including a requirement that the original conviction be disclosed in \nresponse to questions in state questionnaires or applications and that \u201cthe conviction in \nthis case remains a part of the court file which can be viewed by the public.\u201d (GE 1 at 33-\n34; AE Q at 1-2.) \nApplicant also provided an October 26, 2021 letter from his state\u2019s sex offender \nregistry office, in response to Applicant\u2019s request for a review of his registration \nrequirements The State registry office indicated that it had changed his status to a \u201cTier \n2-Adult,\u201d which meant that he is eligible to petition for the termination of his registration \nrequirement under certain conditions. As of the close of the record in this case, however, \nApplicant remains a registered sex offender, as evidenced by his Proof of Current \nRegistration, also dated October 26, 2021. (AE S at 1, 3.) \nApplicant testified that his therapist from his post-conviction time period \nemphasized that he should focus on moving forward and learning from his mistakes. \nApplicant provided no further information about his discussions with his therapist \nregarding what his past mistakes were and what he was supposed to learn from them. \nThis is significant because Applicant claims that he recalls nothing about any incident of \nsexually abusing Stepdaughter 1, including the incident to which he pled nolo contendere. \nHe testified: \u201cI try not to remember that.\u201d (Tr. at 24-26.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nIn this paragraph the Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. \nSpecifically, the SOR alleges that Applicant provided false information be failing to \ndisclose his daughter and two current stepdaughters in his e-QIP. Applicant denied the \nallegation(s) under this paragraph in his Answer, stating that the omissions were not \ndeliberate. The SOR also cross-alleges under Guideline E the allegation under Guideline \nD regarding the 1995 criminal charges of Lewd and Lascivious Acts with Children, his \nplea, and his sentence. He did not respond separately to this allegation in his Answer. \nApplicant did not list his daughter or his two stepchildren on his e-QIP. He initially \nexplained in his background interview that he failed to list them due to oversight. At the \nhearing, he admitted that he omitted his daughter and two stepchildren because he did \nnot want them to become involved in his background investigation. I note that he also did \nnot list either his first or second wife in response to the relevant question in Section 17 of \nhis e-QIP. His first wife was the mother of Stepdaughter 1, who accused Applicant of \nmolesting her. He answered negatively to the question of whether he had one or more \nformer spouses. (GE 1 at 20-26; GE 2 at 4.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained the omissions of family members and former \nspouses in his e-QIP was due to fact he did not want his daughter or his current \nstepchildren to be interviewed in connection with his security clearance investigation. He \nwas particularly concerned about his daughter being contacted by Government \ninvestigators. (Tr. at 28-36, 39-40, 42, 55.) \nIn his background interview, Applicant advised the investigator about his daughter \nand two stepdaughters, as well as his two prior wives. He told the investigator that he \nwould provide their names and information at a later date. He subsequently called the \ninvestigator and declined to provide the information. He said that he was afraid that the \nindividuals would be contacted and interviewed regarding his criminal record. He also \nsaid he was concerned that his employer would find out about his history and that would \nput his employment in jeopardy. The next day he provided the information about his \ndaughter and two stepdaughters to the investigator. He repeated that his child and \nstepchildren were not listed in his e-QIP due to oversight. (GE 2 at 4, 8-10.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant was questioned about his statements about these family \nmembers during his background interview. He testified: \nThe oversight was made because I was trying to protect my natural \ndaughter, and to be honest, I didn\u2019t think I would get the \u2013 I was trying to \ndelay the process of the application.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. at 63.) He was also questioned whether his daughter was aware of the accusations \nagainst him, the court proceedings, and his status as a registered sex offender. His \nresponse was: \u201cNot in detail.\u201d His two current stepchildren know a limited amount about \nhis criminal history. He testified: \u201cBeyond that, I try to keep it in the past and not bring it \nup.\u201d (Tr. at 63-65, 76-80.) \nIn his 2019 e-QIP, Applicant also disclosed limited information about his 1995 \narrest and charges. In response to a question in Section 22 regarding Police Record \nasking for \u201ca description of the specific nature of the offense,\u201d Applicant wrote \u201cPC 290 \noffense.\u201d This reference is to the state sex registration statute, not the criminal statute he \nwas charged with violating, i.e., Penal Code Section 288(a). At the hearing, Applicant \nsaid: \u201cI figured that [response] would suffice.\u201d He denied that he was trying to hide the \ntrue nature of his felony offense from his security manager or employer by not giving more \nspecific information as required by the question. He thought it was best not to elaborate \non his criminal record. As far as Applicant knows, no one at his employer is aware of his \ncriminal record. (Tr. at 66-67, 78-79; GE 1 at 33-34.) \nIn addition, in detailing his 1993 DUI offense on his 2019 e-QIP, Applicant failed to \ndisclose the dates of his probation as required by a specific question in Section 22 of the \ne-QIP. (GE 1 at 33; GE 2 at 5, 7; GE 4 at 4.) These omissions are not alleged in the SOR \nso I cannot consider them as disqualifying conduct. (The DUI itself was also not alleged.) \nBut I considered them in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person concept. \nMitigation \nApplicant testified that he makes an effort to stay away from children when he can. \nFor instance, he and his wife do not babysit any grandchildren. He has made this choice \nto be conservative and to avoid the possibility of any accusations against him or any \ntroubling perceptions. Under his ongoing status as a registered sex offender, he is not \nallowed to work in schools or other jobs that involve contact with children. (Tr. ??) \nApplicant is not involved in any kind of therapy. He testified that he occasionally \ngoes to church. The focus of his court-ordered therapy in the 1990s was on issues related \nto sexual attraction to children, specifically family sexual abuse. It was not alcohol \naddiction therapy. He drinks alcohol occasionally, but he claims he never drinks to \nexcess. The last time he drank excessively was more than 20 years ago. His focus is on \nmoving forward. (Tr. at 61-63, 68-71, 75-77.) \nIn the years since his Other than Honorable discharge from the Navy, Applicant \nhas educated himself and has had a successful career. He presented his recent \nperformance evaluations, which show that he is well-regarded by his employer. He earns \nabout $170,0000 annually, and receives bonuses every year of $16,000 to $20,000.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for sexual conduct are set out in AG \n\u00b6 12, which reads in pertinent part: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nAG \u00b6 13 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a. The Government, therefore, has the burden of proof \nto establish it. Applicant was charged with Lewd or Lascivious Acts involving Children \nbased on Stepdaughter 1\u2019s allegations. Applicant has raised a question whether there is \nsufficient corroborating evidence that he engaged in the behavior Stepdaughter 1 claims \nand for which he was arrested and charged. He does not deny the behavior, but he also \ndoes not admit it. The existence of the charges alone is evidence that the police and the \nprosecutor had concluded that there was probable cause to charge Applicant with the \ncrime of sexually abusing Stepdaughter 1. Of course, AG \u00b6 13(a) does not even require \nevidence of a prosecution. \nAt the hearing, Applicant \u2018s counsel argued that under the law of the state where \nthe alleged abuse occurred, Applicant\u2019s plea of no contest did not result in a conviction \nand a finding of guilt, notwithstanding the fact that the criminal court pronounced a \nsentence of one-year imprisonment, which was stayed, and a period of probation, as well \nas other requirements. This is relevant because Applicant did not admit any criminal \nconduct when he pled no contest to one of the criminal charges. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nattorney the opportunity to submit post-hearing a brief in support of his legal argument, \nand I gave Department Counsel the opportunity to submit a reply brief.

Applicant relies heavily upon a \n1970 appellate court decision in that state that holds it is legally permissible for a criminal \ndefendant to plead nolo contendere to a criminal charge without admitting the factual \nbasis of the charge to which he is pleading. The decision involved a nolo contendere plea \nto a charge different than the original charge the defendant faced so that he would be \neligible for a lesser punishment. The court also held that it was appropriate for the state \ncourt to accept the plea, find the defendant guilty, and impose a sentence. I note that \nApplicant pled nolo contendere to one of the multiple charges filed against him, not a \ndifferent charge. In any event, the state court properly accepted, pursuant to this authority, \nApplicant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to one of the charges against him, found him guilty of \nthat crime, and sentenced him. \nBoth Applicant\u2019s Counsel and Department Counsel cite to the same state statute \n(the Statute) regarding pleas of nolo contendere. The Statute reads as follows: \u201cupon a \nplea of nolo contendere, the court shall find the defendant guilty. The legal effect of such \na plea, to a crime punishable as a felony, shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty for \nall purposes.\" (Emphasis added.) I note that Applicant\u2019s brief quotes additional language \nin the Statute that imposes limits on the collateral use of a nolo contendere plea. That \nstatutory provision, however, is inapplicable because it explicitly applies only to non-\nfelony cases. Applicant pled nolo contendere to a felony charge. (Applicant\u2019s Brief at 7; \nDepartment Counsel Brief at 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel appears to argue that his client\u2019s plea of nolo contendere \ncannot be used to establish that he committed the underlying criminal conduct. At the \nhearing, he argued further that under the applicable state law, a court can accept a nolo \ncontendere plea and impose a sentence, but does not actually \u201cconvict\u201d the defendant. \nHe does not repeat that argument in his extensive brief. By citing the Statute, Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel is limiting his argument to make a simpler point that Applicant\u2019s plea of nolo \ncontendere plea cannot be used against him. Applicant\u2019s brief no longer argues that he \nwas not convicted of the crime to which he plead nolo contendere. The relevant legal \nissue, therefore, is the significance of the state court finding of Applicant\u2019s guilt and \nconviction for the crime to which he pled nolo contendere. \nIt is important to note that Applicant\u2019s brief cites no DOHA law in support of his \nargument. Under DOHA case law, Applicant\u2019s conviction is indisputable proof that he \ncommitted the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Acts involving Children. ISCR Case No. 15-\n08527 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 2, 2018); ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, \n2006). It does not matter whether the conviction is after a jury trial in which the defendant \nproclaims his innocence, after a guilty plea where the defendant admits his guilt, or after \na plea of nolo contendere where the defendant does not admit or deny his guilt. The \nconviction results in the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which means \nthat Applicant cannot claim that there is no evidence that he committed a crime of sexually \nabusing Stepdaughter 1.

(Department \nCounsel Brief at 2, 5.) \nI find that security concerns under AG \u00b6 13(a) were established by a \npreponderance of the evidence in this record. This is based on the fact that he was \nprosecuted for the offense of committing lewd and lascivious acts with a minor, pled no \ncontest to that felony, and as part of his sentence was required to register as a sex \noffender \u2013 a registration status that is ongoing. \nConcerns under AG \u00b6 13(c) are also established by substantial evidence. Applicant \ntook extreme steps in the preparation of his e-QIP to protect his extended family members \nand employer from becoming involved in the investigation of his eligibility for a security \nclearance, including omitting relevant information about his family, his former wives, \nincluding the mother of Stepdaughter 1, and the specific nature of the felony charges \nagainst him. His past actions and conviction of a felony of this nature is highly \nembarrassing and still renders him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nIn addition, concerns under AG \u00b6 13(d) were raised, because the charges involved \nStepdaughter 1, a member of his own family at that time. Sexual involvement with a minor \nand a family member unquestionably reflects a lack of judgment on Applicant\u2019s part. \nThe evidence establishing these disqualifying conditions shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those security concerns. The guideline includes three conditions in \nAG \u00b6 14 that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged sexual \nbehavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and  \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAlthough the sexual behavior happened many years ago, Applicant\u2019s failure to \nacknowledge his serious sexual misconduct with Stepdaughter 1 when she was a minor \ncasts serious doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and current \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.

In fact, I found much of his testimony on the important facts of \nthis case to lack credibility, based upon his demeanor and his desire to shield his daughter \nand stepdaughters from the details of his past criminal conduct. He testified repeatedly \nthat his former therapist encouraged him to move on from his past mistakes. That advice \ndoes not, however, excuse his lack of candor in acknowledging those mistakes \u2013 \nespecially when his actions constitute severe misconduct and a serious breach of trust \nthat he owed Stepdaughter 1, who carried his last name. \nAs noted, Applicant remains deeply concerned about his daughter learning about \nthe full extent of his past misconduct. He also did not want an investigator to interview \nother family members and those at his place of employment about his felony conviction. \nHe is afraid that his past will come back and damage him. As a result, he remains \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation and duress. Furthermore, it cannot be said that his \npast treatment was successful if he never reached the point of acknowledging his crime \nagainst Stepdaughter 1 and the damage his actions caused her. Significantly, he has not \nprovided a favorable prognosis from a qualified professional that shows that he has truly \nfaced up to and owns his past criminal behavior. The ongoing nature of the risk he poses \ngenerally is also evidenced by the requirement that he register annually as a sex offender. \nHis state does not fully trust him in society. For all these reasons, no Guideline D \nmitigating conditions are established. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nBoth of the above disqualifying conditions have been established. Applicant \ndeliberately omitted his daughter and his current stepchildren, when preparing and \ncertifying the truth of his e-QIP, because he did not want them to be interviewed about \nhis past criminal conduct. His other significant omissions in the e-QIP further evidence \nthe deliberate nature of the falsifications identified in the SOR. He was dishonest in his e-\nQIP and continued to be dishonest at the hearing, all for the purpose of avoiding a close \nexamination of his past actions. \nThe facts alleged under Guideline D also establish the disqualifying conditions set \nforth in AG \u00b6 16(e)(1). It is evident that Applicant is very concerned that various past and \npresent family members, and his employers, will become aware of his conviction and \nongoing sex offender registration to the detriment of his personal, professional, and \ncommunity standing. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contribute to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur. \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant initially \nfailed to provide requested information to the investigator regarding the identity of his \ndaughter and current stepdaughters. He later acknowledged that his omissions were \ndeliberate. He said that he was afraid that the individuals would be contacted and \ninterviewed regarding his criminal record. He also said he was concerned that his \nemployer would find out about his history and that would put his employment in jeopardy. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant ultimately provided the omitted information, but that action was not a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsifications. The omissions were not minor and \nwere recent. It is likely that Applicant will continue to take actions to hide his past conduct \nfrom his employer and family. \nApplicant has not acknowledged his behavior. Applicant presented his counseling \nas not having focused on his past mistakes. Instead, the counselor encouraged him to \nmove forward. The available evidence cannot be viewed as having established successful \nrehabilitation that would make future recurrence unlikely. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his sexual behavior and personal conduct. By not acknowledging his \npast sexual behavior, he has not established successful rehabilitation nor has he \nminimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. His repeated instances of lack \nof candor, both in his e-QIP and at the hearing, raise serious questions about his \ncharacter, trustworthiness, and judgment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubt as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges sexual behavior (Guideline D) under SOR 1.a, 1.b, and the added 1.c. allegation. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a by engaging in conversations of a sexual nature between 2009 and October 2017. He also admitted paying for professional webcam services involving American women and other women of unknown nationalities. Applicant denied SOR 1.b alleging that he engaged in addictive masturbation or illegally viewed pornography for sexual gratification. As to SOR 1.c, Applicant denied the allegation as stated by Department Counsel. See Tr. 20-22. He admitted the updated July 2021 diagnosis of the psychologist which indicated the compulsive sexual behavior disorder was \u201cin remission.\u201d (Tr. 159) The SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B) under SOR 2.a and 2.b. In response to both allegations, Applicant incorporated his responses to SOR 1.a and 1.b. He admitted that under SOR 2.a, while holding a security clearance from 2009 through 2017, he provided approximately $200,000 through an electronic commerce system or webcam websites to citizens and residents of the Philippines or other individuals of unknown nationalities. Except for his use of the webcam model websites, he denied the money he paid for the online activity with the Filipino women was a condition of engaging in any type of sexual activity. He denied he had physical relationships with any of the women at issue. Applicant is 56 years old. He married his wife in 1995 and has two children under 18",

Guideline D has not been mitigated. \nEligibility for security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 2, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) seeking security clearance eligibility required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. After an investigation, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to grant a security clearance. DCSA issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 10, 2020, detailing security concerns \nraised sexual behavior (Guideline D) and foreign influence (Guideline B).

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on July 20, 2021, for a hearing on September 17, 2021. The hearing was held \nas scheduled. The Government\u2019s five exhibits and Applicant\u2019s 12 exhibits (AE A-L) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 11-13) The record in this case closed \nSeptember 27, 2021, when DOHA received the transcript. \nRulings on Procedure \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant moved to amend the SOR by striking \nthe word \u201cextramarital\u201d from subparagraphs 1.a, 2.a, and 2.b (incorporating 1.a by \nreference). (Tr. 14-15) Department Counsel had no objection to striking the word from \nthe three subparagraphs. I granted the motion. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant also moved to strike subparagraph SOR 1.b entirely. In his motion, \nApplicant asserted that \u201caddictive masturbation\u201d is not defined in the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Department Counsel opposed the motion \ncontending that the Government\u2019s case-in-chief would establish the addictive nature of \napplicant\u2019s masturbation. Having read the psychologist\u2019s report, reviewed the testimony \nof the psychologist and Applicant, and carefully examined the September 2019 PSI, I \ndenied the motion to strike SOR 1.b. (Tr. 158) However, regarding the second prong of \nthe allegation \u201cpornography viewing for sexual gratification,\u201d it should be stated that \nthere is no law prohibiting the viewing of pornography for sexual pleasure in the privacy \nof one\u2019s home. \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR 1 by adding SOR 1.c that reads as \nfollows: In March 2021, the Applicant\u2019s psychologist diagnosed him as having a \ncompulsive sexual behavior disorder. (Tr. 20; AE H at 6) Though not recognized by the \nDSM, the condition is identified in Revision Number 11 of the International Classification \nof Diseases (ICD-11), and is viewed as an impulse control disorder. Applicant did not \nobject and the motion as stated by Department Counsel regarding SOR 1.c was \ngranted. (Tr. 20-22) At the end of the hearing, Applicant modified his earlier position \nregarding the SOR 1.c allegation because of the expert\u2019s updated diagnosis (between \nJuly and September 12, 2021) where she noted \u201cAt the current time, his self[-]report \nindicates that his Compulsive Sexual Behavior disorder is in remission.\u201d See AE H at 6. \nDepartment Counsel objected to the modification as not supported by the evidence. (Tr. \n158-159) I interpret Applicant\u2019s remarks as a denial of SOR 1.c. because it does not \ninclude the words \u201cin remission.\u201d The diagnostic impressions of the expert will be \nweighed and balanced against the testimonial and documentary evidence to determine \nwhether the \u201cremission\u201d term is justified. \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also moved to amend the SOR by adding a separate \nparagraph (SOR 3.a) under Guideline E (personal conduct). SOR 3.a reads as follows: \nApplicant\u2019s conduct alleged under SOR paragraphs 1 and 2, also represents poor \njudgment, lack of candor, and rule violations under Guideline E. Applicant objected to \nthe proposed addition of Guideline E because his conduct is specifically covered by the \nGuidelines D and B. I denied the motion as I believe Applicant\u2019s conduct is already \naddressed by Guidelines D and B of the SOR. (Tr. 21-24) \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges sexual behavior (Guideline D) under SOR 1.a, 1.b, and the \nadded 1.c. allegation. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a by engaging in conversations of a \nsexual nature between 2009 and October 2017. He also admitted paying for \nprofessional webcam services involving American women and other women of unknown \nnationalities. Applicant denied SOR 1.b alleging that he engaged in addictive \nmasturbation or illegally viewed pornography for sexual gratification. As to SOR 1.c, \nApplicant denied the allegation as stated by Department Counsel. See Tr. 20-22. He \nadmitted the updated July 2021 diagnosis of the psychologist which indicated the \ncompulsive sexual behavior disorder was \u201cin remission.\u201d (Tr. 159) \nThe SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B) under SOR 2.a and 2.b. In \nresponse to both allegations, Applicant incorporated his responses to SOR 1.a and 1.b. \nHe admitted that under SOR 2.a, while holding a security clearance from 2009 through \n2017, he provided approximately $200,000 through an electronic commerce system or \nwebcam websites to citizens and residents of the Philippines or other individuals of \nunknown nationalities. Except for his use of the webcam model websites, he denied the \nmoney he paid for the online activity with the Filipino women was a condition of \nengaging in any type of sexual activity. He denied he had physical relationships with \nany of the women at issue. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He married his wife in 1995 and has two children \nunder 18 years of age. (GE 1 at 19-20) He identified his au pair as being his only foreign \ncontact in the last seven years. (GE 1 at 26-28) Applicant explained in his vitae (AE A) \nthat since 2004, he has been employed as a government relations manager. Recently, \nhis employer was purchased by another company. He is currently employed as a \ntranslator, working with engineers within his company to improve a government \nagency\u2019s systems and functionality. He has held a security clearance since 2009 \nwithout any security issues.

(Tr. \n13-14) See AE H and I. She has a PhD in clinical psychology and a neuropsychological \ndegree.

Since 2017, she has been clinical assistant professor at a \nlocal university teaching doctoral students and supervising student therapy caseloads \nand seminars. The expert has been in private practice since 1995, conducting therapy \nat every age level, administering psychological testing and making neuropsychological \nassessments. (AE I) The expert believes that she has a very good understanding of the \ntrustworthiness required by an individual who possesses a security clearance. However, \nshe has never been involved in the evaluation of a person\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance. While she had no specific training in compulsive sexual behavior, she has \ndone some research on the condition. (Tr. 28-30, 32, 44) \nBefore consulting with Applicant, the expert reviewed the SOR and Applicant\u2019s \nanswer, his September 2020 answers to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), the affidavit (AE \nG) of Applicant\u2019s wife (the affidavit is dated the same day as the expert\u2019s psychological \nevaluation). The expert\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant is based on her virtual consultation with \nhim on two occasions in March 2021, which included the administering of three \npsychological tests, and a face-to-face July 2021 interview resulting in her written \npsychological evaluation dated September 12, 2021. (AE H) Her initial diagnosis of \nApplicant in March 2021 was compulsive sexual behavior founded on his \u201cpersistent \ninability to control his sexual impulses which resulted in recurring sexual behavior.\u201d (AE \nH at 6) He told the expert that his wife was not happy with his behavior. (Tr.31-34, 48) \nThe expert provided an explanation for the portion of her diagnosis indicating \nApplicant\u2019s condition was \u201cin remission.\u201d She rendered this diagnosis on an unknown \ndate between July 10, 2021 and the September 12, 2021, the date of her report. As the \nexpert explained, individuals with addictive behaviors can often stop the behaviors just \nas alcoholics who have abstained from alcohol use for a period of time. Based on her \nclinical judgment and the honesty that Applicant demonstrated in his answers to her \nquestions, together with the three psychological tests, the expert opined that Applicant\u2019s \ncompulsive disorder was \u201cin remission.\u201d She believed he stopped his behavior when he \ndiscovered in 2017 that it would cause a problem for him professionally. Even if \nApplicant\u2019s condition was still in an active status, she opined that he would safeguard \nnational security information and not be susceptible to blackmail because his wife was \naware of his sexual behavior. Though there is a possibility the behavior could reappear, \nthe expert believed that the behavior was not active presently. (Tr. 33, 35-37, 46) \nThe expert has never seen the terms \u201caddictive masturbation\u201d in the \npsychological literature. Applicant indicated to her that his watching pornography and \nonline sexual interactions \u201cgradually became a habitual activity which he pursued \nseveral times a week.\u201d Applicant approximated to the expert that he interacted with \nabout 200 women between 2009 and 2017. (AE H at 3) The expert is aware of the need \nfor additional research into pornography addiction and compulsive sexual behavior. In \nher view, the frequency of addictive activities is not as important as whether someone is \nhaving trouble controlling it and whether it interferes with personal, professional, and \nfamilial areas of an individual\u2019s life. The expert reiterated that although she believed \nApplicant had stopped the activity when he realized the potential adverse connection to \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis job, and even though the tests she administered indicated Applicant\u2019s honesty about \nthe sexual activity, it was hard for her to predict whether his compulsive sexual behavior \nmight restart in the future. The expert does not believe that Applicant has a condition \nthat could affect his judgment and reliability. (Tr. 36-41)  \nIn her earlier testimony, the expert identified the documents that she reviewed \nbefore her consultations with Applicant. She did not review GE 4, the online payment \nsystems record that Applicant used to pay the Filipinos between 2009 and 2017. She \ndid not review any of Applicant\u2019s medical records. Rather, she relied on Applicant\u2019s \nresponses during their consultations and her clinical judgment. She was not aware of \ntreatment that Applicant had in 1999 for masturbation. She was not sure that Applicant \ntold her about his marriage counseling in 2017 or 2018. She did not meet with \nApplicant\u2019s wife. (Tr. 48-51) \nContinuing with the subject of therapy or counseling, the expert was not \naware that Applicant received any therapy or counseling after she began seeing him in \nMarch 2021. She testified that she and Applicant intended to meet \u201csome additional \ntimes\u201d after their meeting on July 10, 2021, but she caught the Covid-19 virus on July \n26, 2021, and was ill for over six weeks. (Tr. 55) Even though Applicant did not follow \nup on the expert\u2019s recommendation for psychotherapy to address his underlying issues, \nshe declined to withdraw her remission diagnosis because Applicant convinced her that \nhe had stopped the behavior. She again equated Applicant\u2019s remission status to an \nalcoholic who no longer needs treatment to continue abstinence. (Tr. 54-56; AE H at 6) \nApplicant told the expert that the interaction with the Filipinos, which sometimes \nwas only conversation and sometimes conversations with sexual activity, would occur \nfor about two or three hours in the evening in his room after dinner. The expert testified \nthat Applicant told her that his daughter\u2019s discovery of the internet webcam activity in \n2019 prompted him to stop his behavior. (Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant\u2019s September 2019 PSI and testimony \nApplicant testified that none of his pornographic activities involved underage \nindividuals or other activities listed in his September 24, 2019 affidavit to the \nGovernment. None of the activity occurred in the work place on government or work \ncomputers. None of the activity involved physical contact with third parties. Applicant \nnever provided any videos or photos to others. He never supplied his real identity or \nemployment to any of the females he interacted with. (Tr. 63-65, 86,104; GE 3) \nAt some time before 2009, Applicant was online and began viewing a social \nmedia chatroom designed for groups. Early into this activity, he would just listen and not \npost comments. He switched to private conversations where he would send a message \nto a person that no one else could view. Interacting individually was exciting for \nApplicant because he could actually see and talk to someone located far away.

(Tr. 98-99) (This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. It will be \naddressed in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall credibility and in the whole-person section of \nthis decision.) He indicated that he changed from American to Filipino women in 2009 \nbecause of his concern for randomly seeing the same American woman in public after \ngiving her money online. The geographical location of Filipino women made Applicant \nfeel that there was less risk of randomly seeing a gifted Filipino again in public. (Tr. 99-\n100) When he began speaking individually to the Filipino women in 2009, he quickly \nlearned that they were searching for compensation which increased their flirtatious \nactivity with him, including showing more of their bodies to him. Applicant\u2019s interaction \nwith the females increased after he replaced one social media network with another. \nFrom 2009 to the fall of 2017, he conducted the online activity between about 11 p.m. \nand the early morning hours. This was his way of relaxing in a secured room with an \nalcoholic drink. Early on during these conversations, Applicant did not believe the \nwomen knew he was masturbating, but as time passed, he believed that most of the \nFilipino women became aware. (Tr. 66-71, 97-99, 107) \nMost of the conversations that Applicant had with the Filipinos were about \nvarious aspects of their lives, including their lack of money, a job, groceries, or \ntransportation. Applicant became happy when he saw how pleased the Filipino women \nbecame upon receiving his gifts of money. The more money he gave to them the \nhappier they became. Masturbating and having a drink enhanced Applicant\u2019s joy. A \nsizeable part of the time when he supplied money to the women, he masturbated. \nThroughout his activity with the Filipino females, Applicant recalled none of them having \nany ties to the Filipino government, the military, or the intelligence agencies. None of \nthe women raised questions about Applicant\u2019s employment. (Tr. 73-74, 76-78, 110) \nThe total amount of money that Applicant gave to the Filipino women from 2009 \nto 2017 was about $200,000. See GE 4. These recurring gifts had no impact on his US \nfinancial assets. His aggregate US income from 2009 through 2017 was approximately \n$1,915,000. His US net worth as of September 2021, including real property, \ninvestments and retirement accounts, is over $4,000,000. (Tr. 78-80) See AE D, AE E. \nApplicant maintained that his last sexual conversations and activities with \nFilipino women were in 2017, and his last live web cam activity with other women was in \n2019. When asked why he did not report the Filipino contacts to his facility security \nofficer (FSO), he mentioned his foreign-born wife and her family, and then stated he \nconsidered the Filipino contacts (involved in the sexual interaction) as being superficial \nand not serious, even though he interacted with one Filipino female for two years. See \nalso GE 3, a list of 30 Filipino women that he selected from the online payment systems \naccount he used to pay the Filipino women. Because he has foreign contacts at his job \nall the time, he does not report every foreign contact to his FSO, it is just a certain \nsegment of foreign contacts. (Tr. 105-106, 148-149) Applicant never received any \nsecurity training about interacting with foreign or domestic females.

His first response to the \nquestion did not seem to demonstrate an understanding of the question. In his second \nresponse, he explained that he enjoyed masturbating and analogized the behavior to \neating chocolate or a slice of cake. Then he stated that the addiction extended to giving \nmoney as well. Once he learned the sexual activity had negative national security \nimplications, he had no trouble stopping the behavior. He did not feel withdrawal \nsymptoms that a smoker might experience after he quit smoking. (AE 5 at 10; Tr. 89-91, \n143) After the electronic payment records system (GE 4) discontinued his account in the \nfall of 2017 for paying the Filipino women because of their policy prohibiting their service \nfrom being used for sexual purposes, Applicant had no trouble stopping the activity, and \ndid not understand why the expert d\n iagnosed the activity as compulsive. He stopped the \nweb cam activity in 2019 when his daughter found the hidden browser he was using to \nconduct the web cam activity with the models. (Tr. 91-92) \nApplicant indicated that he shut down two other network platforms and all \nonline pornographic activity within the same month in 2019. After the discovery, he \nstated that he talked with his family. A few days later he contacted his security office \nand did some research online where he found the sexual activity was a concern to the \nGovernment. (He did not testify about what he said to the FSO.) He indicated that he \ndeleted everything on the computer and talked to his wife. He did not intend to get \ninvolved in this type of sexual activity in the future. Although he resumed visiting other \nsocial media platforms, he would not have interaction as he had in the past. Currently, \nhis primary social media platform prohibits nudity. If someone tries to pressure him, he \nwill notify the authorities and probably talk with his wife. Applicant talked about therapy \nwith the expert and is willing to participate in therapy if the Government believes it will \nmake a difference. (Tr. 92-94, 136-137, 146) \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife discovered he masturbated and they agreed that he \nparticipate in counseling. He continued with counseling for about four years, but his wife \nresisted his efforts to continue therapy to improve their marriage. He did not inform the \nexpert of his 1999 counseling. Sex issues and intimacy, at least since 2010 or 2011, \nhave been the central issues of dispute throughout the marriage. In 2017 or 2018, \nApplicant and his wife attended marriage counseling that focused on sexual issues. The \ncounseling lasted about two years. On the recommendation of the counselor, his wife \nattended additional counseling, but he did not participate. Though he viewed the \ncounseling as beneficial, the therapy did not resolve their sexual issues. He did talk to \nthe expert about the marriage counseling, though she did not seem to recall whether the \nsubject was discussed. (Tr. 80-82, 123-130, 144-145, 151) \nSince 2019, Applicant considers his relationship with his wife has improved. \nThere appears to be more physical contact and fewer arguments. She is helping him \nmore and their communication is better. He believes that she enjoyed two vacations \nthey took together recently. Otherwise, the record does not reveal any lifestyle changes \nsince he stopped giving money to the Filipinos in 2017.

She \nsigned the affidavit on September 12, 2021, however a draft of the document was \ngenerated about nine months earlier in 2021. (Tr. 153-155; AE G) Applicant prepared \npart of the document and his wife made changes. She was not at the September 2021 \nhearing because she was not pleased with his online sexual activity. She initially did not \nwant to sign the document until he explained to her that the Federal Government would \nwant a statement from her. The affidavit represented a compromise. His wife, according \nto Applicant believed that he deserved the government action (security clearance \ninvestigation) that was being taken against him. (Tr. 82-83, 152-155) \nIn Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s September 2021 affidavit (AE G), she explained that she \nhas been married to Applicant for 25 years. She indicated she knows Applicant better \nthat any other person and, \u201cdespite the allegations in this case, I still feel like I know \n[Applicant] very well.\u201d He is a trustworthy husband and a responsible family man. \nApplicant\u2019s wife stated she was offended by his behavior and contrary to everything else \nin their life. His behavior caused marital stress that they both needed to reconcile. \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not believe that his social media conduct could be used to \npressure or coerce him, or jeopardize his judgment or ability to safeguard classified \ninformation. The last two lines of paragraph 7 appear to be in a different font than the \nother areas of the affidavit. See AE G. The credibility of the affidavit is diminished by \nApplicant\u2019s participation in creating the document and the interest Applicant\u2019s wife and \nApplicant have in the outcome of the case. Though she avers that she is aware of the \ncontents of the SOR, she never discussed what the behavior was or the large amount of \nmoney Applicant distributed to at least 200 Filipino women in the eight-year period. She \ndid not mention when Applicant\u2019s gifting terminated. His wife\u2019s initial reluctance to sign \nthe affidavit cannot be disregarded either. \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2009-2010, 01-2010 to 12-2010, 2013, \n2014, 2015, and 2020, \u201cexceeded expectations,\u201d or were \u201cextremely proficient.\u201d (AE B) \nThe pay bonus award records show that Applicant received yearly pay awards for 2011 \nthrough 2018.

Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a)  sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual \nhas been prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive high-risk behavior that the \nindividual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThere is no evidence in the record indicating that Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior \nwas criminal in nature. AG \u00b6 13(a) has not been established. Though there is no \nevidence inferring or suggesting that Applicant\u2019s masturbation is self-destructive or a \nhigh-risk type of behavior, he has a long history of interacting with Filipino women over \nsocial media. During a significant number of the social interactions, he would view and \nconverse with the women, then masturbate and dole out small portions of money to \nthem. In March 2021, his expert diagnosed his condition as a compulsive sexual \nbehavior disorder based on his inability to control strong and repeated sexual impulses. \nAG \u00b6 13(b) applies. From 2009 to the fall of 2017, Applicant gifted about $200,000 to \nmany Filipino women over social media. This pattern of conduct demonstrates a lack of \njudgment and makes him vulnerable to exploitation, duress, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) \nand 13(d) apply. \nAG \u00b6 14. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is \nno evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;  \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply to the facts of this case because Applicant was \nbetween 44 and 52 years old during the period he interacted with the Filipino women. \nThe applicability of AG \u00b6 14(b) depends on whether the conduct was recent or occurred \na long time ago. The passage of time since the sexual behavior ended should include \npositive evidence of changed circumstances aimed at reform that substantially reduces \nthe risk of future recurrence. \nApplicant\u2019s eight-year behavior with the Filipino women did not end until 2017, \nabout four years ago. However, the conduct was frequent, and did not occur under \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunusual circumstances. Regularly viewing up to about 200 women from 2009 through \nmost of 2017, and giving money to a significant portion of them, continues to cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability or good judgment. When asked whether he made any \nlifestyle changes since the end of the gifting (2017), there is no indication in the record \nthat he made rehabilitative changes in his lifestyle. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) does not fully apply. This conclusion is based on the lack of detailed \ninformation provided by his wife\u2019s affidavit. Though she insisted that she was completely \naware of Applicant\u2019s misconduct as described by the SOR, and that his online behavior \ncould not be used coerce him, she furnished no supporting details about what and when \nshe knew about the sexual behavior, the gifting, when the behavior stopped, and their \ncounseling. While Applicant initially informed the Government about his misconduct in \nSeptember 2019, he did not reveal his activity in his earlier March 2019 e-QIP because \nof his belief that the contacts were not contextually relevant nor serious. While the OPM \ninvestigator and parties to this security clearance case know about Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior, his employer does not know, and I can only speculate about what Applicant \nactually disclosed to his security office after he discovered that continued sexual \ninteraction could place his security clearance at risk. Though Applicant\u2019s sexual \nbehavior was private and consensual as set forth in (AG \u00b6 14(c), it fails to overcome the \nlack of judgment Applicant displayed under AG \u00b6 13(d). \nThere is no documented evidence of enrollment in or successful completion of a \ntreatment program. There is no evidence of compliance with a treatment plan or \nprognosis indicating that the behavior can be controlled. The expert\u2019s September 2021 \ndiagnosis that Applicant\u2019s March 2021 diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavior disorder \ndue to his persistent inability to control his sexual impulses, was \u201cin remission\u201d, is not \njustified. The expert\u2019s background shows that before this security clearance case, she \nhad never made a security clearance assessment in her career. Her lack of knowledge \nabout Applicant\u2019s treatment in 1999 for masturbation because he did not tell her, \nweakens her overall assessment of Applicant\u2019s honesty as one of the bases for her \nSeptember 2021 \u201cin remission\u201d diagnosis. She was not certain whether she was aware \nof Applicant\u2019s marital counseling in 2017 or 2018. She did not interview Applicant\u2019s wife \nto gain an added perspective on his behavior. She did not see the payment records \ntracking the gifting activity from 2009 to 2017. Given the expert\u2019s diagnostic impressions \nculminating in her recommendation that Applicant seek therapy to address his \nunderlying issues, which he has not done, I do not find the \u201cin remission\u201d portion of the \ndiagnosis adequately supported. AG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s sole reason for cultivating relationships with Filipino women was his \nconcern for randomly seeing the same American woman in public after giving her \nmoney online. The geographical location of the Filipino women made Applicant feel that \nthere was less risk of randomly seeing a gifted Filipino again in public. In sum, the \nwomen used for his sexual activity could have been from Europe or South America, just \nas long as a substantial amount of distance separated Applicant from the women. There \nis no evidence that his extensive contact with the Filipino women resulted in divided \nallegiance to the Philippines and the United States. There is no property or business \ninterest in the Philippines that makes him vulnerable to coercion in the country. While \nthe money he gave to the Filipino women could have caused him to become a target for \nforeign influence, there is no evidence that any action was ever taken by a Filipino \nwoman to increase Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to current or possible future inducement or \ncoercion. Based on the record evidence, I sua sponte withdraw this guideline from the \nSOR. In addition, the factual allegations under Guideline B are already addressed under \nthe first paragraph of the SOR (Guideline D). SOR 2.a and 2.b are combined into SOR \n1.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n12 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________ \nApplicant has been married since 1995. He has two teenage children. He has \nworked for his employer since 2004. His performance evaluations and monetary awards \nshow that he has been a productive employee. He has held a security clearance since \n2009. \nBecause I am obligated to evaluate the evidence as whole, I address the \nevidence that weighs against Applicant\u2019s security clearance application. Applicant has a \nlengthy history of compulsive sexual behavior with Filipino women characterized by \nregularly giving away over $200,000 to Filipino women between 2009 and 2017. He was \nbetween 44 and 52 years old, when he engaged in this activity. There is evidence that \nhe began this gifting activity between 2000 and 2009, though he could not remember \nthe number of females or the monetary amounts he presented to these women. While \nhe asserted that he discussed therapy with his expert, and that he was willing to seek \ntreatment if it would help, Applicant furnished no documented evidence of treatment, \ncounseling, or therapy. Having weighed all the evidence under the specific conditions in \nthe context of the whole-person factors, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the sexual behavior guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \n \nWITHDRAWN \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

So as of right now, they are appearing as unfiled. Additionally, we \nbelieve that there is an outstanding balance from the 2012 taxes that we \nare working to identify, validate and make payment arrangements for. \nThe IRS should have all filings now and we are currently and have been\npaying $445 per month toward our tax debt while we negotiate additional\ntax payment terms with our IRS representative (GE 1). \n \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant estimated his tax debt to be $40,000.

He told \nthe investigator that he had an accountant who failed to file Applicant\u2019s 2012, 2013, and \n2014 income tax returns. He did not realize it until an IRS agent came to his house in \n2017 and told him. Applicant stated that when he looked at his tax returns he noticed the \npreparer\u2019s name was not on the documents. He believed his returns fell through the \ncracks.

He said at that time he had been \nmaking $445 payments per month since 2017. He said he and his wife realized they could \nnot afford to make the $445 monthly payments, and the IRS deferred payments until it \nfinished its audit. Over the past year he had not made payments because they were filing \nIRS form 433A quarterly, which is used to obtain current financial information necessary \nfor determining how a wage earner or self-employed individual can satisfy an outstanding \nliability. Applicant was expecting a new payment plan from the IRS. Post-hearing, \nApplicant provided documents to support he made payments of $445 to the IRS from \nSeptember 2014 to January 2016.

He was confronted with an unpaid \n2013 state tax lien and he said he was unsure about it, but would look into it. His 2013 \nstate tax lien was released in July 2016; his April 2014 state tax lien was released in July \n2015; and his May 2017 state lien was released in October 2017.

He was \ndue refunds of $526, $1,012 and $4,131 that were applied to the balance owed for tax \nyear 2012. (Tr. 78GE 3) \nApplicant testified that in 2010 he began using a new accounting firm (AF) to \nhandle his tax returns. He provided unsigned copies of Form 8879 IRS e-file Signature \nAuthorization for years 2013, 2014, and 2015. IRS Form 8879 has a signature block for \nthe filer and spouse to sign authorizing AF to generate a PIN to electronically file the tax \nreturn. AF completed each form for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and included \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s name, Social Security numbers, gross income, taxable income, \nand whether they owed taxes or were due a refund. Attached to each years\u2019 IRS forms \nwere cover letters from AF stating the due date was \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and for tax \nyear 2013 Applicant was required to pay $24,776; tax year 2014 authorized to receive a \nrefund of $1,935; and tax year 2015 authorized to receive a refund of $4,786.

The forms for all three years \nprovided by Applicant were unsigned. (Tr. 36; AE O) \nApplicant testified that he signed the tax returns and was told they would be filed \nelectronically. He remembered the accountant was going to file extensions for some \nyears. Applicant testified that he could not find copies of his tax returns. He previously \ntold the government investigator during his 2018 interview that he had reviewed his \nreturns and noticed the preparer\u2019s name was missing from the returns. He did not provide \nevidence that he submitted payment for his 2013 taxes at the time it was due. The IRS \ntranscripts corroborate 2013, 2014, and 2015 were not filed until 2017. He testified he did \nnot know who filed these returns, whether it was AF or the tax network he more recently \nhired. (Tr. 36-45, 96; GE 2; AE O) \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing statement and documents, he provided AE O and he \nstated it showed AF had a power of attorney to sign Applicant\u2019s tax returns. This document \ndoes not reflect AF had a power of attorney. Applicant\u2019s statement is contrary to the \ninformation provided in the document. \nApplicant testified that he was unaware his tax returns had not been filed until an \nIRS agent came to his house in 2017 and told him he had unfiled tax returns and owed \nfederal taxes. Applicant said he spoke with his accountant at the time his 2013 tax returns \nwere prepared in 2014 and was aware he owed taxes. He said he and the accountant \nhad an agreement that the accountant was to file the 2013 return and then set up a \npayment plan because Applicant could not pay what was owed at that time. He said he \ntrusted the accountant to tell him what he needed to do. He testified that he was aware \nhe did not timely file his 2010 to 2015 tax returns. In 2014 he had an installment plan to \npay his tax debt. (Tr. 37-45, 61-64; AE C, D) \nApplicant testified that he did not go back to AF to retrieve any of his documents \nor paperwork because he wanted to get his tax returns filed and arrange a payment plan. \nHe said he could no longer trust him. He hired a different tax service to help him resolve \nhis tax issues. He also stated that he thought AF was going to assist him in delaying \npayment of his taxes because Applicant had other expenses he needed to pay. He was \naware taxes were owed for certain years and he was hopeful AF could get the payments \ndeferred until he was able to get money to make the payments. He further stated that he \nconsciously was not paying his taxes because he needed to get money together to pay \nthem. He stated that he did not have instructions on how to pay the taxes because his \nwife usually handled the taxes. He assumed his wife was handling everything. Instructions \nfor how to pay the taxes were provided on AF\u2019s cover sheet to IRS Form 8879. He testified \nthat his wife was responsible for arranging a payment plan and he wrote the check. (Tr. \n45-51, 61-66; AE O) \nApplicant provided copies of email correspondence between him or his wife and \nDM who works at AF, and was the person who was to prepare Applicant\u2019s tax returns. In \nApril 2017, Applicant reached out to DM after being contacted by the IRS about his failure \nto file multiple tax years\u2019 returns.

DM stated he would look into it and then stated \u201cYou\u2019ve filed all the required \n1040s to date. Thus you are current, though there may be some short of tax.\u201d (AE D). DM \ndoes not say when they were filed, but only as of April 2017 they were filed. There is an \nemail from DM to Applicant\u2019s wife dated October 15, 2015, indicating their 2014 tax \nreturns had been submitted. (AE B, C, Q) \nAnother email provided states that DM was providing copies of the returns. \nApplicant testified he did not have copies or he could not find them. Applicant\u2019s wife \nquestioned why DM was delaying sending them copies of the returns. In her email she \nstated that she believed it was because DM likely had not completed the returns. She \nasked DM to provide documentation that the returns were filed on time and told him she \nhad asked him a number of times if the returns were submitted and he had assured her \nthey were. The email correspondence did not provide an explanation or clarification \nregarding when the returns were filed, except as noted above for the 2014 return. DM \nonly said he could probably get the penalty waived. (AE B, C) \nApplicant testified that he is aware that mistakes were made regarding his taxes. \nHe should have been more actively involved each year and made it a priority to timely file \nand pay or have a payment plan in place. He was aware that he should have set money \naside to pay his taxes when he did not pay estimated taxes. He testified that he did not \nreally pay attention, and relied on his accountant and his wife to handle the tax matters. \nHe has learned from his mistake. He is now actively involved regarding his taxes. (TR. \n73-74). \nApplicant did not have an explanation for why his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns \nwere filed late and within several months of each other. He stated it was a decision made \nby AF and his wife. He stated he did not have any documentary proof to show he went to \nthe AF\u2019s office before each year\u2019s taxes were due and signed his returns. (Tr. 82-85) \nApplicant testified that he sold his house in July 2021 and paid $52,199 to resolve \nhis tax liabilities. His tax lien was released in August 2021. (AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleged a judgment entered against Applicant in August 2013 ($2,999), \nwhich was satisfied in February 2016. He stated this debt was for a golf club membership \nthat he could no longer afford and was canceled. He had no explanation for why he failed \nto disclose it on his SCA. (Tr. 103-104; GE 4; AE E) SOR \u00b6 1.k ($535) alleged a judgment \nentered against Applicant in August 2011. In his SOR answer, he disputed the judgment \nand said the creditor had problems with their bookkeeping and then he was not able to \nlocate a representative, and he believes the judgment is in error. He did not offer any \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate that the judgment is not valid. The account is for a \nsocial club that Applicant used to network with people of affluence. This judgment is not \nresolved. (Tr. 105-111; GE 4) \nThere are two judgments entered and two collection accounts against Applicant \nfrom the same collection creditor.

(Tr. \n111-113, 115; GE 4; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($945) is a judgment (same creditor) filed in February 2013 and \nrecorded under its original creditors name. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he \ndisputed it. There is no indication he had the judgment overturned. It is not resolved. (Tr. \n111-113; GE 4, 5) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q ($1,670, same creditor) was disputed by Applicant. He \nstated in his SOR answer that he did have a delinquent account with this creditor in May \n2018, and he paid the debt in full. He did not provide evidence of his payment. The last \nactivity on this account was 2011.

Applicant stated in his SOR he had a credit card with the \ncreditor 13 to15 years ago, and he had not received any correspondence from the creditor \nfor the past 7 to 10 years. He testified that he reached out to the creditor, but it could not \nfind the account. He admitted the account could have been delinquent years ago. Due to \nthe age of the account, it likely was removed from his recent credit reports. Post-hearing, \nApplicant stated that he was able to find the current collection company for the account, \nand he resolved the debt with a payment of $1,362. It is resolved.

Applicant denied these debts because \nhe currently has other accounts with the creditors that are in good standing. He stated he \nmay have had a couple late payments on these accounts in the past. Due to the age of \nthese debts they are no longer on his recent credit report and were likely removed. (Tr. \n125-133; GE 5, 6, 7, 8) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.r ($923) is a collection account.

The last activity on this debt was June 2011. It \ndoes not appear on subsequent credit reports, likely due to its age.

The debt is reflected on \nApplicant\u2019s October 2017 credit report as a collection account, but did not include a last \nactivity date. It was assigned in December 2014.

In his answer \nto the SOR, Applicant misconstrues the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, believing it alleged that \nhe failed to disclose his federal tax issues. That was not alleged. \nThe SOR alleged Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his state tax liens and \nfour judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.m. Evidence supports that the 2013 and \n2014 state tax liens were paid before the SCA. The 2017 state tax lien was entered in \nMay 2017 and paid in October 2017. Applicant testified that he did not know there were \nliens entered regarding the state taxes he owed when he completed the SCA. (Tr. 97) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he owed the judgment against him \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j and he satisfied it in 2016. He denied the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.k and denied \nhe was aware of the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file and pay his federal income taxes for multiple tax \nyears. He had federal and state tax liens entered against him. He had multiple judgments \nentered against him and multiple delinquent debts beginning in 2011. Applicant has a \nlong history of failing to pay his financial obligations. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem or provides evidence of \naction s to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence provided is somewhat confusing, in that Applicant claims he did not \nknow his 2013, 2014, and 2015 income tax returns were not timely filed. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant\u2019s tax issues began when he failed to timely file his 2010 federal \nincome tax return. He was notified by the IRS in May 2012 when they sent an inquiry \nregarding his failure to file. This happened again for his 2011 tax return, when an inquiry \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas sent in May 2013 regarding his failure to timely file and pay his taxes, which were \neventually paid in 2016. He also failed to timely file his 2012 federal income tax return. \nI find the IRS tax transcripts the most probative evidence. Applicant did not provide \nsigned copies of IRS form 8879 showing that he authorized AF to file tax returns for 2013, \n2014, and 2015. He told the government investigator that he reviewed his tax returns and \nnoticed the preparer\u2019s signature was missing. At his hearing, he stated he did not have \ncopies of those returns. In his answer to interrogatories, he provided the dates he filed \nhis federal tax returns, some of which were contradicted by the tax transcripts. He also \ntold the government investigator that his federal tax lien was paid in 2018. It was not paid \nand released until 2021. He testified that he was aware he had a large federal tax debt \nfor 2013 and discussed with AF delaying the payment because he did not have the \nmoney. The IRS repeatedly sent notices to Applicant regarding his unfiled tax returns. \nThere is evidence that DM confirmed to Applicant in an October 2015 email that the 2014 \ntax return was submitted. I have considered that Applicant believed AF had filed his 2013, \n2014, and 2015 tax returns. Even if he believed that AF had timely filed his tax returns on \nhis behalf, he was receiving notices from the IRS regarding the unfiled tax returns and \nshould have taken action. He was also aware he owed taxes for 2013 and was attempting \nto delay payment. \nThe evidence also shows that Applicant had tax issues prior to the years he said \nAF failed to file his federal tax returns. The evidence shows he failed to timely file his 2010 \nfederal tax return and failed to timely file and pay his 2011 and 2012 tax obligations. His \n2011 taxes were paid in 2016. It appears the balance of his 2012 taxes were paid in 2021 \nafter he sold his house and paid the entirety of the federal tax lien. I cannot find that \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to comply with tax requirements occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was working with the IRS and was arranging \ninstallment agreements for his 2011 and 2012 delinquent taxes. However, there is \ninsufficient evidence to show his failures to pay his taxes were beyond his control for \nthese and other tax years. Applicant\u2019s testified he was aware of a large tax debt for 2013 \nthat he was unable to pay on time. He failed to provide sufficient evidence and explain \nwhy he did not pay judgments and other debts that were in collection. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided information that he is currently enrolled in a \nfinancial management course. AG \u00b6 20(c) has some application. Applicant has satisfied \nsome judgments and paid some of his delinquent debts and AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to them \nin that they are resolved. It does not apply to the unpaid judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and \n1.m. His failure to pay his debts until judgments were entered undermines that he made \ngood-faith efforts to repay his overdue creditors. \nApplicant disputed many of the alleged debts. His delinquent debts were on his \nearlier credit report and many of the debts he disputed very likely were removed due to \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntheir age. I have resolved those debts that are no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit report in his \nfavor, however, it does not negate that these debts were legitimate debts reflected on his \n2017 credit report and remained unpaid for years. AG \u00b6 20(e) has some application. \nApplicant paid his federal tax lien in 2021 and paid his state tax liens. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies to his delinquent tax filings and payments. Although, he has resolved his tax \nissues, it does not negate his years of failing to comply with tax rules and regulations. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI have considered all of the evidence and there is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate. I find in his favor on this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n \n \n \n \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a history of failing to timely file and pay his federal income taxes. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by \nwell-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16- \n01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree \nof good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). Applicant\u2019s history of \nnon-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely file and pay his federal \nincome taxes and timely pay his state income taxes raises serious concerns. \nApplicant also failed to timely pay debts until after judgments were entered. Many \nof his other debts dropped off his credit report due to age. Although his federal and state \ntaxes are now paid and some of his judgments have been satisfied, he has not \nestablished a reliable financial track record. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. There was insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts and I find for him under \nGuideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.j: \nSubparagraph  1.k: \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on December 7, 2020, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on December 15, 2021, and reassigned to me on February 3, \n2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on February 10, 2022.

He has two associate\u2019s degrees that he earned in 2006 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree that he earned in 2010. He has never married, and he has no \nchildren. (Tr. at 12-13, 30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributed to periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. (Tr. at 28-41, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1) The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $61,660. The debts include \na payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a - $587), three defaulted student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - $21,609; \n1.c - $15,211; and 1.f - $11,909), the deficiency balances owed on two auto loans after \none vehicle was stolen, and the other vehicles was repossessed and sold (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - \n$1,731 and 1.e - $9,246), and three miscellaneous accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - $480; 1.h - \n$431; and 1.f - $457). Applicant owed all of the debts at one time, but all but two have \nbeen paid or settled. Specific debts are addressed below. \nApplicant paid the delinquent $587 payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in November 2020. \nHe settled the $1,731 deficiency balance owed on an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for $596, \nwith the payment made in November 2020. He settled the $9,246 deficiency balance \nowed on an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e) for $4,500, with payments completed by February \n2021. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, E, I) \nApplicant settled the $11,909 defaulted student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f) for $5,000. He \npaid $2,500 in November 2020 and another $2,500 in January 2021 as settlement in \nfull. He settled the $480 loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) for $300, which was paid in November 2020. \nHe settled the $431 and $457 debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i) to the same credit union for \n$877, with the payment in November 2021. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, D, F) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege $21,609 and $15,2118 defaulted student loans owed \nto the U.S. Department of Education. Applicant asserted that he unsuccessfully \nattempted to defer the loans or have them placed in forbearance when he was \nunemployed. He stated that his paychecks were eventually garnished, and his income \ntax refunds were seized for the loans. He established a $5 per month payment plan, but \nhe said that the collections branch failed to keep track of the payments. (Tr. at 42-43; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nIn January 2020, Applicant applied for a borrower defense discharge of his \nfederal student loans. (Tr. at 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C) He stated in his \nresponse to the SOR: \nDue to nefarious actions by the Department of Education, which was \nissuing blanket denials of Borrower Defense applications without \nconsidering the claims, a law suit was filed and there is currently litigation \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto determine how the processing of the Borrower Defense Applications will \nbe treated by the Department of Education. \nDocuments provided by Applicant show the two defaulted student loans alleged \nin the SOR and two additional student loans that were not alleged in the SOR. The \nprincipal owed on the four loans is $50,860 and the interest owed is $12,163, for a total \nof $63,023. (Tr. at 49-51; AE G) \nApplicant\u2019s student-loan payment records show seven payments of $145 \nbetween October 2013 and July 2014, followed by monthly $5 payments from October \n2014 through March 2015. However, the $5 payments in January, February, and March \n2015 were reversed. Another $5 payment was made in May 2015. His wages were \ngarnished a total of $2,152 between April and October 2016. All of those payments \nwere applied to interest and fees, with none going to the principal. (Tr. at 43, 46; AE H) \nApplicant resumed making $5 monthly payments in December 2016, which \ncontinued through November 2017. He made a single $5 payment in July 2018. In \nFebruary 2019, $1,095 was withheld from his federal income tax refund and applied to \nthe loans. He made five payments of $5 between August and December 2019, however \ntwo of those payments were reversed. He made a $100 payment in January 2022. (Tr. \nat 46-48; AE H, K, L) \nApplicant stated that he borrowed about $37,000 in student loans, and he does \nnot understand how he now owes about $63,000. He did not appear to have a handle \non the concept of compound interest and how if more than the interest is not paid, the \nloan can balloon to much more than what was borrowed. He admitted that he was \u201cnot a \nmath guy.\u201d Even though he does not completely agree with the amount owed, he \nentered into a $463 per month payment agreement in January 2022. He made a $465 \npayment in February 2022. He intends to honor the agreement. He realizes now that if \nhe does not start addressing the loans with payments going toward the principal, absent \naction from the federal government or a favorable result from the lawsuit, the loans will \ncontinue to grow. (Tr. at 50-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE K, L) \nApplicant paid several debts that were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2022 credit report listed four accounts that were a total of $567 past due. He \nowed the IRS about $1,200 for tax year 2019, but he has been paying the IRS and \nreduced the amount owed to about $400. He acknowledged that he made some \nfinancial mistakes, but he has learned valuable lessons. His finances are the best they \nhave been in years. He has a good job that pays well. He plans to bring his accounts \ncurrent and continue to pay his other accounts, including his taxes and student loans. \nHe has not received financial counseling. (Tr. at 69-79, 84; GE 2-4) \nApplicant called a witness, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to \nhis excellent job performance and moral character. He is praised for his trustworthiness, \nwork ethic, honesty, reliability, loyalty, professionalism, competency, dependability, and \nintegrity.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans, \nunpaid auto loans, and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant owed all of the debts at one time, and all but two student loans have \nbeen paid or settled. He started resolving the SOR debts in November 2020, which is \nabout the time that the SOR was issued. He also paid non-SOR debts before the SOR \nwas issued. \nLike many Americans, Applicant did not have a good handle on his student loans \nand the relentless power of compound interest. His payment history shows payments \nsince October 2013, but some were as low as $5; some were reversed; some were by \ngarnishment; and one was from an income tax refund. He instituted a $463 per month \npayment agreement in January 2022, and he made the first payment in February 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but perfection is not required. He let four \naccounts become $567 past due. He owed the IRS about $1,200 for tax year 2019, but \nhe has been paying the IRS and reduced the amount owed to about $400. He \nacknowledged that he made some financial mistakes, but he has learned valuable \nlessons. His finances are the best they have been in years. He has a good job that pays \nwell. He plans to bring his accounts current and continue to pay his other accounts, \nincluding his taxes and student loans. \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.1 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n1. The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances.  \n7 \n",
