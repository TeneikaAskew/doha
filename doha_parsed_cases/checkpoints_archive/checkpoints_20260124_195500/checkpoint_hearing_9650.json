On March 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received her response on April 16, \n2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 5, 2009. On May 7, \n2009, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 14, \n2009, scheduling the hearing for June 4, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government submitted a List of Government Exhibits, \nExhibit (Ex.) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were \nreceived without objection, and testified on her own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until June 19, 2009 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on her behalf. Applicant timely submitted \nAE G through J, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. \u2013 1.c., 1.e. \u2013 1.h., 1.j., 1.l. and denied 1.a., 1.d., \n1.i., l.k. and 1.m. \u2013 1.n.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old functional area supervisor, who has worked for her \ndefense contractor employer since January 2004. GE 1, Tr. 17-18. She successfully \nheld a security clearance from 1982 to 1999 while employed for a defense contractor. \nTr. 22. Applicant again seeks a security clearance, which her employer requires as a \ncondition of her continued employment. Tr. 30-31, 80.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1968. She did not pursue further \neducation beyond high school. Tr. 17. She has never married; however, she has \nmaintained a long-term relationship with the father of her sons. Her oldest son is \nmarried with a family and is self-supporting. Her youngest son, who is 22 years old, \nlives with her. He is currently unemployed and is solely dependent on Applicant for \nsupport. Tr. 18-19. Applicant and her life partner own the home they live in free and \nclear and share expenses. Tr. 47-48, 76. Her life partner has not worked in two years, \nhaving sustained a work-related injury as a driver for a railroad company. He initially \nwas receiving Workers\u2019 Compensation, and is now receiving unemployment \ncompensation. Tr. 49-50. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her e-QIP, her March 2009 and April 2008 credit reports, and \nher February 2009 Responses to Interrogatories. GE 1 \u2013 4.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 14 separate debts, which included three civil \njudgments, and the remaining delinquent debts included credit cards, student loans, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmedical bills, and telephone or cable bills. Total debts alleged approximated \n$29,000.00. Tr. 11.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began following a lengthy period of employment \nfrom October 1999 to August 2001. She lost her job as a government contract \nemployee when the government facility closed where she was assigned. Tr. 31. When \nshe did return to work in August 2001, she took a substantial pay cut with her new \nemployer until she left in December 2003. Tr. 32-33. It was not until she secured her \npresent job that she was able to earn sufficient income to meet her expenses. \n \nSince her SOR was issued, Applicant has made substantial progress in \nresolving her debts. At her hearing, she submitted a comprehensive plan that \ndocuments past and present action taken with regard to her debts. She has \nconsolidated her student loans, contacted creditors and initiated payment plans and is \nmaking payments on those plans, paid off individual creditors, eliminated duplicate \naccounts, and disputed one account. AE A \u2013 F, AE J. While she still owes a balance \non the majority of debts, she has demonstrated her good-faith effort to repay her \ncreditors or otherwise resolve her debts. Tr. 33-70, 73-76. \n \nHer 2008 1040 federal income return reflects an adjusted gross income of \n$36,383.00. Her post-hearing monthly expense sheet reflects she lives a modest \nlifestyle and has a net monthly remainder after she has paid all of her bills. AE D, AE I.  \n \nApplicant provided her 2008 Annual Management Performance Review, which \nreflected above average performance. Given her performance level, her supervisor \nrecommended her for a pay raise. AE G. Her employer also awarded her with a \nSpecial Recognition Award for meeting 2008 company goals. AE H. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owed substantial debt as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.n. through her admissions and evidence presented. At the time the \nSOR was issued in July 2008, Applicant owed 14 debts approximating $29,000.00 \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from a lengthy period of underemployment and \nunemployment. Additionally, she is supporting her 22-year-old son who is currently \nunemployed. These factors directly contributed to Applicant\u2019s past financial \nindebtedness.  \n \nHer financial situation has substantially improved as a result of finding a job \nwhich provides her with enough income to support her family and meet her financial \nobligations. \nShe \nhas \ndeveloped \na \ncomprehensive \nstrategy \nsupported \nby \ndocumentation that she has gained control of her finances. She is meeting her \nobligations to the best of her ability while maintaining a modest lifestyle. Applicant has \nestablished a credible budget and submitted post-hearing updates on her financial \nprogress. All indicators point to an individual who has taken this process quite \nseriously and taken what appears to be all reasonable steps to correct her financial \nsituation. What is different now as opposed to before is she has the means, tools, and \nresolve to achieve financial stability. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are three potentially mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of action to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because at the time Applicant incurred the debts, she was \neither underemployed or unemployed. Her financial situation continued to deteriorate \nuntil she was able to secure her present job. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies because Applicant \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nLastly, AG \u00b6 20(e) applies because Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nchallenging the validity of one of her debts. In short, Applicant has made substantial \nprogress in turning her financial situation around. She has established a viable budget, \nwhich shows a net remainder after her monthly bills are paid. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I also gave \nconsiderable weight to her years of successfully holding a clearance, her service as a \ndefense contractor, her favorable financial history before she lost her job in 1999, and \nher efforts to date in attaining financial responsibility. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis also supports a \nfavorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.n.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 19, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 21, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge erred in making two\nfindings; (2) whether the Judge erred in her treatment of pertinent mitigating conditions; and (3)\nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary or capricious.  For the reasons that follow, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant used marijuana about ten\ntimes between July 2001 to at least May 2003.  He began using it in college, continued to use it\nduring an internship in Europe, and last used it on Memorial Day 2003.  On that day he was at a\nparty with friends and smoked it in a Turkish pipe.  Applicant also used psilocybin mushrooms on\nfour separate occasions, twice in February 2002, and twice in December 2006.  In 2004, Applicant\napplied for a security clearance that was granted sometime in 2005 with the understanding that he\nwas no longer using illegal drugs.  He knew that the use of illegal drugs was against the law and\nprohibited by his company.  On New Year\u2019s Eve 2006, he used psilocybin mushrooms while holding\na DoD security clearance.  In May 2004, Applicant provided a statement to the Department of\nDefense indicating that he had no intent of ever using illegal drugs in the future.  Applicant repeated\nthis statement of intent at the hearing.  He states that he has made a lifestyle change and made a\ndeliberate attempt to reduce the frequency of contact with his friends that use illegal drugs.  He also\nsubmitted a notarized letter of intent where he states that he will not repeat his past illegal drug use\nand states his understanding that if he does use drugs, his security clearance would be subject to\nautomatic revocation.  Applicant was asked by his company to apply for an SCI clearance.  Instead\nof telling the truth about his use of illegal drugs, he submitted a falsified security clearance\napplication in June or July 2006 and intentionally omitted his most recent use of psilocybin\nmushrooms.  Prior to going into a polygraph exam, Applicant confessed to the examiner that he had\nnot been truthful on the application.  In June 2007, Applicant was denied program access due in part\nto his illegal drug use.  Applicant has undergone drug tests that have all come back with negative\nresults.  Applicant underwent a psychological examination on January 22, 2010 administered by a\npractitioner of his choice.  The results of the examination indicate that Applicant tests with a low\nprobability of substance abuse and substance dependence.  \nThe Judge reached the following conclusions in the case: The Government had met its initial\nburden of proving that Applicant had a history of illegal drug use (Guideline H) and dishonesty\n(Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicated poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Applicant knew at the time of his drug use that it\nwas illegal and against company policy.  Although his most recent use of any controlled substance\noccurred in 2006, over four years ago, he told the Government in 2004 that he had no intent of future\ndrug use and then broke his word.  Given his past history, there was no guarantee that he would\nremain drug free in the future or that his word could be relied upon.  None of the Guideline H\nmitigating conditions were applicable.  Furthermore, Applicant deliberately provided false\ninformation to the Government in 2006 concerning his illegal drug use in the past.  He only\nconfessed his drug use when faced with a polygraph.  This conduct displayed dishonesty and an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and showed a pattern of unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness.  None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions were applicable.  Under a whole-\nperson analysis, despite letters of recommendation and a high performance appraisal, Applicant\ndisregarded the law, company policy and DoD regulation, revealing a defect in judgment that could\nnot be ignored.  Applicant failed to overcome the Government\u2019s case opposing his request for a\nsecurity clearance.   \n\n1The same document also contains a single reference to the last mushroom use being in December 2005.  The\nmultiple references to December 2006 mushroom use appear to be initialized corrections to original references to a\nDecember 2005 date.  There is no evidence in the file to explain the internal inconsistencies in this document.  It is\npossible that the lone reference to December 2005 was not corrected as a matter of oversight.  In any event, despite the\ninternal inconsistencies, the document provides ample support for the Judge\u2019s finding.\nApplicant asserts that the Judge erred by making a finding that he intentionally used\nmarijuana on Memorial Day 2003.  Applicant states that his use on that occasion was unintentional\nas he was at a party and a Turkish pipe was being used to consume a mixture of tobacco and\nmarijuana.  Applicant claims that inasmuch as the Turkish pipe was normally used to smoke\ntobacco, he was unaware that the pipe contained marijuana until he smoked it.  Applicant also\nasserts that the Judge erred by finding that his last use of psilocybin mushrooms was in 2006 instead\nof 2005.  The Board will not disturb a Judge\u2019s findings of fact unless there has been a showing that\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0592 at 4 (App. Bd. May 4, 1999); ISCR Case No. 97-0630 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 28, 1998).  Applicant has failed to establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not contain a discussion of record evidence where Applicant\nstated that his use of marijuana in May 2003 was unintentional (Government Exhibits 3 and 4).\nHowever, the record contains Applicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR that he used\nmarijuana in 2003 and his answer to a question on his security clearance questionnaire wherein he\nadmitted to marijuana use in May 2003.  In neither of these instances did Applicant qualify his\nanswer by indicating that his May 2003 use was inadvertent.  The Judge was free to evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s explanation concerning the circumstances surrounding his May 2003 marijuana use, but\nshe was not compelled to accept Applicant\u2019s explanation.  Although not commented upon by the\nJudge, the fact that the marijuana was being consumed in a Turkish pipe at a party supports, rather\nthan detracts from, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s May 2003 marijuana use was knowing and\nintentional.  The Judge\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that his last use of psilocybin mushrooms took\nplace at the end of 2005 and not at the end of 2006 as the Judge found.  Applicant points to the\nJudge\u2019s finding that he falsified a security clearance application in June or July 2006 in support of\nhis assertion that the last use must have occurred at the end of 2005 rather than at the end of 2006,\notherwise it would have been impossible for him to lie about it in mid-year 2006.  A review of the\nrecord evidence convinces the Board that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant last used psilocybin\nmushrooms in December 2006 is sustainable.\nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant falsified a security clearance application dated\nJanuary 4, 2007.  This falsification is referenced in Govt. Exhibit 2.  Thus, the Judge\u2019s finding of\na falsification in June or July 2006 that Applicant relies on is in error. Also, there is ample support\nfor the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s last use of psilocybin mushrooms took place in December\n2006.  Applicant admitted without qualification an SOR allegation that alleged he used psilocybin\nmushrooms until at least December 2006.  In his response to a question about drug use on a security\nclearance application completed in June 2007, Applicant indicated his mushroom use as ending in\nDecember 2006 (Govt. Exhibit 1).  In a written statement dated May 23, 2008, Applicant made three\nreferences to mushroom use in December 2006 (Govt. Exhibit 3).1 Applicant has failed to establish\n\n2\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n3In this case, the Guideline E allegations in the SOR merely incorporate the drug use allegations found under\nGuideline H, with the addition of an allegation stating that Applicant was denied program access through another agency\nin part due to his illegal drug use.\nerror on the part of the Judge with regard to this finding.    \n \nApplicant objects to the manner in which the Judge handled the Guideline H and Guideline\nE mitigating conditions.  He notes that the Judge\u2019s decision contains no discussion of the individual\nmitigating conditions and does not go point by point through each mitigating condition to explain\nwhy that particular mitigating condition was not applicable to the case.  Applicant states that the\nJudge\u2019s lack of explanation about the applicability of the mitigating conditions coupled with the lack\nof any other explanation, \u201cmakes the ruling feel arbitrary.\u201d\nRegarding Guideline H, the Board notes that the Judge\u2019s treatment of the mitigating\nconditions is cursory.  While DOHA administrative judges have broad latitude concerning the\nmanner in which they write decisions, such cursory treatment of applicable mitigating conditions\nwould constitute harmful error absent some suitable explanation (not necessarily tied to specific\nprovisions of the mitigating conditions) as to why the Government\u2019s security concerns had not been\novercome.  In this case, contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge did provide a detailed\nexplanation as to why she did not conclude that the Guideline H concerns had been mitigated.  She\ncited the facts that Applicant used illegal drugs while working for his current employer, while\nholding a security clearance, and with the specific knowledge that the use was illegal and against\ncompany policy.  The Judge also noted that, although his most recent use of any controlled\nsubstance occurred over four years ago, Applicant told the Government in 2004 that he had no intent\nto use illegal drugs in the future and then broke his word.  From these facts the Judge ultimately\nconcluded that, given Applicant\u2019s past history, his word cannot be relied upon and the possibility\nof his returning to drugs is high enough to constitute an unacceptable security risk.  The Judge\u2019s\nexplanation is adequate and her conclusions are sustainable.  Indeed, although her decision does not\nspecifically mention Guideline H Mitigating Condition \u00b6 26 (a),2 her conclusions track essentially\nthe same considerations that appear in that mitigating guideline, principal among them being an\nexplanation as to why the drug use was not mitigated after the passage of a considerable length of\ntime (four years).\nApplicant\u2019s claim of error under Guideline E presents an unusual problem.  Applicant\u2019s\ncomplaints about the Judge\u2019s treatment of the Guideline E mitigating conditions concern those\nmitigating conditions that relate to falsification since the Judge based her adverse conclusions under\nGuideline E squarely on falsification and then failed to discuss any applicable mitigating conditions.\nHere, the Judge\u2019s failure to discuss the applicability of any of the mitigating conditions is of a\ngreater magnitude than under Guideline H since she provided very little in the way of an\nindependent discussion as to why the security concerns were not mitigated.  There is a more\nfundamental problem with the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E, however, that creates a problem\nfor the Board because it is not specifically alleged as an error by Applicant.  Although the SOR\ncontained allegations under Guideline E, those allegations did not include falsification.3  \n\n4One could also make allowances for Applicant\u2019s pro se status on appeal, although this point is complicated\nby the fact that Applicant was represented by counsel below, and no objection was raised nor motion in limine offered\nby Applicant\u2019s counsel when the evidentiary portion of the hearing and closing arguments became focused on the issue\nof Applicant\u2019s falsification.  Of course, regardless of the course of the hearing, neither party can know beforehand how\na Judge will write his or her decision in a case. \n5Of course, the evidence of Applicant\u2019s falsification could have been used legitimately for limited purposes.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004).  An overall reading of the Judge\u2019s decision in this case,\nhowever, makes clear that the Judge\u2019s reliance on the falsification evidence far exceeded this limited use.\nThe scope of review by the Board is limited to a consideration of the material issues raised\nby the parties. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.  By objecting to the Judge\u2019s treatment (or lack thereof) of the\nGuideline E mitigating conditions without objecting to the fact that falsification was not alleged in\nthe SOR, Applicant arguably placed this procedural anomaly beyond the scope of the Board\u2019s\nreview.  Nevertheless, it could also be argued that, in the broadest sense, Applicant is taking issue\nwith the Judge\u2019s overall analysis under Guideline E.4  Regardless of the merits of these arguments,\nit would be untenable for the Board to address Applicant\u2019s stated objections to the Judge\u2019s  treatment\nof the mitigating conditions while ignoring the larger, related problem of the Judge basing her\nGuideline E analysis exclusively on falsification when there was no basis for doing so under the\nparameters set forth in the SOR5.  An applicant is entitled to receive reasonable notice of the\nallegations being made against him, and which will ultimately determine the resolution of his case,\nso that the applicant can have a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001); Directive \u00b6\u00b6 4.3., 4.3.1., and 4.3.2.\nRegardless of how well Applicant asserted a defense against the Government\u2019s case of falsification\nbrought forth at the hearing, it would be unreasonable to assume that the lack of falsification\nallegations in the SOR had no effect upon Applicant\u2019s presentation of his case.  Thus, the Judge\u2019s\nuse of the falsification evidence as the gravamen of her adverse decision under Guideline E affected\nApplicant\u2019s due process rights under the Directive and was error.\nHowever, the Board concludes the errors contained in the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline\nE do not warrant remand.  Upon consideration of the entirety of the record evidence and the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s overall adverse security clearance decision is\nsustainable based on her analysis of Applicant\u2019s drug use under Guideline H.           \nOrder    \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is affirmed.\nSigned: Michael Y.

    "discussion": "of record evidence where Applicant stated that his use of marijuana in May 2003 was unintentional (Government Exhibits 3 and 4). However, the record contains Applicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR that he used marijuana in 2003 and his answer to a question on his security clearance questionnaire wherein he admitted to marijuana use in May 2003. In neither of these instances did Applicant qualify his answer by indicating that his May 2003 use was inadvertent. The Judge was free to evaluate Applicant\u2019s explanation concerning the circumstances surrounding his May 2003 marijuana use, but she was not compelled to accept Applicant\u2019s explanation. Although not commented upon by the Judge, the fact that the marijuana was being consumed in a Turkish pipe at a party supports, rather than detracts from, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s May 2003 marijuana use was knowing and intentional. The Judge\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that his last use of psilocybin mushrooms took place at the end of 2005 and not at the end of 2006 as the Judge found. Applicant points to the Judge\u2019s finding that he falsified a security clearance application in June or July 2006 in support of his assertion that the last use must have occurred at the end of 2005 rather than at the end of 2006, otherwise it would have been impossible for him to lie about it in mid-year 2006. A review of the record evidence convinces the Board that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant last used psilocybin mushrooms in December 2006 is sustainable. The record evidence indicates that Applicant falsified a security clearance application dated January 4, 2007. This falsification is referenced in Govt. Exhibit 2. Thus, the Judge\u2019s finding of a falsification in June or July 2006 that Applicant relies on is in error. Also, there is ample support for the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s last use of psilocybin mushrooms took place in December 2006.

Mendez, Attorney At Law\nJune 21, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on June 12, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On June 19, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\u201d\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\u201d (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \n  The Applicant responded to the SOR and it was notarized on August 21, 2009,\nwherein he requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was\nassigned to the  Administrative Judge on November 12, 2009.  A notice of hearing was\noriginally issued on December 14, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 3, 2020.\nThe matter was rescheduled and an amended notice of hearing was issued on January\n8, 2010, scheduling the hearing for March 10, 2010.  At the hearing the Government\npresented five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 to 5, which were admitted\n\n2\nwithout objection.  The Applicant presented twenty-seven exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through Z and AA.  He called four witnesses and testified on his\nown behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 22, 2010.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 33 years old and has a Master of Science in Mechanical\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Engineer and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations.  \nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under these guidelines.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  He has worked for his current employer since February\n2003.  He used marijuana about ten times between July 2001 to at least May 2003.  (Tr.\np. 89.)  He began using marijuana in college, continued to use it while living in Europe\nduring an internship, and last used it on Memorial day in May 2003.  On that day, he\nwas at a  party with friends and smoked it in a turkish pipe.  He has also purchased\nmarijuana with friends for his own use. \nThe Applicant also used psilocybin mushrooms on four separate occasions, twice\nin February 2002, and twice in December 2006.  In 2002, he used psilocybin during an\ninternship in Germany.  In 2004, the Applicant applied for a security clearance that was\ngranted sometime in 2005, with the understanding that he was no longer using illegal\ndrugs.  He knew the use of illegal drugs was against the law and prohibited by his\ncompany.  On New Years Eve, 2006, while holding a DoD security clearance, the\nApplicant used psilocybin mushrooms again, on two occasions.  He also purchased\npsilocybin mushrooms with friends for his own use.   \nIn May 2004, the Applicant provided a statement to the Department of Defense\nindicating that he had no intent of ever using illegal drugs in the future.  (Government\nExhibit 4.)  The Applicant explained that at the time he made the statement, he had no\nintent to use illegal drugs in the future.  At the hearing, he testified that he has no plan to\nuse any illegal drug in the future.  (Tr. pp. 91).  He states that it has not been easy for\nhim but he has made a lifestyle change and a deliberate attempt to reduce the\nfrequency of contact with his friends that use illegal drugs.  (Tr. pp. 115 -116).  \n\n3\nThe Applicant submitted a notarized letter of Intent wherein he states that he will\nnot repeat his past illegal drug use and understands that if he does, his security\nclearance would be subject to automatic revocation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits K and AA.)\nThe Applicant explained that after having used marijuana and psilocybin\nmushrooms, he was asked by his company to apply for a job that would require SCI\naccess.  Instead of telling the truth about his use of illegal drugs, he submitted a falsified\nsecurity clearance application in June or July 2006, and intentionally omitted his most\nrecent use of psilocybin mushrooms.  Prior to going into the polygraph exam, the\nApplicant confessed to the examiner that he had not been truthful on the application.  In\nJune 2007, the Applicant was denied program access through another Government\nagency due in part to his illegal drug use set forth above.  Since then, the Applicant has\nadmitted his illegal drug use.  (Government Exhibit 1.)\nFour witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  A System Director, two\nDepartment Directors and a Senior Project Leader from the Applicant\u2019s company\ntestified that they consider the Applicant to be a hard worker, efficient, trustworthy and\nresponsible.  He is also known to be consciousness and loyal.  They are aware of his\nmistakes and have forgiven him.  (Tr. pp. 27-78.)        \nNumerous letters of recommendation from his supervisor, professional\ncolleagues and friends of the Applicant attest to his hard working nature, superior\nperformance, high technical abilities, excellent leadership skills, good judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  He is well respected by everyone and highly\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I.)   \nThe Applicant has undergone drug tests that have all come back with negative\nresults.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)\nThe Applicant submitted the results of a psychological examination he underwent\non January 22, 2010, by a licensed Clinical Psychologist of his choice.  The results of\nthe examination indicates that the Applicant tests with a low probability of substance\nabuse and substance dependence.  There is no indication, on interview or test data,\nthat he would present a security risk.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L and M.)  \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for the periods from February 24, 2003\nthorough November 12, 2009, all reflect \u201csatisfactory\u201d ratings.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits N\nthrough T.)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n\n5\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and personal conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\n\n6\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use (Guideline H), and dishonesty (Guideline E).\nThe totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness\non the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case\nunder Guidelines H and E of the SOR.  \nThe Applicant has used marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms while working for\nhis current employer, a defense contractor, and while holding a security clearance.  He\nknew at the time that it was illegal and against company policy.  Although his most\nrecent use of any controlled substance occurred in 2006, over four years ago, he told\nthe Government in 2004, that he had no intent to use illegal drugs in the future, and\nthen broke his word.  Given his past history, there is no guarantee that he will remain\ndrug free in the future or that his word can be relied upon.  Although the probability is\nlow that he will return to drug use, the possibility exists, and poses a security risk that\ncannot be ignored.  Under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions\n25.(a) any drug abuse, and 25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I\nfind against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \n \nFurthermore, the Applicant deliberately provided false information to the\nGovernment in 2006, concerning his illegal drug use in the past.  He only confessed his\ndrug use when faced with a polygraph.  This conduct displays dishonesty and an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and shows a pattern of unreliability\nand untrustworthiness.  Under the particular facts of this case, his poor personal\nconduct is considered a significant security risk, which prohibits a favorable\ndetermination in this case.  Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying\nConditions,16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nConsequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is a 33 year old project\nengineer who has had a productive career, as evidenced by his witnesses, his favorable\nletters of recommendation and his performance appraisal.  However, he has also\ndisregarded the law, company policy and DoD regulation, revealing a defect in judgment\n\n7\nthat cannot be ignored.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct\nset forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole-person\nassessment of poor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and he clearly does\nnot meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I\nfind against the Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 4, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), on June 27, 2008.  On October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H, J and E for the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 2, 2009.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 15, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on November 20, 2009, and I\nreceived the case assignment on January 12, 2010.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing\nthat same day, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 28, 2010.  The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.\nThe Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(TR) on February 4, 2010.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nuntil March 1, 2010, to submit additional matters.  On February 26, 2010, and again on\nMarch 1, 2010, he submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, which were received without\nobjection.  The record closed on March 1, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations of\nthe SOR, with explanations.  He also provided additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.\nDrug Involvement\n1.a.~1.d.  The Applicant was involved with crack cocaine, and to a lesser extent\nmarijuana, from about 1989 until his last usage of cocaine in December of 2007. (TR at\npage 20 line 2 to page 24 line 4, and at page 42 line 10 to page 43 line 17.)  He was\nalso involved in the sale of cocaine.  (TR at page 25 line 25 to page 26 line 15.)  The\nApplicant\u2019s involvement was periodic, and his older brother, a drug abuser, was a great\ninfluence on the Applicant.  (TR at page 20 line 2 to page 24 line 4.)  In 2004, he was\ndepressed as his sister was diagnosed with cancer.  (GX 2 at page 5.)  \u201cDuring a 3-4\nweek period,\u201d he used \u201c\u2018crack cocaine\u2019 on 3-4 occasions.\u201d  (Id.)  In 2004, he also tested\npositive for cocaine.  (TR at page 24 line 23 to page 25 line 20.)\n1.e.  As a result of his drug involvement, the Applicant was arrested twice, once\nin December of 1986, and again in April of 1988.  (TR at page 28 line 9 to page 30 line\n18.)  Both arrests are cross referenced as Criminal Conduct; and as such, will be\ndiscussed at length under Paragraph 2 of the SOR.\nCriminal Conduct\n2.a.  In 1977, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently found guilty of,\ntwo counts of Robbery.  (GX 4 at page 3.)  He drove the getaway car for his brother,\nwho unbeknownst to the Applicant, had \u201crobbed a store.\u201d  (TR at page 27 line 3 to page\n28 line 8.)  As a result of his involvement, the Applicant was sentenced to six months in\njail, and was placed on probation for three years.  (TR at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line\n8, and GX 4 at page 3.)\n2.b.  In December of 1986, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently charged\nwith Possession of a Controlled Substance.  (GX 4 at page 3.).  He was in a park with a\ncouple of friends, one of whom was in the possession of drugs.  (TR at page 28 line 9 to\npage 30 line 1.)  The Applicant was unaware of this possession, but all were arrested.\n\n3\n(Id.)  The charge against the Applicant was ultimately dismissed.  (TR at page 28 line 9\nto page 30 line 1, and GX 4 at page 3.)\n2.c.  In April of 1988, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently found\nguilty of two felonies, Possession of Rock Cocaine and Possession/Purchase of\nCocaine Base for Sale.  (GX 4 at page 3.).  He was very much influenced by his older\nbrother; and as a result, although he was found guilty, he was only sentenced to attend\nNarcotics Anonymous meetings, to community service, and was placed on probation for\nthree years.  (TR at page 30 lines 2~18.)\n2.d.  In July of 1990, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently charged with\nbeing a Felon in Possession of a Gun/Firearm, and Battery on a Person.  (GX 4 at page\n3.)  The Applicant\u2019s bother, who had a key to the Applicant\u2019s apartment, secreted a\nfirearm on the premises.  (TR at page 31 lines 13~25, and at page 32 line 21 to page 34\nline 14.)  The police were called to the apartment in response to a domestic disturbance\ninvolving the Applicant and his girl friend, and found the gun.  (Id.)  The charges against\nthe Applicant were ultimately dismissed.  (TR at page 31 lines 13~25, and at page 32\nline 21 to page 34 line 14, and GX 4 at page 3.)\n2.e.  In June of 1999, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently pled guilty to\nDriving Under the Influence.  (GX 3 at page 4.)  He had consumed \u201ca few beers\u201d prior to\nthis arrest.  (TR at page 34 line 15 to page 35 line 11.)  The Applicant, in part, was\nplaced on probation for five years, fined and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous\nmeetings.  (TR at page 34 line 15 to page 35 line 11 and GX 3 at page.)\n2.f.  In October of 2003, the Applicant was arrested and charged with of Driving\nUnder the Influence (DUI).  He had consumed \u201ca couple beers . . . three to four hours\u201d\nprior to this arrest.  (TR at page 35 line 14 to page 38 line 10.)  As he was not over the\nlegal blood/alcohol limit when driving, this case was nolle prossed.  (Id.)\nPersonal Conduct\n3.a.  On Applicant\u2019s June 2008 e-QIP, Section 24a asks about \u201cUse of Illegal\nDrugs or Drug Activity . . . Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\u201d to which the\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  (GX 1 at page 30.)  He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d as \u201cit was an\nembarrassment.\u201d  (TR at page 38 line 13 to page 39 line 20.)  This is a wilful\nfalsification.\n3.b.  On Applicant\u2019s June 2008 e-QIP, Section 23a asks about \u201cYour Police\nRecord . . . Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense,\u201d to\nwhich the Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  (GX 1 at page 29, emphasis supplied.)  He\nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d as he \u201cwas under the impression that anything under three to seven\nyears, . . . [he] didn\u2019t have to list.\u201d  (TR at page 38 line 13 to page 39 line 20.)  In 1977,\nhe was charged and convicted of two counts of Robbery.  In 1988, he was charged and\nconvicted of two drug charges, both felonies.  Finally, in July of 1990, he was charged\nwith being a Felon in Possession of a Gun/Firearm.  His explanation is not believable,\n\n4\nas the language in the question is in plain English and there is no reference to a 3~7\nyear window of disclosure.  This is a wilful falsification.\n3.c.  On Applicant\u2019s June 2008 e-QIP, Section 23b asks about \u201cYour Police\nRecord . . . Have you ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives\noffense,\u201d to which the Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  (GX 1 at page 29, emphasis supplied.)\nAgain, he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d as he \u201cwas under the impression that anything under three to\nseven years, . . . [he] didn\u2019t have to list.\u201d  (TR at page 38 line 13 to page 39 line 20.  In\nJuly of 1990, he was charged with being a Felon in Possession of a Gun/Firearm.  His\nexplanation is not believable, as the language of the question is in plain English and\nthere is no reference to a 3~7 year window of disclosure.  This is a wilful falsification.\n3.d.  On Applicant\u2019s June 2008 e-QIP, Section 23d asks about \u201cYour Police\nRecord . . . Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs,\u201d to which the Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  (GX 1 at page 30, emphasis\nsupplied.)  He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d as he \u201cwas under the impression that anything under\nthree to seven years, . . . [he] didn\u2019t have to list.\u201d  (TR at page 38 line 13 to page 39 line\n20.  In December of 1986, he was charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance.\nIn 1988, he was charged and convicted of two drug charges.  Finally, in June of 1999\nand again in October of 2003, he was charged with DUIs.  His explanation is not\nbelievable, as the language of the question is in plain English and there is no reference\nto a 3~7 year window of disclosure.  This is a wilful falsification.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nParagraph 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline also notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nUnder Subparagraph 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.  In addition, \u201dillegal\ndrug possession, including . . . sale\u201d under Subparagraph 25(c) may also be\ndisqualifying.  Here, the Applicant used crack cocaine, and to a lesser extent marijuana,\nfrom about 1989 until his last usage of cocaine in December of 2007.  I find no\ncountervailing mitigating condition that is applicable, as the Applicant last used cocaine\nonly two years prior to his hearing.\n\n6\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Criminal Conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Paragraph 31(a) provides that \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,@ may raise security concerns.  As the Government does not allege the drug\ninvolvement or the wilful falsifications as Criminal Conduct, the Applicant\u2019s last culpable\nact of Criminal Conduct was in June of 1999, when he was charged with and convicted\nof a DUI, more than 10 years ago.  However, the first countervailing mitigation is not\napplicable, for although \u201cmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior,\u201d it is likely\n\u201cto recur,\u201d and does \u201ccast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  Since 1999, the Applicant has abused drugs, and has repeatedly falsified\nhis June 2008 e-QIP.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom an personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . . .\u201d  Here, the Applicant\nfalsified his answers to Sections 23 and 24 on his June 2008 e-QIP.  No mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.\n\n7\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant has the unqualified support\nof his colleagues, his sister, and his pastor.  (AppXs A and B.)  However, the record\nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a security clearance.  He was clearly less than candid with the Government on his e-\nQIP.  Furthermore, his past Drug Involvement and Criminal Conduct is fairly extensive.\nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an undated \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 17, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nAugust 7, 2009, and reassigned to me on October 13, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nApril 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing on November 9, 2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nDecember 8, 2009. After an amendment to the SOR, as discussed below, I granted a \ncontinuance of the case until January 28, 2010. That hearing was conducted by video \nteleconference (VTC). DOHA received the transcript of the first hearing (Tr.1) on \nDecember 15, 2009, and the transcript of the second hearing (Tr.2) on February 3, \n2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nEvidence \n \n \nAt the first hearing on December 8, 2009, the Government offered Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 10, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were admitted without objection. \n \nAt the second hearing on January 28, 2010, the Government offered GE 11, \nwhich was received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called a \nwitness,1 and submitted AE G through R, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nThe record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information. \nApplicant submitted AE S through SS, which were admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding two allegations under \nGuideline F, as follows: \n \n1.f. As of December 8, 2009, you had not filed your federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2007. \n \n1.g. As of December 8, 2009, you had not filed your federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2008. \n \nApplicant did not object to the amendment, and it was granted. A continuance \nwas granted to permit Applicant to respond to the amendment. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since May 2006. \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s witness was driving from another state and was not present when the hearing \nstarted. She was still a substantial distance away when it was time for her to testify. She pulled over to \nthe side of the road, and her testimony was taken telephonically. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nHe has a Master\u2019s degree, awarded in 1993. He is married with two children, ages eight \nand seven.2  \n \n \nBefore he accepted his current job, Applicant was self-employed, working in the \nareas of property management and software development. He also worked as a \nsoftware developer for two corporations between 1993 and 2001, and 2004 to 2005. \nApplicant and his wife purchased their home in state A for about $190,000 in 1995. He \nlater took out a second mortgage/home equity loan on the property for about $50,000, \nwhich he used for his business. It appears he may have also refinanced his first \nmortgage at some point. Applicant accepted his current job in state B in May 2006. At \nthat point, the balances on his primary and secondary mortgages were about $169,000 \nand $42,600. Applicant placed the house on the market, asking about $200,000, but the \nhouse did not sell. After several months without a buyer, the house was rented in \nNovember 2006. The tenant paid the rent for about a year and then stopped paying. \nApplicant stopped paying the mortgages in October 2008. Applicant placed the house \nback on the market but was unable to sell it. He made the decision that it was not \nfinancially wise to keep paying the mortgages, and he permitted the house to go to \nforeclosure. The tenant was finally evicted in March 2009.3  \n \n \nApplicant and the mortgagor worked out a \u201cshort sale\u201d of the house. His \ndocuments indicated the house sale was scheduled to close on March 10, 2010. The \npurchase price of the house was $150,000. The first and second mortgages were held \nby the same financial institution. After closing costs, the mortgagor was scheduled to \nreceive $136,953 from the sale. That would leave a deficiency of about $25,000 on the \nfirst mortgage. Under the terms of a short sale, the mortgagor agrees to accept a sale \nprice less than the amount of the mortgage and release the homeowner from liability for \nthe deficiency. Applicant testified that he believed the short sale covered both the first \nand second mortgage. The short sale documents do not specifically state that both \nmortgages are covered. However, the sale could not proceed without the approval of \nthe lienholder of the second mortgage. The mortgagor had apparently given up hope of \ncollecting the second mortgage because a credit report obtained on January 21, 2010, \nshowed the second mortgage as \u201ccharged off.\u201d The balance of the second mortgage is \nlisted at $43,000.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also has a Master\u2019s degree. She works and their combined \nincome is substantial. They rented a home in state B for several months after they \nmoved there. They then purchased a new home in July 2006. Applicant obtained a first \nmortgage on the property for $200,000 and a second mortgage for $50,000. There is no \nindication of any payment issues on these mortgages.5  \n \n                                                          \n2 Tr.1 at 42, 69-70; GE 1; AE S. \n \n3 Tr.1 at 20-27, 41-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE S. \n \n4 Tr.1 at 27-28; Tr.2 at 18-22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11; AE B, G, H, S, PP. \n \n5 Tr.1 at 29, 40-43; AE S, EE. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant bought an investment property from a builder in state B for $600,000 in \nJune 2007. The sale was financed with a 30-year $600,000 mortgage, with monthly \npayments of $5,713. The house was appraised at $700,000, and Applicant thought he \ncould sell or \u201cflip\u201d the house in a short period for $650,000 to $700,000. Throughout the \nhearing, Applicant stated that he believed he had $100,000 in equity in the property \nbecause they purchased it at less than the appraised value. The housing market quickly \ncollapsed. He lowered the asking price to about $590,000, but was unable to sell the \nhouse. He stopped paying the mortgage in about November 2007, and let the home go \ninto foreclosure.6  \n \n \nApplicant stated that the decisions to stop paying his mortgages were difficult \nones. He stated \u201c[t]hey were simply losing too much value to attempt to salvage at their \ncurrent loan rate.\u201d Regarding the house in state A, he testified that \u201cit really didn\u2019t make \nfinancial sense to work with the property any more because of the large amount that we \nneeded up front and the fact that the property was under the value that was required.\u201d7 \nWhen he responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2009, he wrote: \n \nI am still in the process of deciding if this property is worth retaining. With \nthis current economy it is not prudent to invest money into a property that \nis losing value.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgagor issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1099-A \n(Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property) for tax year 2008. The form indicated \nthat the lender acquired the property on May 1, 2008. The balance of the principal on \nthe mortgage at that time was listed as $600,899, and the fair market value of the \nproperty was listed at $293,894. Applicant testified that the house was actually sold and \n$293,894 was the sales price. Applicant was asked at the first hearing about the tax \nconsequences of the 1099-A form. He stated that he had not yet filed his 2007 and \n2008 tax returns.9  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s accountant testified at the second hearing. She stated the 2007 and \n2008 tax returns had been prepared and were in the process of being submitted. \nApplicant submitted proof after the hearing that the returns had been filed. The returns \nindicate that Applicant can expect refunds of about $26,000 for tax year 2007, and \n$13,000 for tax year 2008. The accountant testified about the 1099-A form. She \nindicated that form did not impose any tax consequences, as it merely notifies the \ntaxpayer and the IRS of the fair market value of the property. There are no tax \nconsequences because it does not affect the underlying debt, which the \ntaxpayer/Applicant still owes. If, as Applicant testified, the property sold for $293,894, \nhis indebtedness on the mortgage is about $307,000. The mortgagor can attempt to \n                                                          \n6 Tr.1 at 28-36, 46-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE S. \n \n7 Tr.1 at 27, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6; AE S, EE. \n \n8 GE 5. \n \n9 Tr.1 at 36-37, 50-57; AE C, S. \n \n\n \n5 \n \ncollect the debt, or it can issue an IRS form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt). If the \nmortgagor forgives the debt and issues a 1099-C, then there are potential tax \nconsequences. Tax liability depends upon whether the taxpayer is insolvent, as \ndetermined by an IRS formula. Applicant\u2019s accountant prepared an insolvency \nworksheet. The worksheet is not yet applicable, as the mortgagor has not issued a \n1099-C. Applicant stated that the worksheet indicates that there will be no tax liability if \na 1099-C is issued.10 \n \n \nApplicant bought another investment property in state B in October 2007. That \nwas four months after he put the first investment property on the market, and a month \nbefore he stopped paying the mortgage on the first property. The property was a four-\nunit building that he bought for $400,000. He intended to sell the property at a profit. He \nwas unable to sell the property and started leasing the units in April 2008. He stated that \nhis property manager stole the tenants\u2019 rent and did not forward the rent payments. \nApplicant stopped paying the mortgage in February 2009, and it went into foreclosure in \nMay 2009.11  \n \n \nIn addition to the delinquent mortgages, the SOR alleged two other delinquent \ndebts. The $44 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was an association fee on the property in \nstate A, which was supposed to be paid by Applicant\u2019s tenant. Applicant paid that debt \nin July 2009. Applicant\u2019s tenant in state A made improvements to the property without \nApplicant\u2019s permission, and then did not pay the contractor. A $1,300 mechanic\u2019s lien \nwas placed on the property. That debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant settled this \ndebt in January 2009, and the lien was released.12 \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant self-reported the foreclosure of his first investment \nproperty and the mechanic\u2019s lien on his house in state A to his security manager. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. Other than his unpaid mortgages, \nApplicant\u2019s finances are sound. His 2007 tax return showed he and his wife earned \n$170,598. They reported $177,571 in income on their 2008 tax return. Applicant stated \nthey currently both earn \u201csix-figure\u201d salaries. His insolvency worksheet reported \n$150,000 in retirement accounts and $25,309 in cash and bank accounts. He has about \n$2,000 per month in discretionary income. He has loans against his retirement \naccounts. He indicated that he planned on using his income tax refunds to pay off his \nretirement account loans, which would increase his monthly discretionary income to \nabout $4,000. He stated that the mortgagors have taken no steps to attempt to collect \nthe deficiencies owed on his foreclosed properties. If the mortgagors attempt to enforce \ntheir debts, he will retain an attorney and negotiate a settlement or otherwise resolve \nthe debts. He has the resources to address the debts if that occurs. He and his wife \n                                                          \n10 Tr.2 at 14-16, 22-23, 27-45; AE K, L-R, W, X, Y, FF-HH, QQ, RR. \n \n11 Tr.1 at 61-67; AE S. The foreclosure of the second investment property was not alleged in the \nSOR. It will not be used for disqualification purposes. It will be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall \nfinancial situation; in the application of mitigating conditions; and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n12 Tr.1 at 20, 25, 38, 48-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6, 8, 9; AE A, D-F. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nhave ended their investments in real estate and do not plan on entering that market \nagain. Applicant submitted information establishing that he is a valued employee.13  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n                                                          \n13 Tr.1 at 37-39, 48, 70; Tr.2 at 23-24, 46, 64-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE T, U, W, \nX, EE, GG, II, JJ. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. He did not timely file his 2007 and 2008 federal \nincome tax returns. The evidence is sufficient to raise all the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n8 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \napplicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g.  \n \n \nApplicant still owes more than $300,000 for deficiencies on foreclosed \nmortgages. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable to \nhis unpaid debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the downturn in the real estate \nmarket. He also had a tenant who did not pay the rent and a property manager that \nstole from him. Those events were outside Applicant\u2019s control. His decision to invest in \nthe real estate market was completely within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that \nthe individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant and his wife have \ngood jobs and earn substantial salaries. He has about $25,000 in cash and bank \naccounts and $150,000 in retirement accounts. He could have afforded to pay the \nmortgages on the state A house if he chose to do so. He decided not to, stating it was \n\u201cnot prudent to invest money into a property that is losing value.\u201d His ability to pay the \nmortgages on the state A home was further hampered by the poor business decision to \ninvest in real estate properties. He bought the investment property in July 2007, \nknowing that he had recently been forced to rent the state A house because he was \nunable to sell it. He thought he could \u201cflip\u201d the house and make a quick profit. That \nhouse was on the market four months when he bought another investment property in \nOctober 2007. That was just one month before he stopped paying the mortgage on the \nfirst investment property. I do not find that Applicant acted responsibly by buying \ninvestment properties while he was unable to sell his first house. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable. \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. His mortgagor agreed to a short \nsale of the state A house. That ends his legal liability for the primary mortgage. His legal \nliability for the second mortgage/home equity loan is less clear, although it appears the \nmortgagor agreed to the sale and listed the loan as \u201ccharged off.\u201d There are indications \nthat the state A mortgages are resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable to the primary \nmortgage on the state A house, and that debt is mitigated. The secondary mortgage is \nmore problematic, even if the debt is no longer legally enforceable because of the short \nsale. Applicant did not benefit financially from the primary mortgage and the mortgage \non the investment property. However, he received $50,000 from the second \nmortgage/home equity loan, which he used for his own purposes. He has the financial \nmeans to pay that debt, but chose not to because it would not be \u201cprudent.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c) \nis partially applicable to the secondary mortgage.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant owes about $307,000 on the deficiency for the investment property\u2019s \nmortgage. Applicant states it is unlikely the mortgagor will proceed against him. That \nmay be so, but it does not constitute a resolution of that problem. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \napplicable to the deficiency owed on the investment property\u2019s mortgage. Applicant\u2019s \nactions do not qualify as a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his \nmortgages.14 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to his unpaid mortgages.  \n \n \nApplicant paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable \nto those debts.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that financial concerns are still present despite some \nmitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \n                                                          \n14 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n10 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive work record and his overall financial situation. Applicant\u2019s finances \nwould be in great shape if he did not have real estate issues. He and his wife have large \nsalaries, and he has substantial savings and retirement accounts. However, he made \nrisky investments and incurred large losses. In reality, the mortgagors incurred large \nlosses, because Applicant has not paid them. He took $50,000 in equity out of his home \nin state A and used that money for his business. Despite the ability to pay that debt, he \nchose not to pay it. He currently owes more than $300,000 on the mortgage for his \nforeclosed investment property. He has taken no action on that debt, other than to \nassume the mortgagor will not attempt to enforce it. Applicant\u2019s finances continue to \nraise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: \nDarrell C. Menthe, Esquire\nMcGuire Woods LLP\nApril 12, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on August 26, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \n\n2\nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 28, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 10, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 11, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 1, 2009; and August 3, 2009. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on September 9, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\ncalled three additional witnesses, and submitted no exhibits at the hearing. Applicant\nrequested that the record remain open for a period of time to allow for the receipt of\nadditional documentation. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibit A on September 15,\n2009, which was received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing, and the record closed, on September 21, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 31, married with one child, and has a post-graduate degree. He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry. Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\nahead of the United States. \nThe Applicant is a native-born American citizen. During his college days, he\nstudied abroad in Europe. While in Europe during the 1998-99 school year, he met his\nfuture wife. She is a citizen of France and is a licensed professional there. After their\nmarriage in 2001, Applicant and his wife returned to the United States so that he could\nattend graduate school. (Transcript at 20-22.)\nThe Applicant attended graduate school from 2001 to 2007. During that time, his\nwife was attempting to obtain a license in their state of residence to practice her\nprofession. In order to obtain her license, the Applicant\u2019s wife had to take several\nexaminations over a period of years. She successfully passed the examinations, and\nreceived her license in 2007. She began practicing her profession in January 2008.\n(Transcript at 23-25, 49, 67-70.)\nIn 2005, the Applicant made the decision to become a citizen of France. He did\nthis because of the uncertainty over whether his wife could pass her examinations. They\nthought a return to Europe might be necessary for her to work in her profession, though\nneither one of them desired to leave the United States. He also believed that obtaining\n\n3\nFrench citizenship would make him more marketable in the European Community after\nhe obtained his graduate degree. Applicant had no intention of renouncing his American\ncitizenship. (Transcript at 25-26, 33-34, 56-58, 71-72.) Applicant repeatedly stated that\nhe was willing to renounce his French citizenship, since he has no emotional connection\nto that country. (Transcript at 44-46, 53-54, 60-62.)\nAfter becoming a French citizen, the Applicant received a French passport, and\nalso voted in a French presidential election. (Transcript at 27-29.) Applicant used the\npassport to travel to Europe in 2006. (Transcript at 29-30, 41-43.) He also attended\nseveral events at the home of the French Consul-General in the city where he lives. The\nlast event occurred in 2006. (Transcript at 31-32, 49-51, 74-75.)\nApplicant received his advanced degree in 2007. (Government Exhibit 1 at\nSection 10.) The Applicant engaged in all the above actions before he began working in\nthe defense industry in August 2008.\nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement in September 2008. At that point he was made aware of the Government\u2019s\nconcerns regarding his dual citizenship and possession of a foreign passport.\n(Government Exhibit 2.) His French passport was destroyed by his employer\u2019s Assistant\nFacility Security Officer on November 26, 2008. (Government Exhibit 3; Transcript at\n27.)\nApplicant submitted his American passport, which shows transit stamps from a\n2007 trip to France. This is after he received his French passport and before he began\nwork in the defense industry. (Applicant Exhibit A; Transcript at 54-55.)\nMitigation\nA close friend of the Applicant testified for him. This person is employed in the\ndefense industry for a different company and has a security clearance. He has known\nthe Applicant for ten years. The witness testified that he attempted to recruit the\nApplicant to work for his employer because of his confidence in the Applicant\u2019s abilities\nand intelligence. He further states that Applicant \u201cis one of the most trustworthy people I\nknow.\u201d (Transcript at 90-104.)\nThe president of the Applicant\u2019s employer also testified. He is one of the founders\nof the company, which has about 30 employees. The small number of employees allows\nthe witness to observe and evaluate the Applicant. He finds the Applicant to be\ntrustworthy and recommends that he receive his security clearance. (Transcript at 104-\n117.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\n\n5\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. The\napplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant is a dual citizen of France and the United States, and that he\nhad a valid French passport.\nApplicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns about his possible dual\ncitizenship with France, and his possession of French passport after becoming an\nAmerican citizen.  The concern is stated thus under this Guideline, When an individual\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United\nStates, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\nApplicant obtained a valid French passport after becoming an American citizen,\nand also voted in a French national election.  Accordingly, Disqualifying Condition 10\napplies to the facts of this case: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include: (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport; (7) voting in a foreign election. \nApplicant obtained French citizenship even though he is a native-born American\ncitizen. Disqualifying Condition 10(b) applies: action to acquire or obtain recognition of a\nforeign citizenship by an American citizen.\nAs shown above, Applicant made the decision to obtain French citizenship before\nhe began work in the defense industry. He did it primarily to help his wife, when she was\nhaving difficulty obtaining her professional license in the United States. As stated above,\nshe passed her exams and received a license in 2007. Once he began working in the\ndefense industry in 2008, the reason for having the foreign citizenship evaporated.\nMitigating Condition 11(b) states it is mitigating where: the individual has expressed a\n\n6\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship. Applicant has repeatedly and credibly testified\nthat he is willing to renounce his French citizenship. I find that this Mitigating Condition\napplies. \nThe Applicant\u2019s French passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated as required by Mitigating Condition\n11(e).  Guideline C is found for the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. My Guideline C analysis is\napplicable to the whole-person analysis as well. The evidence shows that the Applicant\nis a patriotic American citizen. His decision to obtain French citizenship was made\nbefore he began working in the defense industry, and also before his wife was allowed\nto practice her profession here. I find that his contacts with the French community have\nno security significance. The Applicant eloquently testified about the importance of his\nfamily in the United States, and his pride in being an American citizen and a member of\nthe defense industry. He is knowledgeable about security and understands his\nresponsibility. I find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). Using the whole person standard, the Applicant\nhas mitigated the security significance of his alleged foreign preference and is eligible\nfor a security clearance. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His social security account\nstatement confirms this assertion. The business failed in 2003 (AE) E. Applicant lost a\ngreat deal of money. His earnings in 2003 were $856. Applicant worked as a sales\nrepresentative when the business failed. He worked on commission and did not receive\nvery much money. The paychecks would fluctuate. Applicant had part-time work in\n2004-2005. He has worked for his current employer since September 2005, earning\nless than $30,000 a year (Tr. 66).\nApplicant\u2019s mother died in 2006 (Tr. 68). The family home, valued at\napproximately $500,000, is for sale (AE) C. Applicant\u2019s share of the inheritance from\nthe home will be approximately $67,000 (Tr. 72). The house was under contract in\n2008, but the sale did not go through (AE) D. Given the current economic climate this is\nunderstandable. The home will sell and Applicant plans to use the money to finish\npaying his delinquent debts. He presented credibly on this issue and had\ndocumentation from his lawyer concerning the property.\nApplicant has paid as many small debts as possible since 2005 when he\nbecame employed on a full time basis (Tr. 77). He contacted other creditors and they\nwould not cooperate with him on settlements. His recent credit report notes several\naccounts that are \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d. He did not want to file for bankruptcy as a solution. \nAt issue are the following debts totaling approximately $31,000, as noted in the\nMay 5, 2009 SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e.\n\n3\n1.a \u2013 VEHICLE ($23,009) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this account represents a\nvoluntary repossession that occurred in 2004 because he could no longer maintain the\nmonthly payment. He contacted the dealership and learned the balance is now\n$17,000. His intent is to settle this account as soon as he is able (Tr. 20). He believes\nhe will make a settlement offer and liquidate the debt for less than $17,000.\n1.b \u2013 Credit Card ($5,747) \u2013 SETTLED \u2013 Applicant denied this account because he\nsettled it for $2,269. He has been making monthly payments. He will make his last\npayment of $383 in August 2009 (AE) B).\n1.c \u2013 Credit Card ($2,006) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admits this allegation. This is a\naccount that was opened in 2002. Applicant used this account when he was self-\nemployed (Tr. 58). \n1.d \u2013 Credit Debt ($5,061) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant admitted this allegation. \n1.e. \u2013 DEBT ($6,940) SETTLED.-- Applicant denied this account because he has been\nin repayment status for 18 months (AE) A. He made an initial payment of $2,500. His\nmonthly payments are $301.78. He defaulted in 2000 due to his unemployment. His\nbalance is approximately $5,432 (Tr. 41).\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income from his employment is approximately $1,634.\nHis veteran\u2019s disability pension is $1,429 a month. After expenses and debt repayment,\nApplicant has approximately $356 net remainder. His wife is currently employed. He will\nreceive a military pension next year at the age of 60 (Tr. 38). He has a 401(k) worth\napproximately $7,000. He is current on his monthly bills.   \nApplicant works within his church community. He accepts positions of leadership\nand is creative. He is a proven asset in the community. Applicant is a very responsible\nmember of the church. He exemplifies a man of integrity and character (AE) G.\nApplicant serves on the church finance team. He is generous with his time and mentors\ndisadvantaged church members. His deacon recommends him highly (AE) G.\nApplicant is rated as an exceptional employee. He is articulate and very thorough\nin his work. He is a problem solver and a team player. He is a loyal associate who is\nvery trustworthy (AE) F. Applicant is extremely knowledgeable and well versed on policy\nand procedure. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor describes him as meticulous, professional, and committed\nto the mission. He received an award for his outstanding contribution to the company in\n2009. His performance consistently exceeds expectations. Applicant received\nrecognition as a team leader for his leadership skills in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (AE) F.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n\n4\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\n\n5\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt over a period of\ntime after his retirement from the military. He admitted the delinquent accounts alleged\nin the SOR. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Most of Applicant=s debts became delinquent around the time of his 2001\ntransition to the civilian world. He had no real income in 2001 or 2002. His business\nfailed in 2003. He no longer has the business and has no intent to have another one.\nWhile he has some lingering debt, his efforts to repay and his current status on monthly\nbills does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Consequently,\nthis mitigating condition applies.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Inasmuch as the\nmajority of debts at issue became delinquent during Applicant\u2019s transition from military\nlife to civilian or shortly thereafter, this mitigating condition applies and is a factor for\nconsideration. Applicant\u2019s business failed in 2003. He paid the bills that he could\nshowing a good-faith effort to honor his obligations. He has a track record of paying his\nbills, albeit at a slower pace than he would like. He has not shirked his responsibility.\nGiven his low income, he has acted reasonably in paying the accounts that he could\n\n6\nmanage. His family home will sell and his demeanor and presentation were credible\nconcerning this issue. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has paid many small bills since\n2005, when he started to earn a steady, but low income. He contacted creditors and\ntried to negotiate settlements. He is paying on two of the debts listed in the SOR. One\nis now paid. He provided documentation at the hearing to substantiate his claims. He\nhas paid almost 40% of his delinquent debt. Therefore, AG & 20(d), Athe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@\napplies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nThe evidence in support of granting a position of public trust to applicant under\nthe whole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial.  In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\nan honorable man who served his country for 30 years. He had a top secret clearance\nduring his military career without incident. He is an excellent employee who has\ngarnered many commendations. He accepts responsibility for his financial situation. His\ntransition from military to civilian life was difficult. He experienced low paying jobs and a\nfailed business venture. He did not ignore his debts.  Most significantly, he has taken\naffirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debts that had initially raised \nconcerns. His plan to use the proceeds from his family home was delayed due to the\neconomic downturn. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2013it\nis whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a public\n\n7\ntrust position. While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise concern\nabout a trustworthiness determination.\nOverall, the record evidence does not leave me with questions or doubts with\nregard to Applicant\u2019s financial condition. As noted above, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will\nbe resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Consequently, I conclude Applicant met his\nburden and mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his finances. Access is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n_____________________________\nNOREEN A LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and she denied falsifying her SF 85P as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since September 2006. Her SF 85P indicates that she has been continuously employed since September 1999. She married in June 1970 and has two children, ages 11 and 8. She has never been cleared for a public trust position. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22a on her SF 85P, asking if she had filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a judgment rendered against her for a debt during the last seven years.

Eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) on \nSeptember 15, 2008. On June 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary \ndecision to deny her application, citing security concerns under Guideline F and E. \nDOHA acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nMarch 31, 2010\n\n 2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 19, 2009, answered it on August 20, 2009, \nand requested a hearing. On October 9, 2009, she withdrew her request for a hearing \nand requested a determination on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on December 29, 2009. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant on the same day, and she \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on January 7, 2010, but \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on March 19, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g and 1.i-1.m and offered explanations. She denied owing the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and she denied falsifying her SF 85P as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.b. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since September 2006. Her SF 85P indicates that she has been \ncontinuously employed since September 1999. She married in June 1970 and has two \nchildren, ages 11 and 8. She has never been cleared for a public trust position.  \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22a on her SF 85P, asking if she had filed \nfor bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a judgment \nrendered against her for a debt during the last seven years. She also answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 22b, asking if she was then more than 180 days delinquent on any loan or \nfinancial obligation. (Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at 7.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) dated September 16, 2008, reflected an \nunsatisfied judgment for $1,515 entered against her in February 2003. (GX 8 at 3). The \nunsatisfied judgment is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied falsifying her SF 85P and stated that she had forgotten about the unsatisfied \njudgment.  \n \nThe same CBR reflected the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.e-\n1.m. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g had all been delinquent for more than three \nyears when Applicant submitted her SF 85P. The total of the 13 delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR is about $18,295. Three are for less than $100 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.k), and three are for less than $200 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.j). \n \n \nIn an affidavit executed on March 15, 2005, Applicant commented specifically on \nthe judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. She attributed her financial problems to her \nhusband\u2019s unemployment in 2001, her unemployment in 1998, and the burden of \nrepaying student loans. (GX 6 at 1-2.) In a statement to a security investigator on \nOctober 9, 2008, Applicant stated that her student loans had been consolidated and \nwere in good standing. (GX 5 at 3). In response to DOHA interrogatories on March 5, \n2009, Applicant stated she was currently on a medical leave of absence, and she stated \n\n 3\nshe would take care of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.g, and 1.j-1.l after she \nreturned from medical leave. (GX 5 at 6-9.) She did not state when she expected to \nreturn to work. She has not submitted evidence showing resolution of any of the debts. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she disputed the medical debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h, stating she was unaware of it. She has submitted no evidence of efforts to contact \nthe creditor or to have the data removed from her credit report. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction an evaluation of the whole \nperson. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security. The government \nmust present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate \nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n\n 4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $18,295. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the alleged delinquent debts except the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which she denies, is established by her \nCBR. Her admissions and her CBR are sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in \nAG & 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG & 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations), shifting the burden to her to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, unresolved, and did not occur \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns also may be mitigated if Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ AG & \n20(b). Applicant and her husband both experienced periods of unemployment, but her \nunemployment was in 1998 and her husband\u2019s was in 2001. She has been employed \ncontinuously since 1999 and worked for her current employer since September 2006, \nbut she has not resolved any of her delinquent debts, even though half of them are for \nless than $200. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received \nfinancial counseling and her financial problems are not under control. \n \n\n 5\n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition \nis not established because Applicant has taken virtually no action to resolve her \nindebtedness. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h in her answer to the SOR, but she presented \nno documentary evidence of actions to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her SF 85P by intentionally failing to disclose \nthe judgment entered against her in February 2003 and numerous debts that were \nmore than 180 days delinquent. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 \nas follows:  \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant was questioned about her delinquent debts in March 2005, she \nwas specifically questioned about the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. In her answer to \nthe SOR, she claimed she had forgotten about it when she submitted her SF 85P. \nAlthough my ability to judge her credibility is limited because she withdrew her request \nfor a hearing, I find her explanation for not disclosing the judgment implausible and \nunconvincing on its face. When she responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2009, \nshe was able to provide details about several of the debts that were more than 180 days \n\n 6\ndelinquent when she submitted her SF 85P, but she has offered no explanation for not \ndisclosing any of them on her SF 85P. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security \nclearance application may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established \nbecause Applicant made no effort to correct her omissions before she was confronted \nwith the evidence. No other enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are \napplicable.   \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for an \nassignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some \nwarrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, but she has had financial problems for many years \nand has done little to resolve them. She withdrew her request for a hearing, limiting my \nability to assess her sincerity and credibility. She presented no evidence of the quality of \nher work or her reputation among her supervisors and peers.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her eligibility \nfor assignment to a public trust position.  \n \n\n 7\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

He recently offered\nto pay $56,000 to compromise the $86,000 liability that has been determined to be his tax\ndebt to the Government. Applicant has funds available to pay the entire balance owed if\nthe Government refuses to accept his future offers to compromise. In 2002, Applicant\nsought Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection during the course of a contentious divorce. He\npaid all listed creditors one hundred percent of what he owed them. Clearance is granted.\nOn April 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 10, 2010. He\nadmitted both SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 8, 2010\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on July 13, 2010. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 23, 2010, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2010. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-8 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AE) 1-14 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on\nAugust 30, 2010.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 62-year-old man who has worked as a contract administrator for a\nfederal contractor since 1983. Applicant obtained a juris doctorate degree in 1983, and he\nbegan simultaneous self-employment as an attorney in 1992. He possessed a top secret\nsecurity clearance  while he served on active duty in the U. S. Air Force from 1969-72. He\nhas held a secret security clearance since either 1982 or 1983. No prior action has ever\nbeen taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance for adverse reasons. \nApplicant has been married since August 2002. He was previously married from\nJune 1968 until that marriage ended in divorce in September 1978; from November 1978\nuntil that marriage ended in divorce in March 1983; and from May 1992 until that marriage\nended in divorce in December 2000. Applicant has one adult child. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues, as alleged in the SOR, resulted from the dissolution of\nhis third marriage. His third wife was responsible for the family and law practice financial\naffairs, including filing tax returns. As the marriage apparently began to deteriorate, she\nbegan to appropriate monies to herself and to make numerous of allegations of\nwrongdoing on the part of Applicant, including to his federal employer and the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS).\nApplicant\u2019s third wife submitted fraudulent pleadings in the course of their divorce\nthat caused the court to enter an order providing for the sale of Applicant\u2019s residence. In\nresponse, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to effectively stay the\ndivorce court order while he simultaneously filed a petition in the state court to quiet title\non his residence. The quiet title action was decided in his favor and he paid all creditors\nhe had listed in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case one hundred percent of what he owed\nthem.\nApplicant has been involved in on-going disputes with the IRS for income taxes he\nowe as a result of his law practice. He has been audited for multiple tax years and he has\nsought relief through the tax courts. His liability for unpaid income taxes has been\ndetermined to be about $86,000 due to the disallowance of deductions he took based on\nhis law practice which the IRS determined was a hobby rather than a business. Applicant\ndoes not dispute that as a result of the tax court decision he is indebted to the\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at 2.\n6\n3\n3Government. However, he has continued to engage in a dialogue with the IRS in an effort\nto convince them, consistent with various claims that he has made under tax laws and\nregulations, to accept a negotiated settlement for less than the full amount due. \nOn June 2, 2010, the IRS Revenue Officer Applicant has been corresponding with\nnotified him that she was proposing to recommend rejection of his $56,000 offer in\ncompromise to settle the tax debt. She also notified him he could submit additional\ninformation if he so desired as long as it was received by July 19, 2010. Applicant\nresponded to that notice on July 14, 2010. On August 2, 2010, the IRS Revenue Officer\nresponded to Applicant\u2019s July 14, 2010 letter, and notified him that she was again\nrecommending rejection of his offer and that if her recommendation was approved that he\nwould receive a letter advising him that the offer had been rejected and explaining his\nappeal rights. Applicant has about $105,000 available in a 401(k) that he intends to apply\nto use to satisfy the tax liability when all his avenues seeking compromise have been\nexhausted. \n  \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial decision based upon relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6\nof the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or\nagainst clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline F\n(financial considerations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n5\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n6\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id. at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant sought Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2002 during a contentious\ndivorce as a legal means of protecting his residence from loss due to a court order his wife\nobtained through fraud. He thereafter defeated her effort to obtain the residence through\na quiet title action, and he paid all the creditors he had listed in the bankruptcy one\nhundred percent of what he owed them. \nApplicant has been engaged for years in legal wranglings with the IRS over the\nincome tax liability he accrued as the result of his law practice. He has gone through a\nnumber of audits and he sought relief through the tax court. His liability has been\ndetermined to be approximately $86,000. He recently offered $56,000 in compromise of\nthat liability, which offer apparently will be rejected by the IRS. Whatever the ultimate\noutcome of his dispute with the IRS, Applicant has the ability and the intent to pay either\nthe full amount owed or such lesser sum as the IRS agrees to accept in compromise. \nApplicant has never displayed an inability or unwillingness to pay his debts. Rather,\nhe has used the legal means available to him in efforts to protect his property from a\nvindictive wife and to reduce the liability that the Government has determined he owes from\ndisallowed deductions from his law practice. No disqualifying condition applies.    \n\n5\nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole-person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his\nultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which are ongoing. His\nindebtedness includes $21,000 owed to a state child-support enforcement agency and\nmore than $10,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS for multiple tax years. He did not\npresent sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history\nof financial problems. He did not give deliberately false answers to questions about his\nfinancial record in 2008, when he completed a security clearance application.\nAccordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJanuary 14, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Appellate Exhibit I. \n2\n Exhibits T\u2013Y. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on December 4,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it sets forth the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.\nThe SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to\ndecide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned\n2\nto a judge on July 2, 2010. The case was reassigned to me September 7, 2010. The\nhearing took place September 14, 2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received\nSeptember 28, 2010. \nThe record was kept open until September 30, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary information. Applicant made a timely submission and those\nmatters are admitted without objections.3\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His educational\nbackground includes a bachelor\u2019s degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. He\nmarried his second wife in 2007. He has five children, four daughters and one son,\nranging in age from 22 to 2. His two-year-old daughter is by his second wife, while the\nother children are from other relationships excluding his first marriage. Applicant was\ncourt ordered to pay child support for his oldest child (now an adult), but has otherwise\nnot been subject to child-support orders. He does provide financial support to his other\nchildren on an informal, periodic basis. \nApplicant is seeking a security clearance for the first time for his employment as\na warehouse systems analyst for a federal contractor. He has worked for this federal\ncontractor since September 2008, and he has a good employment record there as\nshown by a highly favorable letter of recommendation, a good performance evaluation,\n\n Exhibits A, K, and L. \n4\n Tr. 121\u2013122. \n5\n Exhibit R and S. \n6\n As Thoreau said, \u201cOur life is frittered away by detail  . . .  Simplify, simplify, simplify!\u201d\n7\n3\nand various certificates.  He was unemployed for about a two-month period in 2008, but\n4\nhas otherwise been continuously employed by various employers since at least 2001.   \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $40,000. His wife has been unemployed since\nabout June 2008, but she receives unemployment compensation. He has no other\nsources of income.  As of September 2010, Applicant had about $1,100 in checking and\n5\nsavings accounts.  He has no other financial accounts.\n6\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which are ongoing. In\naddition to back taxes owed to the IRS, the SOR alleges nine delinquent debts ranging\nfrom a $54 unpaid judgment to a $51,523 delinquent mortgage loan. The following table\nsummarizes  the status of the nine delinquent debts alleged in the SOR:\n7\nDelinquent Debt\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013unpaid judgment entered in\n2002 for $54 stemming from an\napartment lease. \nUnresolved.

(Tr. 87\u201389)\n\n Exhibit M. \n8\n Exhibit N. \n9\n Tr. 123. \n10\n Exhibits B, D, E, F, G, P, V, and X. \n11\n Exhibit 1. \n12\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013collection account for $3,601.\nUnresolved. Now owes a total of about\n$18,000. (Exhibit O)\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent federal income taxes are for several tax years. He owed a\nsmall amount, less than $100, for tax year 1999. The IRS filed a tax lien against\nApplicant in December 2009, but the lien was released in February 2010 upon\npayment.  As of April 2010, he had an outstanding balance assessment of $13,631 for\n8\ntaxes owed for tax years 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.  He entered into an\n9\ninstallment agreement to repay this balance with payments of about $200 due on the\n15  on each month. All payments were timely made as of April 2010. He presented no\nth\npaperwork to reflect a more current status of his indebtedness to the IRS. He explained\nhe fell behind on his federal income taxes due to a combination of circumstances: (1) he\ndid not pay it because he was upset about the child-support arrearage; (2) he made bad\ndecisions; and (3) he lacked the money to pay.10\nIn addition, Applicant presented documentary proof of payment for several\ncollection accounts not alleged in the SOR.  Altogether, he paid off approximately\n11\n$1,500 in delinquent debts. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2008.  In\n12\ndoing so, he was required to provide truthful answers to various questions about his\nbackground, to include his financial record. In response to three questions about his\nfinancial record, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d thereby denying any unpaid judgments, debts\nmore than 180-days delinquent in the last seven years, and debts more than 90-days\ndelinquent currently. He did not report any of the indebtedness alleged in the SOR. \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n13\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n5\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n14\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n24\n See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n25\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n AG \u00b6 18.  \n26\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n27\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n28\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f). \n29\n6\nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n23\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n25\nF is:\n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n26\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation within the defense industry.   \nThe evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n27\n28\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions.  \nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:29\n\n7\n\u00b6 20(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b6 20(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\u00b6 20(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n\u00b6 20(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n\u00b6 20(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent are \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).\nApplicant receives credit under each due to his brief period of unemployment, his wife\u2019s\nunemployment, and his efforts to repay his creditors. But the credit in mitigation is not\nsufficient to overcome the security concerns. There are not clear indications that his\nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control, as the evidence suggests\nthe opposite. As revealed by the table above, Applicant has six unresolved debts for a\ntotal of about $50,000. It does not appear he has the financial means to resolve that\nindebtedness along with repaying his back taxes to the IRS. And of that $50,000,\napproximately $21,000 of it is a child-support arrearage, which is viewed with disfavor\ngiven the nature of the obligation. Looking forward, it is most probable that he will not\nresolve this situation in the near future, and his financial problems will continue or recur.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.  \nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\n\n AG \u00b6 15. \n30\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9).\n31\n8\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n30\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to three questions about\nhis financial record on the 2008 security clearance application. Rather than analyze\neach question and answer individually, it is appropriate to consider them together and\nanalyze them based on the evidence as a whole. In doing so, the evidence shows\nApplicant answered the questions incorrectly as he failed to report the financial matters\ncalled for by the questions. Applicant has explained that he did so because he was\nunaware of what was reflected on his credit history. Having listened to his testimony,\nobserved his demeanor, and reviewed the evidence of his overall financial situation, I\nam persuaded that he did not have full command and understanding of his financial\nsituation and this shortcoming resulted in his incorrect, but not deliberately false,\nanswers to the questions. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, the evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, past and present,\njustifies current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following\nEgan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting\nnational security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-\nperson concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant did not\n31\nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. At this\npoint, Applicant\u2019s suitability or fitness for a security clearance is a work in progress.\nTime will tell if Applicant has both the ability and willingness to clean up his financial\nhouse. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.          \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Donna Roth, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) as part of his employment with a defense contractor on July 24, 2008. After an \ninvestigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nAugust 24, 2009, to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 5, 2009, admitting six and \ndenying one of the allegations under Guideline F. He also denied with explanation the \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsecurity concern based on his finances. Applicant requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 4, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on November 23, 2009, scheduling a hearing for December 11 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. \nApplicant and two witnesses testified on his behalf. Applicant offered four exhibits, \nmarked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through D, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 28, 2009. \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on November 28, 2009, 14 days before \nthe hearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \nE3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of December \n11, 2009, before the Notice of Hearing was issued on November 23, 2009. Since \nApplicant discussed the hearing date with Department Counsel before the Notice of \nHearing was issued, actual notice was given more than 15 days before the hearing. At \nthe hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 3-4). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations in the SOR. I included \nApplicant's admissions in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, \ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has been employed as the facilities security officer \nand procurement agent for a defense contractor for approximately seven years. He \nserved 22 years on active duty with the Air Force, retiring in 2003 in the grade of master \nsergeant (E-7) with an honorable discharge. He has held a security clearance since \n1981. He received two associate's degrees while in the Air Force. Applicant married in \n1984, separated in March 2006, and divorced in March 2007. There were two children \nfrom the marriage (Tr. 13-14, 41-43; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated July 24, 2008; Gov. Ex. 2, \nAnswers to Interrogatories, dated May 21, 2009, DD 214 at 5). Applicant's monthly \nsalary is approximately $2,200 and he receives another $1,170 monthly in military \nretired pay and disability. Child support payments of $1,094 have been taken from his \nsalary before he receives his net monthly income. His former wife's share of his military \nretirement has already been deducted before he receives his military retired pay. His \ntotal monthly net income is approximately $3,300. His monthly expenses are \napproximately $2,300 leaving approximately $1,000 monthly in discretionary funds. \nApplicant has $1,700 in saving and another $25,000 in his 401(K) account (Tr. 33-50). \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated July 29, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, dated June 22, 2009; \nand Gov. Ex. 6, dated November 4, 2009) show the following delinquent debts for \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant: a debt for a computer for $507 (SOR 1.a); two credit card debts to the same \ncreditor for $4,988 (SOR 1.b) and $2,797 (SOR 1.c); a debt in collection on a credit card \nfor $2,623 (SOR 1.d); a debt in collection for a bank of $22,400 (SOR 1.e); a debt in \ncollection for telephone service for $1,627 (SOR 1.f); and another debt to the same \nbank listed in SOR 1.e for $7,701 (SOR 1.g). The total delinquent debt listed in the SOR \nis $42,000. The delinquent debts arose from 1998 to about 2008 (Tr. 8-9). \n \nApplicant's wife managed the family finances while Applicant was on active duty. \nShe did not pay their bills when they became due. Applicant was not aware of the \ndetails of the family finances since he was on deployment or working. He periodically \nasked his wife about the state of their finances, and she always informed him that their \nfinances were good and debts were being paid. However, Applicant learned that their \nfinances were deteriorating when he received notice of late or past-due payments from \ncreditors. His wife quit her well-paying job and did not immediately seek employment \nwhile the debts mounted. Applicant encouraged his wife to seek work, but his wife did \nnot work for many months. She finally found another job but quit after a few months \nbecause she did not like the work. She continued to use credit cards for purchases and \nnot pay the family bills. She again went without work for a few months until she started \nanother job. A few months later she was fired from that job for embezzling funds from \nher employer to use to pay some of her debts. Applicant inquired into their finances and \nlearned that their house was in danger of foreclosure, his cars were about to be \nrepossessed because they were months behind on car payments, and credit card debts \nhad not been paid. He also learned that his wife had taken money from accounts she \nwas managing for his elderly father and used the funds for herself and not his father. \nApplicant and his wife attempted a debt consolidation but it did not continue after his \nwife lost employment. When Applicant separated from his wife, he realized that they \nwere $52,000 in debt and his wife was continuing to incur debt in his name (Tr. 13-16; \n56-60; Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated may 21, 2009, Report of \nInvestigation, at 5-6; App. Ex. A, Affidavit, dated March 2006). \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in March 2006. Applicant continued to pay the \nfamily debts as best he could while also providing support to his former wife and \nchildren. Since then, Applicant has paid off both his car and his wife's van, and other \naccounts, and continued to pay support for his former wife and his children. However, \nhis wife continued to incur debts. Applicant pressed for their house to be sold after the \ndivorce in 2007, so the profit could be used to pay debts. Applicant's wife was reluctant \nto sell the house. She delayed signing the sales documents, and Applicant had to \ncontinue paying the mortgage from March 2006, when he moved out, until it was sold, \nbecause he did not want the house foreclosed. The house was placed on the market in \nSeptember 2007, and sold in April 2008. Applicant and his wife realized $27,515.45 \nfrom the sale of the house (Tr. 14-16, 56-59). \n \nApplicant agreed to use his wife's divorce attorney to assist with settlement and \npayment of the marriage debts from the proceeds of the sale of the house. When the \nhouse was sold, the attorney used $6,437 of the proceeds to pay debts. The delinquent \ndebt at SOR 1.a for the purchase of a computer was paid from the proceeds of the sale \n\n \n4 \n \n \nof the house (Tr. 25-28; Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, dated April 8, 2009, at \n13-14). Other debts were paid that are not listed in the SOR. Seven debts, that \nApplicant thought would be paid in full or part from the sale of the house, were not paid. \nThe attorney noted that while these debts were outstanding, they would not be paid off \nbecause the statute of limitations had run, or the actual owner and the amount of the \ndebt could not be ascertained. The delinquent debts at SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g are \nincluded in this list of debts not to be paid. The delinquent debts at SOR 1.c and 1.f are \nnot included in the list but are included in those debts affected by the statute of \nlimitations and inability to determine the creditor. Applicant's attorney tried to contact all \nof the creditors but was not successful. Even as late as December 2008, when checks \nfrom the proceeds of the sale of the house were being mailed to potential creditors, the \nattorney was receiving information from creditors that they no longer held the debt and \ncould not accept payment. Applicant made no attempt to contact the creditors or to \nmake payments on these debts. He was acting on the advice of an attorney who \ninformed him if he contacted the creditors or made any payments, the timelines for \nenforcing the debts would start to run again (Tr. 16-21, 28-33, 66-67; Gov. Ex. 3, \nAnswers to Interrogatories, dated April 8, 2009, at 13-14; App. Ex. B at Exhibit A, Letter, \ndated October 10, 2008). The $6,437 in debts paid by the attorney left $21,078.45 from \nthe sale of the house which was split evenly between Applicant and his wife. Applicant \nused his share of the proceeds to pay other debts, pay for medical care for his fianc\u00e9e's \ndaughter, and repair his car. He also put $1,700 in savings (Tr. 28-32). \n \nApplicant is considered an excellent employee by his company. His immediate \nsupervisor noted that he has known Applicant for several years. Applicant is a hard \nworking and dedicated employee who is consistently reliable. He is one of their most \ntrusted employees. He considers Applicant as ethically strong and a patriotic individual \nwho is loyal to the United States. He recommends Applicant be granted access to \nclassified information (Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, at 21).  \nApplicant's fianc\u00e9e testified that she worked closely with Applicant for about five \nyears when she also worked at the same company as Applicant. There never were any \nquestions in the company about Applicant's integrity and ability to maintain confidential \ninformation (Tr. 53-56). Applicant's friend testified he has known Applicant for over five \nyears. He sees Applicant socially but they do not work together. Applicant has an \noutstanding reputation for personal and professional conduct. There is no question \nconcerning his integrity and ability to maintain confidential information (Tr. 71-74). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. The delinquent debts listed in credit reports for Applicant are a security \nconcern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 AG 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant incurred delinquent debt during his marriage \nwhen he permitted his wife to manage the family finances without his adequate \ninvolvement. His wife did not pay their debts, instead spending money on luxuries. \nSince his divorce, Applicant paid some of his debts but some still remain. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. The debts were \nincurred because of his wife's misconduct and failure to use their family funds to pay \ndebts when due. His financial problems are partially beyond his control because the \ndelinquent debts arose through his wife's action that he was not aware of. He asked his \nwife about their finances, and she left him with the information that they were not in \nfinancial trouble. However, Applicant could have been more fully involved in the family \nfinances, and, if he did, he would have learned earlier of their financial issues. Since \nthen, Applicant has been acting responsibly under the circumstances. He separated \nfrom and divorced his wife, took charge of his finances, pressed to have their house \nsold to get funds to pay debts, and paid as many of the debts as his finances permitted.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. The \nconcept of good-faith action requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. An applicant \nmust do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such \nas the statute of limitations) in order to claim the benefit of the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating \ncondition. Applicant has the funds to pay his debts since he has money in savings and a \n401K account. Applicant paid some of his delinquent debts. The SOR lists only those \ndebts that are still outstanding. The proceeds from the sale of his house paid one of \nthese debts. However, he has not paid the other debts because he does not know the \nbackground and reasons for some of the debts, cannot clearly identify the creditor to be \n\n \n7 \n \n \npaid, and has followed the advice of an attorney not to contact creditors or pay debts \nthat are close to being unenforceable because of a statute of limitations.  \n \nApplicant's state of residence has a three-year statute of limitation provision for \nenforcements of debts. The statute has the societal, judicial, and public policy rationale \nto stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote stability to human affairs. It is \nintended to promote and achieve finality in litigation. The statute of limitations provides \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be taken \nto court to defend time-barred claims. The statute of limitations clearly and \nunequivocally ends an applicant\u2019s legal responsibility to pay the creditor after the \npassage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. However the application \nof a state statute of limitations on debt collection does not automatically mitigate \nfinancial considerations concerns under AG \u00b6 20(d). An Applicant may be relieved of \nlegal and financial responsibility for a debt not paid because the timeline for enforcing \nthe debts had run, but the debt may remain a security concern even though not \ncollectible. His actions show some good-faith but his failure to pay the debts because of \nthe potential lack of enforcement by the statute of limitation is not a good-faith effort.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant served 22 \nyeas on active duty in the Air Force, he received an honorable discharge, and \nsuccessfully held a security clearance for over 30 years. I considered that Applicant has \na reputation in his company as well as the community for reliability, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. The issue is not simply \nwhether all of Applicant's debts are paid. It is whether his financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant's wife managed the \nfamily finances. She did not pay the family bills and used the funds for other purposes. \nShe also was involved in fraudulent financial activities with Applicant's father's funds \nand the funds from her employer. Applicant did not know the debts were not paid even \nthough he asked his wife about their finances. Applicant has some culpability in regard \nto the delinquent debts because he did not exercise sufficient interest in the finances. \nHowever, once he learned of the financial issues, he separated from and eventually \ndivorced his wife. He entered a property agreement to use the proceeds from the sale of \ntheir house to pay some of their debts. He continued to pay other debts from his own \nresources. These actions establish a track record of debt payment of his delinquent \ndebts. Delinquent debts remain and are listed in the SOR. He has not paid them \nbecause enforcement of the debts under the state statute of limitations is or will shortly \nbe barred. \n \n  \nApplicant anticipated, most if not all, delinquent debts would be paid from the \nproceeds of the sale of their house. However, some were not and are listed of security \nconcern in the SOR. The debts were not paid for a variety of reasons. The attorney \nmanaging the property settlement from the divorce could not identify some of the \ncreditors, did not have accurate information on the amount of each debt, and the debts \nwere or would shortly be barred from enforcement under the statute of limitation. \nApplicant relied on the advice and guidance of the attorney in not inquiring about the \ndebts or making payments. He was relying on the debts not being collectible by the \npassage of time under the statute of limitations. Reliance on the statute of limitation to \nnot pay debts is not a good-faith effort to pay debts and normally is not considered as \nacting reasonably and responsibly concerning delinquent debt. However, under these \ncircumstances, Applicant demonstrated he acted reasonably and responsibly. The \nremaining unpaid delinquent debts are not the type indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. He did not cause the \nfinancial problems even though he should have been more active in the management of \nthe family finances. He paid some of the debts from his own resources, and pressed for \nthe sale of the house to generate funds to pay the delinquent debts. He is living within \nhis means and continues to pay his current debts as agreed. His reliance on the statute \nof limitation is based on the advice of the attorney managing the dissolution of the \nmarital property and payments of marital debts. Applicant established that he acted \nreasonably and responsibly towards his finances. His actions indicate he will act \nreasonably and responsibly to protect classified information. The management of his \nfinances indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and not careless concerning \nclassified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from \nhis financial situation. \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 29, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 22, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n2\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment[.]\u201d\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions and whether the Judge failed properly to apply the whole-\nperson factors.   Finding no error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working\nfor a Defense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer or a predecessor company since\n1978.  \nApplicant has filed for bankruptcy four times since 1984.  He was discharged twice in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, in 1985 and again in 1998.  His other two filings, both under Chapter 13, were\ndismissed, one in 1989 and the other in 2004.  The 1989 dismissal was due to non-payment, and the\n2004 was voluntary.  \nIn addition to the bankruptcy filings, the Judge also found that Applicant had, at the close of\nthe record, two delinquent debts.  The first was for $14,114 owed due to the repossession of a car.\nApplicant arranged a settlement of this debt with the creditor, agreeing to pay monthly installments\nof $150 toward a final settled amount of $7,276.  At the close of the record Applicant had made four\npayments.\nThe second delinquent debt was in the amount of $1,180, owed to a check-cashing company.\nAlthough Applicant initially denied this debt, based on his testimony at the hearing, the Judge\nconcluded that the debt was legitimately his and that it was still owed.\nApplicant was disciplined by his employer in 2008 for misusing a company credit card by\nmaking personal charges upon it in addition to charges related to company business.  Applicant\nenjoys a good reputation for job performance, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of the Guideline F mitigating\nconditions.  For example, he argues that his latest bankruptcy filing occurred in 2003, which was\nseveral years prior to the close of the record.  Therefore, he believes that his financial problems\noccurred long ago and should be mitigated by the passage of time.   The record demonstrates,\n2\nhowever, that while the Judge acknowledged record evidence concerning the timing of the latest\nbankruptcy filing, he also noted that, since that filing, Applicant acquired more delinquent debts, two\nsignificant ones remaining unpaid.  Accordingly, he reasonably concluded that Applicant had failed\nto demonstrate that the financial problems were behind him or were unlikely to recur.  \nThe Judge also acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial troubles were affected by\ncircumstances outside his control, for example a period of unemployment, medical expenses, and\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2. 20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n3\ncontrol . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d  \nThe misuse of the credit card formed the basis of the two Guideline E allegations, which the Judge resolved\n4\nin Applicant\u2019s favor.  However, the Judge also stated that, despite his conclusion under Guideline E, he would consider\nthis misconduct in the context of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, his case for mitigation, and the whole-person analysis.\nDecision at 8, n. 19.  \nA Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence in making a decision.  See, e.g.,\n5\nISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009).\na diminution in employer-provided reimbursement for travel expenses.   However, the Judge noted\n3\nother record evidence which was not so favorable to Applicant, for example testimony that Applicant\nmismanaged money, that he did not balance his checking account, that he did not live within a\nbudget, and that he misused the company credit card.   He concluded that Applicant had failed to\n4\ndemonstrate responsible behavior in regard to his debts.  After examining the Judge\u2019s decision in\nlight of the record as a whole, we conclude that he did not err in denying favorable application to the\nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not properly apply the whole-person factors.  He\ncontends, for example, that the Judge did not consider that he had paid off debts not listed in the\nSOR.  He also argues that the Judge failed to extend proper consideration to record evidence of his\ngood work habits, his character, and his having held a clearance for over 30 years without incident\nor concern.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 23, 2008).  The Judge acknowledged that Applicant had paid off many of the debts alleged in\nthe SOR.  However, the fact that he did not explicitly discuss non-SOR debts does not undermine\nhis unfavorable conclusion as to mitigation.  Even if he had explicitly discussed these other debts,5\nthere is little likelihood that he would have found their resolution sufficient to outweigh evidence\nthat Applicant continued to acquire delinquent debt despite having twice been discharged in\nbankruptcy, and other evidence of financial irresponsibility.    \nFurthermore, while the Judge found that Applicant enjoyed a good reputation for character\nand performance of duty, Applicant has provided no reason to believe that he weighed this positive\nevidence in a manner that is arbitrary capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies\nwith the requirements of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2, in that the Judge considered the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": ": Applicant is an engineer working for a Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer or a predecessor company since 1978. Applicant has filed for bankruptcy four times since 1984. He was discharged twice in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in 1985 and again in 1998. His other two filings, both under Chapter 13, were dismissed, one in 1989 and the other in 2004. The 1989 dismissal was due to non-payment, and the 2004 was voluntary. In addition to the bankruptcy filings, the Judge also found that Applicant had, at the close of the record, two delinquent debts. The first was for $14,114 owed due to the repossession of a car. Applicant arranged a settlement of this debt with the creditor, agreeing to pay monthly installments of $150 toward a final settled amount of $7,276. At the close of the record Applicant had made four payments. The second delinquent debt was in the amount of $1,180, owed to a check-cashing company. Although Applicant initially denied this debt, based on his testimony at the hearing, the Judge concluded that the debt was legitimately his and that it was still owed. Applicant was disciplined by his employer in 2008 for misusing a company credit card by making personal charges upon it in addition to charges related to company business. Applicant enjoys a good reputation for job performance, honesty, and trustworthiness. Applicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. For example, he argues that his latest bankruptcy filing occurred in 2003, which was several years prior to the close of the record. Therefore, he believes that his financial problems occurred long ago and should be mitigated by the passage of time. The record demonstrates, 2 however, that while the Judge acknowledged record evidence concerning the timing of the latest bankruptcy filing, he also noted that, since that filing, Applicant acquired more delinquent debts, two significant ones remaining unpaid. Accordingly, he reasonably concluded that Applicant had failed to demonstrate that the financial problems were behind him or were unlikely to recur. The Judge also acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial troubles were affected by circumstances outside his control, for example a period of unemployment, medical expenses, and Directive \u00b6 E2. 20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s 3 control . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d The misuse of the credit card formed the basis of the two Guideline E allegations, which the Judge resolved 4 in Applicant\u2019s favor.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nE and F, Personal Conduct and Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nFebruary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant received a copy of the SOR on June 24, 2009. He answered the SOR \non July 24, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to another administrative judge on September 28, 2009, and reassigned \nto me on September 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 9, 2009, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 9, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through L, which were \nreceived without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to \nsubmit additional information. Applicant submitted documents, which were marked AE \nM through S and admitted without objection.1 Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 22, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance, which he has held since 1979. Except for a period when \nhe was laid-off, he has worked for his current employer, or a predecessor company, \nsince 1978. He attended college for several years but did not obtain a degree. He has \nbeen married since 1978. He and his wife have two children, ages 27 and 25.2  \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties for many years. He and his wife \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1984, and their debts were discharged in 1985. They filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 1988. The bankruptcy was dismissed in 1989, after he was \nunable to maintain the payments to the trustee. They filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n1998, and their debts were discharged the same year. They filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin September 2003. The bankruptcy was dismissed in October 2004, for failure to make \nthe required payments to the plan. Applicant testified that they voluntarily withdrew from \nthe Chapter 13 bankruptcy because he wanted to purchase a home, and he did not \nknow if he would be permitted to do so while subject to the bankruptcy court\u2019s \njurisdiction. He stated that he planned on paying the debts on his own.3 \n \n \nApplicant attributed the 1984 bankruptcy to a failed business. He stated his wife \nstopped working in 1986, which placed a strain on their finances and led to the Chapter \n13 bankruptcy in 1988. He was laid-off from his job for a year in 1988 to 1989, and \n                                                          \n1 AE S is a copy of a credit report that Applicant meant to introduce at his hearing, but it was \ncopied incorrectly. Department Counsel submitted a copy after the hearing along with Applicant\u2019s exhibits. \nI have admitted the exhibit because it is in accordance with Applicant\u2019s original plans. \n \n2 Tr. at 27-28, 70-71; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 43-44, 56-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nstopped paying into his Chapter 13 plan. He admitted in a 1990 statement that he \n\u201cmismanage[d] money,\u201d and he \u201csometimes spen[t] the money allocated for bills on \nother expenses.\u201d4  \n \n \nApplicant stated that his 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy resulted from unpaid \nmedical expenses. Additionally, he purchased a new car believing one of their older \ncars was sold, but the buyer backed out of the purchase, leaving him with three car loan \npayments. He also had \u201ctoo many credit card bills.\u201d He admitted in a September 1998 \nstatement that he and his wife \u201calso had gotten into a very bad habit in that we did not \nbalance the bank statements and we were not living within a budget.\u201d5 He wrote in that \n1998 statement: \n \nSince the bankruptcy we now have a positive cash flow at the end of the \nmonth which we try to put away some of this every month so that we \nalways have a reserve. We also pay cash for everything and do not plan \nto change that, with the exception of a major purchase such as a car or a \nhouse. We have been very careful since the bankruptcy to balance the \nbank statement every month and watch what we spend so that we are \nalways within budget. We do not want to repeat the mistakes that we \nmade to date.6 \n \n \nApplicant attributed the 2003 bankruptcy to changes in his employer\u2019s policies on \nbonuses and reimbursing car expenses, which caused his income to decrease about \n$1,000 per month.7 In a November 2003 statement, he wrote: \n \nTo the best of my knowledge, the accounts on my current bankruptcy are \nclosed and I am not going to reopen them. I am not going to secure any \nadditional credit. I understand it is my responsibility to pay my bills and \ndebts. However, my income was reduced through no fault of my own. I am \nmaking an earnest effort to live within my means.8  \n \n \nIn addition to his four bankruptcies, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, with \nbalances totaling $16,932. Applicant denied owing all the debts at the time of his \nresponse, with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.i, which he \npartially admitted. He also provided explanations about the debts. All of the debts are \nlisted on one or more of the credit reports obtained in June 2008, December 2008, \nMarch 2009, and December 2009.9 Specific debts are addressed below.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 56-58; GE 6. \n \n5 GE 5. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Tr. at 56-57; GE 4. \n \n8 GE 4. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8-11. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges a delinquent debt of $14,114 to a collection company for the \ndeficiency owed on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed in about 2004. In \nAugust 2009, Applicant agreed to settle the debt for $7,276 through monthly payments \nof $150. He made the first four payments. He told the company that he would attempt to \nincrease the payments as his financial situation improves.10 \n \n \nApplicant paid the $52 delinquent medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f on July 6, \n2009. He settled the delinquent debt of $644 to a collection company on behalf of a \nwomen\u2019s-clothing catalog/internet company on July 30, 2009. This debt was alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.g. He paid delinquent debts of $72 and $265 owed to the same credit card \ncompany on August 10, 2009. The $72 debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h. The $265 debt \nwas not alleged in the SOR.11 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges a delinquent debt of $534 to a collection company for medical \nexpenses. Applicant contacted the collection company and discovered that it was not \nhis debt. The debt was deleted from his credit report.12 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $1,180 to a collection company on \nbehalf of a check cashing/loan company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j. Applicant stated that \nthe debt was removed from his credit report. He was asked if he originally owed the \ncreditor. He responded: \n \nThat was one that I had that was part of the bankruptcy, but I couldn\u2019t find \nany documentation that I paid it, but when I contacted them that was - - \nagain, it was not me so they removed it from the credit [report].13 \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on August 30, 2008, by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He was asked about his \nfinances and the delinquent debts that were listed on the credit report. A signed \nstatement was not taken, but the interview was summarized in a report of investigation \n(ROI). DOHA sent the ROI to Applicant in an interrogatory and asked him if the ROI \naccurately reflected the information he provided to the investigator. He responded that it \ndid not, and he provided almost two pages of corrections. Applicant discussed the \n$1,180 debt with the investigator. He stated that before his 2003 bankruptcy, he went to \nthe creditor to obtain a loan to pay his debts. He did not pay the loan company back \nbecause he did not have the funds. He contacted the collection company in 2004, in \norder to make payment arrangements. The company wanted payment in full, which he \nwas not able to do. He indicated that the debt had not been paid. In the corrections to \nthe ROI submitted in response to DOHA interrogatories on March 3, 2009, Applicant did \nnot correct any of the information in the ROI about this debt. He certified that, subject to \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 44-46, 61-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 8-11; AE H, L. \n \n11 Tr. at 63-65, 69-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, I, K. \n \n12 Tr. at 66-67; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8-11; AE S. \n \n13 Tr. at 67. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe corrections he made, the ROI accurately summarized his interview. This debt is \nlisted by Experian on the joint credit report obtained in June 2008. It is not listed on the \nthree Equifax credit reports from December 2008, March 2009, and December 2009, or \nthe October 2009 credit report submitted by Applicant.14 \n  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.k alleges a delinquent debt of $336 owed to a city in a different state \nthan where Applicant lives. The debt was for an unpaid parking ticket issued in February \n2006. Applicant\u2019s son received the ticket after he borrowed Applicant\u2019s truck. Applicant \ncontacted the city in 2006, and informed them that his son was driving the vehicle when \nthe ticket was issued. The city informed Applicant that because he was the registered \nowner of the vehicle, he was liable for the ticket. Applicant did not pay the ticket for \nseveral years because he did not feel responsible for the citation. He told the OPM \ninvestigator in August 2008, that he would contact his son to pay the ticket. Applicant \npaid the citation on July 31, 2009, after he received the SOR.15  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as required for his bankruptcy in 2003. \nHe has a detailed budget. He stated the counseling has helped him manage his \nfinances, live within his budget, and not incur new delinquent debt. He obtained a 15-\nyear mortgage when he purchased his home. It costs him about $400 more per month \nthan a 30-year mortgage, but it will save him more than $200,000 in interest over the life \nof the mortgage. He owns a 2005 model car for which he pays $536 per month to the \ncreditor. When he has completed paying that loan, he plans on paying an extra $500 \nper month to the auto loan for his wife\u2019s vehicle, so that loan will be paid early.16 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s company issued him a corporate credit card. The company policy \nlimited the card to business-related expenses only. Applicant used the card for personal \npurchases from about 2000, through when the company switched to a different credit \ncard in late 2007. Applicant stated that he thought the card could be used for personal \npurposes as long as the balance was paid. He would submit his monthly business \nexpenses to his company, and the company would pay the credit card company directly. \nThe bills were mailed to Applicant. He would estimate what he spent for personal \npurchases and pay that amount. The balance on the account grew over the years. By \nthe time the company switched to another card, his personal balance had grown to \nmore than $2,000. Applicant received the new corporate card in late 2007. The original \ncard was paid in full with payments of $4,200 on February 18, 2008, and $2,281 on \nMarch 3, 2008. Applicant\u2019s company placed him on unpaid leave for one week; his \nsupervisor was required to monitor his corporate card for six months; and he had to \nattend ethics classes. There is no indication of any recurrence of this type of behavior.17 \n \n                                                          \n14 GE 2, 8-11; AE S. \n \n15 Tr. at 68-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE J. \n \n16 Tr. at 43-47, 57-61, 71; AE G. \n \n17 Tr. at 29-43, 48-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE E, F, M-P. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security manager testified favorably about his job performance, \nhonesty, and trustworthiness. He has been recognized by his company and the U.S. \nmilitary with numerous awards and commendatory materials. Character letters from \nsupervisors and managers attest to his work performance, respect for security rules and \nregulations, professionalism, integrity, and judgment. His character references \nrecommend him for a security clearance.18  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n                                                          \n18 Tr. at 75-77; AE B-F, Q. \n\n \n7 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant violated his company\u2019s policy by using his corporate credit card for \npersonal purchases from about 2000 to 2007. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable as \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n\n \n8 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his actions. He was disciplined by his \ncompany, received ethics training, and there is no evidence of any recurrence of that \nbehavior. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) are applicable. Personal Conduct security concerns \nhave been mitigated.19 \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n                                                          \n19 While I found the Personal Conduct security concerns were mitigated, the information is \nrelevant in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation; in the application of Financial Considerations \nmitigating conditions; and in evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant filed bankruptcy in 1984, 1988, 1998, and 2003. AG \u00b6 20(a) would be \napplicable to those actions but for the fact that he still has not paid all the delinquent \ndebt from his 2003 bankruptcy. I am unable to find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed the 1984 bankruptcy to a failed business. His wife stopped \nworking in 1986, and he was laid-off from his job for a year in about 1988. He had \nunpaid medical expenses, a buyer reneged on an offer to buy his car, and his company \nchanged its bonus and auto reimbursement policies, resulting in a substantial loss of \nincome. All of these incidents could potentially qualify as conditions that were outside \nhis control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant also admitted that he mismanaged \nmoney, spent the money allocated for bills on other expenses, had too many credit card \nbills, did not balance his bank statements, did not live within a budget, and used his \ncorporate credit card for personal purchases. Despite twice having his debts discharged \nin bankruptcy, he continued to accrue delinquent debts. I do not find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. He paid the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 2.g, 2.h, and 2.k. He also paid a $265 debt that was not \nalleged in the SOR. The total amount owed on those five debts was $1,369. All of the \ndebts were paid in July and August 2009, after he received the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \napplicable to those debts. He began making $150 monthly payments in August 2009, to \nsettle the $14,114 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e for $7,276. The four payments to that \ncreditor are not yet sufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his other \ndebts.20 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to his other debts. Applicant has not established \nthat the problem is being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. \n \n \nApplicant successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.i. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to that debt. He denied owing the $1,180 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j. He \ntestified that the debt was removed from his credit report because \u201cit was not [him].\u201d He \nadmitted to the OPM investigator that he obtained a loan from that creditor before his \n2003 bankruptcy, and he did not pay it. Accounts are removed from credit reports for \nmany reasons unrelated to the validity of the debt. I find that Applicant failed to establish \nthat he is not responsible for this debt. The debt is unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable \nto that debt.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n20 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n11 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He filed bankruptcy on four \noccasions, and twice had his debts discharged. He voluntarily withdrew from his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy because he wanted to purchase a home, and he did not know if \nhe would be permitted to do so while subject to the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction. He \npurchased a home and obtained a 15-year mortgage. He stated that he planned on \npaying the debts on his own. He paid five debts totaling $1,369 and began paying $150 \nper month to settle a $14,114 debt for $7,276 after he received the SOR. He denied \nresponsibility for a debt because it was removed from his credit report, when that debt is \nclearly his. He wrote in a September 1998 statement that he and his wife had a positive \ncash flow at the end of the month, they paid cash for everything, and they did not want \nto repeat the mistakes that led to their bankruptcies. That is similar to what he \npresented at his hearing. About two years after that statement, Applicant began using \nhis corporate credit card for personal purchases. About five years later, he filed Chapter \n13 bankruptcy. Two debts remain unpaid. I considered Applicant\u2019s long and \ncommendable work history and his favorable character evidence. However, his finances \ncontinue to be a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct concerns but has not mitigated \nFinancial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.f-2.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \nSubparagraph 2.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

On January 13, 2010, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \nJuly 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered (AR) the SOR in writing on February 18, 2010, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 15, 2010, DOHA \nassigned the case to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on March 24, 2010. The case \nwas heard on April 28, 2010, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and called \ntwo witnesses. He offered three exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 6, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e of the SOR. He denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a \nand 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and unmarried. He has three children, ages six, four, \nand two, with his long-term girlfriend. He grew up in a military environment as his father \nserved in the Army for 31 years. He graduated from high school in 2000 and started \nworking for defense contractors in February 2002. He has been steadily employed,  \nexcept for a six month period from October 2007 to April 2008. In May 2008, he started \nhis present position as an engineering technician. He was laid off from his position in \nMarch 2010 pending the disposition of this case. \n \n \nApplicant has a criminal history, involving five arrests and four convictions. In \nMay 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with Burglary of a Vehicle, a felony, \nafter he and his friends stole a fishing pole out a truck. He pleaded guilty and was \nplaced on probation for one year. He was 17 years old. (Tr. 58; GE 2) In September \n1998, he was arrested and charged with Burglary of Habitation, a felony, after he and \nfriends stole items out of an open garage. He pleaded guilty, served 30 days in jail, \nplaced on probation for five years, fined $1,000, and paid $216 in court costs. The \nprobation terminated early in May 2001. (Tr. 59; GE 2 at 2.) He attributed both incidents \nto immaturity and associating with the wrong friends. (Id.)  \n \n \nIn November 2003, Applicant was approached by a man, who claimed that he \nneeded money to buy medicine for his children. The man asked Applicant to pawn a \ntelevision for him because he was unable to do so with his out-of-state identification. \nApplicant agreed to help the man. After learning that the television was stolen, he was \narrested and charged with Burglary of Habitation, a felony, in March 2004. Applicant \nwas released from jail after five days and the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 53; GE 2 at \n4.) Applicant\u2019s father was present at the time the man approached his son. Both \nApplicant\u2019s father and Applicant had previously seen the man in the neighborhood \nbefore the incident. His father was not alarmed by the man\u2019s request and suggested \nthat his son help the man. (Tr.  41-44.) \n \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While \nIntoxicated (DWI), a misdemeanor, after he and his friend were stopped by the police. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined $3,000, payable in $1,000 increments per \nyear. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. (GE at  4.) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with another DWI. He \nconsumed about six alcoholic drinks at a club before getting into his car and bumping \ninto a parked car. On September 19, 2008, he pleaded guilty to DWI, a misdemeanor. \nHe was sentenced to 120 days in jail, fined $1,000, ordered to attend repeat alcohol \noffender class, and placed on supervised probation for 18 months. He was required to \nhave an Ignition Interlock system placed on his automobile and undergo monthly \nurinalysis screenings. (GE 2 at 4; GE 7.) On March 19, 2010, the court entered an order \nterminating the probation and allowing him to remove the Ignition Interlock system. (Tr. \n72; AE 3.)  \n \n \nThe court did not require Applicant to undergo an alcohol evaluation after the last \nconviction, but did require him to participate in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In \n2009, he attended three two-hour meetings and two educational sessions per week for \nsix weeks. (Tr. 67, 75-76.) He has not obtained any counseling or participated in any \nother alcohol educational program. He does not believe he has a drinking problem or \nthat his previous consumption of alcohol has affected his family. (Tr. 69, 70, 73.)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that on occasion between 1999 and 2008, he consumed \nalcohol to excess. (Tr. 65.) He began drinking when he was 18 years old. For four \nyears, Applicant regularly drank 15 to 20 beers over the weekend with friends. Since \n2003, he has attempted to moderate his consumption. (GE 2 at 5.) Presently, he \nconsumes 12 to 18 beers throughout the week, or possibly over a weekend. (Tr. 65, 74-\n76.) He considers himself a social drinker. (Tr. 77.) He no longer drives after consuming \nalcohol. (Tr. 73, 76.) As a consequence of the DWI convictions, he had to spend a large \namount of money and learned that \u201cit\u2019s not worth it\u201d to drink and drive. (Tr. 76.) \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified. He is a retired Army staff sergeant with an impressive \nservice record, who honorably served for 31 years and deployed to locations throughout \nthe world. For the past 11 years, he has worked for defense contractors. Currently, he is \na weapons tactics instructor. He held a security clearance during his military years and \nwhile working for defense contractors. He is aware of his son\u2019s criminal history, but \nbelieves he has matured since the last incident and is responsibly managing his life. He \nand his son have a close relationship and speak frequently because his son and family \nlive in the same neighborhood. He believes that his son \u201chas tremendous potential to be \na good, productive citizen if he\u2019s only allowed or given the opportunity to do so.\u201d (Tr. \n36.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified. She was present when the man requested her son to \npawn the television. (Tr. 20.) She verified that the matter was dismissed. (Tr. 21.) She \nwas supportive of her son. \n \n \nApplicant was remorseful about his criminal behavior and previous immaturity. \nHe acknowledged that alcohol created problems for his employment, but is uncertain \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwhy he continues to consume it. (Tr. 78.) He presented a letter from his landlord, who \nconsiders him to be a good tenant and family man. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuse or alcohol dependent. \nApplicant has two alcohol-related incidents in his history. In 2004 and 2008, he \nwas arrested and convicted of DWI. Based on those incidents, the Government raised a \nsecurity concern under AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant admitted that from 1999 up to May 2008, \nhe consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication. That evidence \nis sufficient to raise the disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 22(c). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate those disqualifications are provided under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) provides some mitigation because Applicant\u2019s last DWI occurred in \nMay 2008, approximately two years ago. However, it was his second offense, raising \nquestions about his judgment and precluding the full application of said mitigating \ncondition. AG \u00b6 23(b) provides minimal mitigation. Applicant acknowledged his previous \nimmature behavior. He denies that he has an alcohol problem. The only evidence he \npresented documenting actions taken to address the issue, was his recent release from \nprobation and testimony that he no longer consumes alcohol and drives. He did not \nprovide any independent evidence establishing a pattern of sobriety or responsible \ndrinking, which is also referenced under this guideline. In addition, he admitted that he \ndrinks 12 to 18 beers during the week or on a weekend, indicating that he has not \nsignificantly reduced his alcohol consumption. There is no evidence in the record to \nsupport the application of AG \u00b6 23(c) or AG \u00b6 23(d), which require active participation in \nformalized treatment programs. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \nFrom 1998 to 2008, Applicant was arrested five times, convicted four times, and \nsentenced four times. The evidence raised both disqualifications.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides a condition that could mitigate disqualifications arising under \nthis guideline: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nApplicant expressed remorse for his criminal history. He was arrested and \nconvicted of two burglary charges in 1998, when he was 17 years old. His next arrest \noccurred in 2003, when he was 22 years old. That charge was later dismissed. A year \nlater, in 2004 at the age of 23, he was arrested and convicted of DWI. His next offense \noccurred in 2008, when he was again arrested and convicted of DWI. In March 2010, \nthe court entered an order terminating his probation and authorizing the removal of the \nbreathalyzer lock system from his car. Since that last arrest, he has not been charged \nwith criminal misconduct. He has worked for his current employer for eight years. His \nremorsefulness, work record, and successful completion of all probationary terms are \nevidence of rehabilitation. However, given that he completed his third and most recent \nprobationary term within the past three months, the evidence of rehabilitation presented \nis insufficient to fully mitigate his criminal history that spans ten years. He has only been \noutside the legal system for three months, which is insufficient to conclude that his \npattern of criminal conduct is in the past.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an intelligent 29-year-\nold man, who possesses potential for success in his career and strong parental support. \nHe expressed a commitment to his job and changing his behavior.  He asserted that he \nis careful not to drink and drive any more. However, his change in attitude is recent and \ndoes not adequately mitigate the concerns raised by the Government. While he appears \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhonest and dedicated to moving forward with his life, he has not established a track \nrecord of exercising good judgment, outside of a court-ordered probation, sufficient to \npersuade me that he appreciates the havoc excessive alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct has played in his life and family. Other than assertions that he consumes \nalcohol responsibly (which based on the quantities he drinks is questionable), he \nprovided no independent evidence to corroborate his testimony that similar problems \nare unlikely to recur. In fact, he feels that he does not have an alcohol problem, or \nunderstand why he continues to routinely drink alcohol despite two convictions for DWI. \nSince his second DWI arrest, he has chosen not to participate in any form of counseling \nor rehabilitation, other than attending several mandatory Alcoholics Anonymous \nmeetings. Absent such evidence, his testimony and recent release from criminal \nprobation does not adequately document permanent behavioral insight and changes.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2010, and was scheduled for\nhearing on April 1, 2010. A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of nine exhibits, which were admitted as\nexhibits 1 through 9. Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and five\nexhibits, which were admitted as exhibits A through E. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non April 8, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his permanent loan approval regarding his  residence, his\nassumed mortgage obligations covered in subparagraphs 1.m and 1.o of the SOR, and\nthe judgment covered in subparagraph 1.a of the SOR. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. The Government was granted\ntwo days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with\ncopies of his judgment covered in subparagraph 1.a, first and second mortgage\napprovals covered by subparagraphs 1.m and 1.o, and furnished a payment schedule\nfrom the first trust holder covered in subparagraph 1.i. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits\nwere admitted as exhibits F through L and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 13 debts\nexceeding $154,000 and (b) and had a personal judgment taken against him December\n2006 in the amount of $2,167. Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified\nhis public trust application (SF-85P), executed in July 2007 by denying any adverse\njudgment taken against him.  \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the listed debts without any\nexplanations.  He denied any intentional falsification of his application for a public trust\nposition (SF-85P) and attributed his omission to a misunderstanding of the nature of the\njudgment covered by subparagraph 1.a.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old contract bid specialist for a defense contractor who\nseeks a trustworthiness determination. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\n\n3\nApplicant married in June 2005.  He has four children, ages 20, 16, 9, and 4,\nthree of whom reside with him.  See Ex. 1; Tr. 53.  All but his last child are from other\nmarriages of his wife and himself . Tr. 53, 56-57.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant and his wife purchased their first home in January 2005 and financed\ntheir purchase with a $137,000 first mortgage with creditor 1.n.  See Exs. 6 and 7. In\nApril 2006, they purchased a second home and financed this purchase with a $363,985\nfirst mortgage on the property from creditor 1.m.  See Exs. 6 and 7; Tr. 84.  Sometime\nin the summer of 2006, they signed a rental agreement with a single mother with four\nchildren to lease their first home for $1,167 a month. See Exs. F and H; Tr. 59.  Before\nthe prospective renter could move in, Applicant and his wife changed their mind and told\nthe renter not to move into their property. The renter defied the instruction and moved\ninto the home. Exs. F and G. Applicant and his wife followed with a 30-day notice to quit\nthe premises.  Court records document that the renter vacated the premises.\n In March 2008, Applicant and his wife obtained a home equity loan on their\nsecond home from creditor 1.m in the amount of $91,000.  See Exs. 5, 6, and 7; Tr.\n100-01.  They secured the loan with a second trust deed. Tr. 101.\nAt the time they purchased their second home, Applicant was making about\n$80,000 a year from his construction job.  His wife earned $40,000 a year from her work\nwith a non-profit organization. Tr. 58, 60-61.  \nApplicant and his wife encountered financial difficulties in 2006 and 2007 after\nboth lost their jobs. See Ex. C; Tr. 57-61. Applicant\u2019s loss of work was due to a\nweakening economy in his  community.  Tr. 106.  His wife contracted a West Nile virus\nin the summer of 2006 that debilitated her and forced her to take indefinite leave from\nher job. See ex. B ; Tr. 51-52. With their limited income from his wife\u2019s disability income\nand his own part-time jobs, they were unable to keep paying their bills and defaulted on\nmost of them.  Tr. 47.  \nRealizing they could not keep up with their debts, Applicant and his wife explored\npetitioning for bankruptcy in July 2007. See Ex. A; Tr. 62, 96-97.  Records show that\ncreditor 1.n assigned its $364,000 first mortgage to creditor 1.o in March 2007. See Ex.\n9; Tr. 85.  However, creditor 1.n retained its second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s property.\nEx. 9.  By August 2007, Applicant and his wife had fallen behind on their creditor 1.o\nfirst mortgage and faced potential foreclosure.  See Ex. K.\nWhen Applicant and his wife could not address their mortgage delinquency with\ncreditor 1.o, the latter initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings against the\nborrowers in February 2008 and completed the foreclosure several months later. See\nExs.  9 and A; Tr. 84.  They continued to pay on their rental property for a number of\nmonths before falling behind in their payments to creditor 1.n as well.   \n\n4\nIn December 2009, Applicant and his wife petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nrelief.  Records document their receiving the required financial counseling before filing\ntheir petition.  Ex. A. In their joint petition, they scheduled $191,687 in secured claims\nand $98,588 in unsecured debts.  See Ex. A. Petitioners included the charged off\nsecond mortgage of creditor 1.m in their unsecured schedule, which  they reported as a\ndeficiency on their foreclosed second home.  See ex. A; Tr. 87-89.  Even though\ncreditor 1.m had previously charged off this debt following creditor 1.o\u2019s foreclosure of\nits first mortgage interest, it retained a potential deficiency claim for its sold-out junior\nlien.  \nIn their Chapter 7 unsecured claims schedule, Applicant and his wife also\nincluded a judgment claim of creditor 1.a in the amount of $2,167.  See ex. A; Tr. 72.\nThe judgment is linked to the rental dispute Applicant and his wife had with their tenant\nof their first home.  Applicant characterizes the claim as a small claims judgment in the\nclaimant\u2019s favor without any mention of a set-off. \nApplicant and his wife document their Chapter 7 discharge in March 2010.  Ex. A.\nExcept for any potential deficiency claims from creditor 1.o, all of the debts listed in the\nSOR were scheduled in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 petition. As a caution against any\ndeficiency claims that either creditor 1.m or other medical creditors who were not\nscheduled in their initial Chapter 7 petition might wish to pursue (Tr. 63-72), Applicant\nand his wife filed an amended bankruptcy petition on the date of their discharge.\nVirtually all of these medical claims were included in Applicant\u2019s initial bankruptcy\npetition and were discharged.  See Ex. A; Tr. 67-79.\nAfter the renter vacated their first home, Applicant and his wife sued in small\nclaims court for retention of the tenant\u2019s $1,000 security deposit, a month\u2019s rent, and\nadditional cleaning costs. See Exs. 3, F, and H; Tr. 59. The renter, in turn,\ncounterclaimed against Applicant and his wife for damages associated with repairs she\nmade to the property during her short tenure. Exs. 3, F, and H; Tr. 117. \nIn its initial judgment, the court hearing the respective claims of the parties ruled\nthat the renter owed Applicant and his wife the $1,000 rental deposit, the first month\u2019s\nrent of $1,167, and cleaning costs of $747, for a total award of $2,914.  In turn,  the\ncourt awarded the renter $2,167 on her counterclaim. This initial judgment allocation\nmade Applicant and his wife net judgment holders in the amount of $747.  See Exs. F\nthrough I.  \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the court hearing his rental dispute reconsidered its\nDecember 2006 judgment and entered an amended judgment in April 2007.  See Exs.\nH and I.  In its amended judgment, the court substituted respective off-setting judgments\nand deleted the net payment language in the initial December 2006 judgment. See Exs.\nF through I.  The net effect of the court\u2019s revision leaves the final result unchanged. Off-\nsetting judgments were entered that left Applicant and his wife with a net $747 award\nentitlement from the renter.  \n\n5\nBetween them, Applicant and his wife earn collectively about $86,000 a year. Ex.\nA; Tr. 109.  They estimate they have a $793 monthly remainder that can vary some\nfrom month to month. Tr. 113. With their current income, they have been able to\nmaintain possession of their second home. \nCreditor 1.n never tried to foreclose on their second home, and Applicant and his\nwife continue to negotiate a remodification agreement that would, if agreed to by the\nmortgage holder, reduce their monthly mortgage payments. See Ex. L; Tr. 88-89.\nApplicant is confident that he and his wife will be able to renegotiate their mortgage\nterms to meet their budget needs.  Tr. 90-92. He is encouraged, too, by his obtaining his\ncontractor\u2019s license in March 2010 and is currently enrolled in the contractors state\nlicense service. See Ex. C.  With his contractor\u2019s license, he hopes to attract contracting\nprojects that will enhance his income.  \nApplicant\u2019s SF-85P omissions\nAsked to complete an SF-85P application for a public trust position in July 2007,\nApplicant failed to list his creditor 1.a judgment when responding to question 19.\nApplicant attributed his omission to confusion over whether he was required to list a\njudgment that was reported in his bankruptcy petition and was subject to a net setoff in\nhis favor. Tr. 118-31. Applicant assures that he did not intend to omit any outstanding\njudgment from his questionnaire. Tr. 120.  He admitted to omitting his renter\u2019s judgment\non her cross-claim in the belief that his judgment created a net collectible judgment in\nhis favor.\nWhen first interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) in August 2008, Applicant explained the rent-related judgments\nand the circumstances surrounding them to the investigator without any prompting.  See\nEx. 3; Tr. 120-31.  There is nothing in the OPM summary to indicate that Applicant was\nshown copies of the judgments before he volunteered information about them.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his judgment omission are entirely plausible and\ncorroborated by the documented off-setting judgments. It was never his intent to falsify\nhis application or acknowledge any kind of deliberate falsification of his SF-85P when\nresponding to the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s explanations are credible and are accepted.  \nEndorsements\nApplicant is well-regarded by his supervisors and coworkers. His direct\nsupervisor for the past 13 months described Applicant as a \u201chard-working, dedicated,\nloyal, and experienced\u201d construction professional. See ex. E.  He credited Applicant with\nbeing reliable and trustworthy and an outstanding asset to his employer. \nApplicant\u2019s assistant facility manager described Applicant as a highly motivated\nand valuable member of their staff and a very reliable resource. See Ex. E. Applicant is\n\n6\npraised as well by members of the Defense Department who work with him and his\ncoworkers. \nPolicies\nThe AGs list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making\nprocess covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of\nthe \"Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\u201d\n(Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before\ndeciding whether or not a determination of eligibility to hold a public trust position\nshould be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to\nassess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the\ncontext of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  AG \u00b6 18\n\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\n             By virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's eligibility to hold a public trust position maybe made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility to hold a public trust position depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to hold or maintain\na public trust position.  The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused sensitive information before it can deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a public trust position.  Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information\nentrusted to him.  Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing\nadmitted or controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the\npurpose of establishing his or her trustworthiness through evidence of refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a conscientious and well-regarded contract bid specialist for a\ndefense contractor who accumulated numerous debts during periods of his\nunemployment and his wife\u2019s medically-related layoffs in the 2007 time frame.  With the\nlimited resources available to him and his family, he encountered considerable difficulty\nin keeping up with his accumulated debts.  Applicant has since petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, received his discharge, and is presently awaiting court-approval of his\namendment. Applicant\u2019s finances and his omission of a small judgment (subject to\noffset) in his completed SF-85P raise initial security concerns.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nTrustworthiness concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline\nof the Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended that he or she is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts, which heretofore he has not been\nin a position to address, warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s debts covered in his\ndischarged 2010 bankruptcy. Applicant and his wife both experienced prolonged job\nlosses and could not keep up with their mortgages and personal debts. MC \u00b6 20(b) of\nthe financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibility,\u201d under the circumstances, applies to Applicant\u2019 situation.\nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant and his wife following their\nloss of stead employment, they could not find any way to address their individual debts\nand petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. All of Applicant\u2019s listed debts (including\nthe off-set judgment that ensued from his dispute with his renter) were scheduled and\ndischarged.  Applicant has no known outstanding debts at this time.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s shown extenuating circumstances and demonstrated  good-\nfaith efforts to resolve his debts through preliminary financial counseling and Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief, two additional mitigating conditions under the financial considerations\nguideline are applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation: MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2018s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control.\u201d \nWhile Applicant is credited with making initial efforts to address his debts before\nelecting to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, his efforts are not enough to warrant the\napplication of MC \u00b6 20(d) of the guideline. The Appeal Board has never equated\nbankruptcy discharge with good-faith efforts to repay creditors, and has never precluded\nconsiderations of negative trust considerations from an applicant\u2019s overall financial\nhistory just because the applicant has exercised his right to seek a discharge of debts in\nbankruptcy.  See ISCR Case No. 01-27082 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 5, 2003).\nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of\nimportant fiducial responsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and\ncandor.   Financial stability in a person cleared to access information covered by privacy\n\n9\nrights is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the\ntrustworthiness determination.  Applicant meets these high fiduciary requirements.\nBoth the applicable mitigating conditions of the financial guideline and whole-\nperson assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and special circumstances as a\nstruggling provider who experienced lengthy periods of unemployment conduce to dispel\nconcerns about his reliability and trustworthiness. Taking into account all of the\nextenuating facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the\nlimited resources he has had to address them with, and the counseling and professional\nbankruptcy services he has enlisted to address his debts, he mitigates trustworthiness\nconcerns related to his debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Appellant\u2019s SF-85P \nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nalso raised initially under the personal conduct guideline, as the result of his omission of\nhis renter\u2019s judgment on her cross-claim in December 2006.  Applicant attributed his\nomission to confusion over the status of the judgment. Applicant\u2019s explanations are well\ncorroborated by the documented off-setting judgments he provided.  Once his former\ntenant\u2019s judgment on her cross-claim is off-set by Applicant\u2019s affirmative judgment for his\nsecurity deposit, rent, and clean-up charges, Applicant retains a net enforceable\njudgment of $747.  Under this set of circumstances, Applicant\u2019s claims of having no\nknown enforceable judgment against him are plausible ones.  \nBased on Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations the judgment at issue, MC \u00b6 17(f),\n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d is fully\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant\u2019s omission of the renter\u2019s judgment on her\ncross-claim is absorbed by Applicant\u2019s own judgment against his renter and deprives his\nomission of any material significance.   \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s omission explanations are persuasive enough to warrant\nconclusions the falsification allegations relative to his SF-85P omission of his neutralized\nrenter\u2019s judgment on her cross-claim are unsubstantiated. Considering all of the\nevidence produced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nGuideline E allegations that Applicant knowingly and wilfully omitted a judgment taken by\nhis renter in the SF-85P he executed in July 2007. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n10\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.o:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT \nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public\ntrust position.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has 27 accounts placed for collection or other delinquent accounts, \nwhich total in excess of $27,000. Applicant asserted, but failed to document, that some \nof the debts were included in his bankruptcy and that he was making payments on \nothers. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns \nunder financial considerations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 30, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn September 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated December 8, 2009. The FORM \ncontained 10 attachments. On December 18, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions. Responses to the \nFORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nJanuary 18, 2010. As of February 18, 2010, no response had been received. On \nFebruary 19, 2010, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \n1.e, 1.k, and 1.l. He asserts he is currently making payments on the remaining debts. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old field service engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since June 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn March 2009, when Applicant responded to written interrogatories, he included \na personal financial worksheet. (Ex. 8) It showed monthly gross income of $4,923, net \nincome of $3,520, monthly expenses of $3,209, and monthly payment on debts of $250, \nwhich left a net monthly remainder (income less expenses) of $305. (Ex. 8)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the written interrogatories, he was unfamiliar with \nthree of the medical bills. (Ex. 8) His wife contacted his previous medical insurance and \nrequested a list of all medical bills paid and unpaid. He believes there are numerous \nbills that should have been paid and were not. When the insurance company responds, \nhe will review the medical bills to see what remains unpaid. (Ex. 8) \n \n \nApplicant asserts, but provides no documentation, that he established an \nautomatic payment of $50 monthly on his student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.p, $3,217). (Ex. 8) \nApplicant owes his credit union for two repossessed vehicles (SOR \u00b6 1.t, $3,955 and \nSOR \u00b6 1.u, $10,952). In March 2009, he asserted he previously worked for the credit \nunion and the credit union suggested he work part-time to repay the debts. Applicant \nwas going to check with his current employer to determine if there was any conflict of \ninterest preventing him from being so employed. There is no evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nemployer\u2019s response or if Applicant actually began working for the credit union.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts, but again failed to document, that he contacted all of his \ncreditors, except for three, and was able to consolidate all the debts into four accounts. \nHe provided no further information about the accounts and failed to provide any \ninformation that payment had been made on the accounts.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant included in his March 2009 written response, portions of a February \n2009 on-line credit report. (Ex. 8) The credit report indicates a number of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts were included in or discharged in a bankruptcy. No bankruptcy schedules or other \nbankruptcy forms were part of the record.  \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant asserted he was going to use his anticipated tax refund \nto pay some of his debts. (Ex. 8) There is nothing in the record indicating the size of the \nrefund or showing that any of the refund was used to pay his debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence includes four credit bureau reports (CBR) dated: July 23, 2008 \n(Ex.5), December 10, 2008 (Ex. 6), June 24, 2009 (Ex. 7), and December 7, 2009 (Ex. \n9). Applicant was unemployed from March 2004 through June 2004 and January 2008 \nthrough June 2008. (Ex. 2) No further information on Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment was provided.  \n \n \nApplicant asserted that he was making payment on a number of debts. (Ex. 3) \nHe also asserted some of his debts were discharged in bankruptcy. (Ex. 8) Applicant\u2019s \nfour CBRs submitted by the government do not list any of the SOR accounts placed for \ncollection as having been in bankruptcy.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. In January 2006, Applicant had $79,351 of debt discharged in bankruptcy. \nThe SOR lists 282 accounts placed for collection or other past due indebtedness, which \ntotaled approximately $28,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s accounts placed for collection are both numerous \nand recent. Half of the debts, 14 in number, are related to medical accounts placed for \ncollection. Applicant is checking to see why his insurance did not pay these bills. The \nrecord provides no evidence of the nature of the medical services provided. There is no \nexplanation why he had two cars repossessed. He was unemployed for four months in \n2004 and six months in 2008. As the record has been presented, I am unable to find the \ndebts were incurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or that they do \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced two recent periods of unemployment, \nin 2004 and in 2008. Additionally, half of the accounts placed for collection were for \nmedical bills. However, Applicant provided no additional information about the medical \n \n2 Two of the debts listed are the same obligation. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \ncondition so that I could find it was an unexpected medical emergency. AG & 20(b) has \nonly limited application.  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply. There is no showing Applicant has received financial \ncounseling or that his debts are under control. Applicant asserts he is paying his student \nloan, is talking to the credit union about part-time employment with them to excuse his \ndebt, and asserts he is paying his other debts. He also asserted that many of the debts \nhe now states he is paying were included in his bankruptcy.  \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant asserted he had consolidated his debts into four \naccounts. Applicant\u2019s most recent CBR (Ex. 9) fails to support that any of his financial \nobligations, listed in the SOR, are being paid as agreed. Approximately a year ago, he \nsaid he would use his tax refund to pay some of the debt. He provided nothing showing \nthat he received a tax refund or how he used the refund. He failed to document, that he \nis making timely, monthly payments on the four consolidated debts, or on his student \nloan. He provided no cancelled checks, no letters from the creditors, no monthly bank \naccount statements showing monthly withdrawals for the amounts in question, no \nmonthly account balances from the creditors showing the balance owed is being \nreduced, or other evidence of payments being made. Applicant has provided insufficient \nproof that he is making timely payments. AG & 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant said he had paid the $132 cable bill (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $66 medical bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), the $49 cable bill (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and the $40 library bill (SOR \u00b6 1.k). He \nfailed to document the payments. He is not disputing any of the remaining account \nplaced for collection or other past due obligations. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his \ntruthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. Even if I found for him in these matters, there is no evidence of documentation \nto support that the delinquent debts have been paid or are being paid in a manner \nagreeable to the creditors.  \n \nApplicant was unemployed twice in the recent past and half of his debts are for \nunpaid medical bills. These events are beyond his control. However, he has been \nemployed with his current employer since June 2008, more than a year and a half. \nAlmost a year ago, Applicant stated he would contact his creditors and start repaying \nhis past due obligations, and would use his tax refund to make payment on his debts. \nThere is no evidence he has done so.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended. Should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b- 1.aa: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.cc:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that Applicant owed a debt of $16,921 in collection since about August 2007 (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, it was alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse (SOR 2.a), father and brother (SOR 2.b), and his mother-in-law (SOR 2.c), are resident citizens of Vietnam, and that Applicant was in Vietnam from December 2006 through April 2007 to marry his spouse (SOR 2.d). Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2007 e-QIP by not disclosing a 1993 felony arrest for second degree burglary and criminal conspiracy (SOR 3.a), and a 1994 arrest for assault with a firearm on his person (SOR 3.b), and by not disclosing the loan debt in SOR 1.a in response to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR 3.c). Applicant admitted the allegations, although he clarified at his hearing that he did not intentionally lie about his arrest record. He explained that he had not known that there were any offenses on his record when he completed his e-QIP. (Tr. 55.) After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant was born in Vietnam in August 1973. (Ex. 1.) He left Vietnam for the 3 Phillippines as a refugee when he was nine or ten with his grandmother and some aunts and uncles. (Tr. 131-32.)

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s spouse, father, brother, and parents-in-law are resident citizens of\nVietnam as of January 2010. Applicant applied for his spouse to immigrate to the United\nStates, but foreign influence concerns are not yet fully mitigated. Financial concerns\nraised by delinquent debt of about $20,000, including a collection balance of $17,169,\nare not mitigated. Applicant lacks the funds to resolve the debt in the near future and a\nlonger track record of payments is required to demonstrate financial responsibility.\nPersonal conduct concerns because of Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose two old arrests,\nand any financial delinquencies, on his e-QIP are not established because he lacked the\nintent to conceal. Clearance is denied.\n                           \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on October 15, 2007. On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, Guideline B, Foreign\nInfluence, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary\nJune 15, 2010\n\nApplicant indicated he did not want a hearing on the Guideline F and Guideline B issues, but they\n1\nwere discussed during the hearing conducted on December 9, 2009.\nSee Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2008: Vietnam, Feb. 25, 2009, Background Note:\n2\nVietnam, Oct. 2009, Country Specific Information: Vietnam, Aug. 28, 2009, and CRS Report for Congress:\nU.S.-Vietnam Relations in 2009: Current Issues and Implications for U.S. Policy, Feb. 5, 2009. W hile a\ndecision in this case was pending, the State Department issued updated information about Vietnam. See 2009\nHuman Rights Reports: Vietnam, Mar. 11, 2010, and Background Note: Vietnam, May 27, 2010. A review of\nthe updated information confirms the strong economic relationship between the United States and Vietnam\nas well as ongoing U.S. concerns about human rights abuses in Vietnam.\n2\ndecision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 29, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing on the Guideline E concerns.  On October 27, 2009, the case was assigned to\n1\nme with a motion for administrative notice pending from the Government. On November\n6, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for December 9, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) were\nadmitted into evidence without an objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits (Ex. A-B)\nthat were also entered without an objection, and he testified, as reflected in a transcript\n(Tr.) received on December 17, 2009. I also agreed to take administrative notice of\npertinent facts about Vietnam.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until December 30, 2009, for\nadditional documentation. On December 18, 2009, Applicant timely submitted a record\nof the payments made on the loan debt in SOR 1.a, and his billing statements for\nanother loan with the same bank (not alleged in SOR). The Government did not object,\nand the documents were marked and entered as Exhibits C and D, respectively.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn October 22, 2009, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) and its\nforeign relations, including with the United States. The request was based on\npublications from the U.S. State Department and the Congressional Research Service.2\nThe government\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. \nOn November 20, 2009, I notified the parties of my intention to take\nadministrative notice of pertinent facts as requested by the Government, subject to\n\nApplicant apparently was born in what was then the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He\n3\nmarried his current spouse in a city south of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). (Ex. A.)\nThe Government presented no police or court documents to shed light on the particular criminal\n4\nstatutes at issue. Under Section 461 of the state\u2019s penal code, burglary in the second degree is punishable\nby imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison. Section 496 pertinent to\nreceiving stolen property states as follows:\n(a) Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been\nobtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen\nor obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding\nany property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be\n3\nrevision based on the evidence admitted at the hearing and any valid objections raised\nby Applicant. Before the introduction of any evidence at his hearing, Applicant indicated\nthat he had no objections. I agreed to take administrative notice of particular facts\npertaining to Vietnam and its relations with the United States, as set forth below.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that Applicant\nowed a debt of $16,921 in collection since about August 2007 (SOR 1.a). Under\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence, it was alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse (SOR 2.a), father\nand brother (SOR 2.b), and his mother-in-law (SOR 2.c), are resident citizens of\nVietnam, and that Applicant was in Vietnam from December 2006 through April 2007 to\nmarry his spouse (SOR 2.d). Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was\nalleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2007 e-QIP by not disclosing a 1993\nfelony arrest for second degree burglary and criminal conspiracy (SOR 3.a), and a 1994\narrest for assault with a firearm on his person (SOR 3.b), and by not disclosing the loan\ndebt in SOR 1.a in response to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on\nany debts (SOR 3.c). \nApplicant admitted the allegations, although he clarified at his hearing that he did\nnot intentionally lie about his arrest record. He explained that he had not known that\nthere were any offenses on his record when he completed his e-QIP. (Tr. 55.) After\nconsidering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in Vietnam in August 1973.  (Ex. 1.) He left Vietnam for the\n3\nPhillippines as a refugee when he was nine or ten with his grandmother and some aunts\nand uncles. (Tr. 131-32.) Applicant\u2019s parents and two brothers remained in Vietnam.\nWhile Applicant was living in a refugee camp in the Phillippines, he was adopted by a\ncouple in the United States. His grandmother immigrated separately to the United\nStates, and eventually Applicant went to live with her. (Tr. 134-35.) Before junior high\nschool, Applicant moved in with an aunt and uncle. He stayed with them until he\ngraduated from high school in June 1993. (Tr. 136.) In May 1993, Applicant was\narrested for second degree burglary and criminal conspiracy. He lent his vehicle to a\nfriend to buy beer. Sometime later, as Applicant was driving this friend home, they were\npulled over and the police found stolen property in the vehicle. The charges against\nApplicant were later amended to receiving known stolen property and dismissed.4\n\npunished by imprisonment in a state prison, or in a county jail for not more than one year.\nHowever, if the district attorney or the grand jury determines that this action would be in the\ninterests of justice, the district attorney or the grand jury, as the case may be, may, if the\nvalue of the property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), specify in the\naccusatory pleading that the offense shall be a misdemeanor, punishable only by\nimprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year. A principal in the actual theft of the\nproperty may be convicted pursuant to this section. However, no person may be convicted\nboth pursuant to this section and of the theft of the same property.\nAccording to the I-130 petition that Applicant filed for his current spouse to immigrate to the United\n5\nStates, his first marriage ended in divorce in November 2005. Applicant married his first wife in Vietnam in\nApril 1998, and had sponsored his first wife\u2019s immigration to the United States in March 1999. (Ex. A.) \n4\nApplicant denies knowing that there was any stolen property in his vehicle or that he\nhad been charged with a felony offense. (Ex. 3, Tr. 111.) \nAfter high school, Applicant attended a junior college for about 18 months. (Tr.\n136.) In November 1993, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. 1.) In July 1994, he\nwas working at a movie theater when he got involved in an argument with a coworker,\nwhom Applicant felt was not doing his share of the cleaning duties. Applicant threatened\nthe coworker, who complained to the police that Applicant had assaulted him with a\nfirearm. Applicant denies he had a firearm or other weapon on him (Ex. 3, Tr. 112-13),\nand the available record does not show otherwise.\nIn about July 1995, Applicant moved to his current state of residence. (Ex. 1, Tr.\n137-38.) In May 1997, he began working as a machinist for a local company. (Ex. 1, A.)\nIn August 1997, Applicant was issued his U.S. passport. (Ex. A.) Sometime before\n2000, Applicant\u2019s mother emigrated from Vietnam to the United States under Applicant\u2019s\nsponsorship. Applicant\u2019s parents were separated, and his father did not want to\nimmigrate to the Untied States (Tr. 138.), so Applicant traveled to Vietnam to visit his\nfather about once a year. (Tr. 129.) Applicant\u2019s mother acquired U.S. citizenship through\nnaturalization in June 2005. (Ex. 1.)\nIn mid-2005, Applicant, who was married to his first wife at the time,  began\n5\ncorresponding via the Internet with a Vietnamese farmer, who would eventually become\nhis second wife. As their friendship progressed, they had once weekly contact by\ntelephone. (Ex. A.) Around late 2005 or early 2006, the elder of Applicant\u2019s two brothers\nin Vietnam passed away, leaving a spouse and two small children. (Tr. 69, 125.)\nApplicant traveled to Vietnam in January 2006. He paid for the trip with savings from his\nemployment in the United States. (Tr. 87-88.) Applicant arranged to meet his future\nspouse at her sister\u2019s home in Vietnam in February 2006. (Ex. A.) He gave his father\nand brother\u2019s widow some money before he left. (Tr. 124-25.)\nAfter Applicant returned to the United States in late February 2006, Applicant and\nhis future spouse had telephone contact on average three times per week. (Ex. A.) By\nabout the fall of 2006, they were discussing marriage. Planning a trip to Vietnam to\npropose in December 2006, Applicant took out a loan from a bank in the U.S. in\nSeptember 2006 (SOR 1.a) to pay for his trip and to provide financial support for his\nrelatives in Vietnam. He recalls the original loan amount was $10,000 (Tr. 71, 74, 77-\n\nApplicant indicated on his e-QIP that they married in March 2007, which was the date the Vietnamese\n6\nauthorities registered their marriage.\n5\n78), although available credit reports show a high credit of $15,620. (Ex. 4, 5, 6.) In\nOctober 2006, he borrowed $3,000 from a $3,500 line of credit. (Ex. D.) In November\n2006, Applicant was laid off from the job he had held for nine years. (Ex. 1, A.) Applicant\ncollected $488 per week in unemployment compensation for four weeks until he\ntraveled to Vietnam in December 2006 to propose marriage. (Ex. A.) He testified he\nmade payments on both loans until he lost his job (Tr. 79.), although he had taken out\nthe line of credit only the month before.\nApplicant and his spouse celebrated a traditional wedding in Vietnam in late\nDecember 2006, with both families present. It took three months to register their\nmarriage with civil authorities in Vietnam.  (Ex. 1, A.) From late December until he\n6\nreturned to the United States in April 2007, Applicant stayed with his spouse at her\nfamily\u2019s home for the most part. (Ex. A.) He spent $8,200 on his wedding, and $1,200\nfor his plane ticket, but gave a substantial portion of the money he borrowed from the\nU.S. banks to his relatives in Vietnam. (Tr. 77-78.) On May 2, 2007, Applicant applied\nfor his spouse to immigrate to the United States. (Ex. A.)\nApplicant made no payments on his loans when he was in Vietnam, and in\nFebruary 2007, the lender identified in SOR 1.a placed a delinquent balance of $15,620\nfor collection. He paid $445 on the line of credit debt on April 25, 2007 (Ex. D.), but he\nwas out of work collecting unemployment at $445 per week, so he made no further\npayments. His account was past due in the amount of $356 as of October 2007. (Ex. 4,\n5, 6. D.)\nIn October 2007, Applicant began working for his present employer, a defense\ncontractor, as an assembler at an hourly wage of about $11. (Ex. 1, Tr. 66.) Applicant\nwas asked by his employer to complete an e-QIP, which he assumed was for his\nemployment. He did not fully appreciate that it was for a security clearance. (Tr. 95,\n107.) On his October 15, 2007, e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that his father, brother, and\nspouse were resident citizens of Vietnam, and that he had traveled to Vietnam for\npleasure from December 2006 to April 2007. Applicant responded negatively to the\npolice record inquiries, including whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of\nany felony offense, and whether he had been charged with or convicted of a firearms or\nexplosives offense. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the financial delinquency questions about\nwhether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the last seven\nyears, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. Applicant\nbelieved he had been charged with misdemeanor offenses in the two incidents in the\nearly 1990s (Tr. 111, 116), did not have a firearm on him when he threatened his\ncoworker in 1994 (Tr. 112.), and that he did not owe a past due balance that would fall\nwithin the scope of the inquiries since he planned to pay back the bank (Tr. 110-11.).\nApplicant was granted an interim Confidential security clearance. (Tr. 103.)\nApplicant began making the monthly minimum payments of $89 on his line of\ncredit account (not alleged in SOR) in late November 2007, but late fees continued to\n\n6\naccumulate. Payments made of $89 in January and February 2008 were returned due\nto insufficient funds. While he continued to pay $89 on the account, a late fee of $49\nwas added each month because his account was past due. In late June 2008, he began\npaying $100 per month on the account, which was $5 less than the current payment\ndue. He was notified in January 2009 that his account was scheduled to be written off\nbecause it was $603 past due. As of February 2009, his account was considered\ncurrent, although there is no evidence that he paid the past due balance. As of August\n2009, his account was $25 past due because he had been paying $100 each month\nwhen the current payment due was $105. He brought the account current in September\n2009, and increased his monthly payment thereafter to $105. As of November 2009, the\nbalance on the account was $3,284.30. In December 2009, he authorized the lender to\nautomatically debit $105 from his account each month through November 2010. (Ex. D.)\nOn January 10, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout the debt in SOR 1.a. He acknowledged that he had stopped making payments on\nthe account, but he denied it was in collection. He related that he just began making $90\npayments on the loan, which he was unaware had to be disclosed on his e-QIP. (Ex. 2.)\nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he was making $50 and $100 payments on his\ntwo accounts (debt in SOR 1.a and credit line) when he got his job with his current\nemployer, and that in December 2009, he increased his monthly payment to where he\nwas paying $100 on both loans. (Tr. 80-82.) The collection agency\u2019s summary of\npayments on the account in SOR 1.a shows $50 monthly payments only in 2009. (Ex.\nC.) As of December 10, 2009, his account had a collection balance of $17,169.65. (Ex.\nC.)\nOn July 18, 2008, Applicant was interviewed about his family members in\nVietnam. He indicated he had daily telephone contact with his spouse, who is a rice\nfarmer, and he was saving the funds to bring her to the United States. Applicant\ntelephoned his father, who worked as a taxi driver, once every two or three months. He\nhad heard that his brother was traveling to Cambodia for work, but their contact was\nlimited to once or twice a year. As for his in-laws, Applicant did not mention his father-in-\nlaw, but he indicated that his mother-in-law was a homemaker and resided with\nApplicant\u2019s spouse. Applicant expressed no problems or difficulties with Vietnamese\nauthorities during his stay in the country from December 2006 through April 2007. In\nFebruary 2009, Applicant provided DOHA with the full names of his parents-in-law. (Ex.\n2.)\nOn July 24, 2008, U.S. immigration notified Applicant that he had to complete an\naffidavit of financial support in order to continue processing the visa petition for his\nspouse. In January 2009, Applicant submitted a letter from his current employer\nattesting to his full-time employment at an annual income of $28,579.20. On January\n14, 2009, U.S. consular officials in Vietnam denied an immigrant visa to Applicant\u2019s\nspouse because of inadequate documentation showing the spousal relationship and a\ndetailed chronology (time line) of their relationship. Applicant provided a copy of his\nmarriage certificate, but his notarized statement contained insufficient detail to grant the\nvisa. On July 11, 2009, he submitted additional documentation, including a more\ndetailed chronology of his relationship with his spouse (Ex. A.), and she was interviewed\n\n7\nby U.S. Consular officials in Vietnam in the summer of 2009. As of December 2009, he\nwas awaiting a decision from U.S. immigration on his visa petition for his spouse\u2019s\nimmigration. (Tr. 141.)\nAs of mid-December 2009, Applicant\u2019s spouse was still residing in Vietnam with\nher parents. Applicant had daily telephone contact with his wife. Her father was\nemployed as a rice farmer. Applicant\u2019s spouse has two sisters, one of whom had\nrecently immigrated to the United States. (Tr. 118-22). In late November or early\nDecember 2009, Applicant sent his spouse $400. (Tr. 127.) Applicant has not been in\nVietnam since 2007. (Tr. 140.) His spouse and her parents have never traveled to the\nUnited States. (Tr. 127.)\nApplicant sends his father money when he can afford to do so. (Tr. 124.)\nApplicant\u2019s father works at a construction site as a type of security guard after work\nhours. (Tr. 140.) In early November 2009, he sent his father $200, which Applicant\u2019s\nfather and brother were to share if his brother was around. (Tr. 126-27.) As of\nDecember 2009, Applicant\u2019s mother was a U.S. resident citizen. Applicant had not\nspoken to his mother in over a year after they argued. (Tr. 123, 139.) His mother\nsponsored his brother for immigration to the United States and was waiting for official\naction on the petition. (Tr. 139.)\nApplicant has no financial assets in Vietnam. (Tr. 128.) As of December 2009, he\nhad about $100 in his checking account and $800 in savings in the United States. (Tr.\n83.) His currently hourly wage is $16.18. (Tr. 64.)\nApplicant has been a productive employer for the defense contractor, initially as\nan assembler, then in the materials\u2019 department. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant learned quickly\non the job, and was able to work independently within a short period of time. In the\nopinion of a support engineer who acted as his supervisor on occasion, Applicant\noutperformed his coworkers during the year that he was employed in the materials\u2019\narea. In July 2009, Applicant\u2019s interim clearance was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR\n(Tr. 143-44), and he was transferred to the facilities operation department where he did\nnot require a security clearance for his duties. Applicant continued to demonstrate\nfavorable work ethic and attention to detail. He has the support of supervisory personnel\nand coworkers, who have found him to be a conscientious worker and good team\nmember. (Ex. B)\nConcerning facts for administrative notice, Vietnam is single party, constitutional\nrepublic ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. Adherence to ideological orthodoxy\nhas become less important than economic development, but the Vietnamese\ngovernment holds a tight rein over most sectors of the economy through large state-\nowned economic enterprises and much of the banking system. China reestablished full\ndiplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1991, and China remains its largest trading partner,\nalthough tensions have periodically flared between the two countries over maritime\nclaims in the South China Sea.\n\n8\nVietnam has made a concerted effort to adjust its foreign relations to reflect the\nevolving international economic and political situation in Southeast Asia. Vietnam is a\nmember of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development\nBank, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The United States formally\nrecognized diplomatic relations with Vietnam in July 1995, and relations between the\ncountries have become increasingly cooperative and broad-based. In December 2006,\nthe United States granted Vietnam unconditional normal trade relations status, and the\nUnited States is now Vietnam\u2019s second largest trading partner. The United States and\nVietnam engage in a wide range of cooperative activities in the areas of peacekeeping,\nhumanitarian assistance and disaster relief, search and rescue, maritime and border\nsecurity, law enforcement, and non proliferation. Vietnam is one of the largest recipients\nof U.S. assistance in East Asia.\nThe two countries hold an annual dialogue on human rights, although tensions\nremain regarding some human rights issues. Vietnam permits most forms of personal\nand religious expression while repressing individuals and organizations it deems a\nthreat to the Communist Party\u2019s monopoly on power. Suppression of political dissent in\nVietnam has been criticized by successive U.S. administrations. The Vietnamese\ngovernment continues to prohibit its citizens from changing their government. Several\npolitical activists were arrested in 2008, and prominent newspaper editors and reporters\nwere fired for reporting on official corruption. Individuals continued to be detained\narbitrarily for political activities, and denied the right to fair and expeditious trials,\nalthough in 2009, the central government granted amnesty to approximately 20,000\nprisoners, most of whom had ordinary criminal convictions. The amnesty in advance of\nthe Tet holiday included a well-known journalist, a democratic party activist, and a land\nrights protester, but several high-profile dissidents remained in prison. Corruption\namong the police at all levels remains a significant problem.\nIn 2009, the government continued to limit citizens\u2019 privacy rights and tightened\ncontrols over the press and freedom of speech, assembly, movement, and association.\nControl over media content is ensured through pervasive self-censorship, backed by the\nthreat of dismissal and possible arrest. Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, which is\nresponsible for internal security in the country, maintains a system of household\nregistration and block wardens to monitor the population. While the system has\ngenerally become less intrusive, it is used to monitor those suspected of engaging in\nunauthorized political activity. Police ignored laws against forced entry into homes, and\nremoved personal computers, cell phones, and other materials from homes of\nprominent dissidents. Government authorities opened and censored targeted persons\u2019\nmail, confiscated packages and letters, monitored telephone conversations, e-mail, text\nmessages, and fax transmissions, and cut the telephone lines and interrupted cellular\nphone and Internet service of some political activists and their family members.\nInternet access is permitted only through a limited number of state-owned\nInternet service providers. Firms such as cyber-cafes are required to register the\npersonal information of their customers and store records of Internet sites visited by\ncustomers. However, not all such businesses were in compliance. The Vietnamese\n\n9\ngovernment used firewalls to block some web sites that it deemed politically or culturally\ninappropriate.\nThe Vietnamese government requires foreign passport holders to register to stay\nin private homes, although in 2009, there were no known cases of local authorities\nrefusing to allow foreign visitors to stay with friends and family. Citizens must register\nwith local police when staying overnight in any location outside of their own homes.\nForeign visitors are required to register their stay in hotels with the local police. Citizens\nwho had emigrated abroad are generally permitted to return to visit Vietnam, except in\nthe case of certain activists living abroad. By law, the government considers anyone\nborn to at least one Vietnamese citizen to be a citizen of Vietnam. Emigrants who\nacquire another country\u2019s citizenship are generally considered Vietnamese citizens\nunless they formally renounce their Vietnamese citizenship. In 2008, the country passed\nlegislation allowing for dual citizenship, and the trend liberalizing travel restrictions for\noverseas Vietnamese continued in 2009. U.S. citizens in Vietnam have been detained\nand arrested for political activities (including criticizing the government or advocating\nalternatives to Communist Party rule). Despite a 1994 agreement between the United\nStates and Vietnam that provides for the immediate notification of and reciprocal access\nwithin 96 hours to each other\u2019s detained citizens, U.S. consular officers are rarely\nnotified in a timely manner when a U.S. citizen is arrested or detained, especially when\nthe Vietnamese government considers the person to be a Vietnamese citizen.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under\n\n10\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion when\nseeking to obtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern for finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant took out two loans, including the debt in SOR 1.a, to pay for a trip to\nVietnam from December 2006 until late April 2007. He testified that he made payments\non both loans before he lost his job in November 2006 (Tr. 79.). Assuming that he made\na couple of payments on the debt in SOR 1.a, he allowed both loans to become\nseriously delinquent while he was in Vietnam from December 2006 until late April 2007.\nThe debt in SOR 1.a was placed for collection with a balance of $15,620. Billing records\nof the line of credit account (not alleged in the SOR) show the account as $445 past due\nas of May 2007. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply, given the recency of the\ndelinquencies. While he paid the $445 past due balance on the line of credit account in\nApril 2007, the account was again past due as of January 2009, in the amount of $603.\n\n11\n(Ex. D.) He presented no proof of payments on the debt in SOR 1.a before January\n2009. (See Ex. C.).\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\u201d applies in the\nabsence of any evidence that Applicant knew he was going to be laid off in November\n2006 when he took out the large loan to travel to Vietnam for his proposal and wedding.\nHe was also unemployed after he returned from Vietnam until October 2007. While one\nhas to question his expenditure of $8,200 in borrowed funds for a wedding in Vietnam\nwhen he did not have a job to return to in the United States, he does not exhibit a\npattern of spending beyond his means. Low income when he started with the defense\ncontractor (about $11 an hour) explains his failure to address the debt in SOR 1.a in a\ntimely manner.\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is pertinent because he started repaying the credit line debt\nat $89 per month in late November 2007. While the payments on his account in late\nJanuary 2008, in early February 2008, and July 2008, were returned, he continued to\nmake monthly payments of at least $100 per month. None of the subsequent payments\nwere returned. As of mid-February 2009, the creditor no longer reported his account as\npast due. Around January 2009, he had made repayment arrangements with the\ncreditor in SOR 1.a to repay that debt at $50 per month, and as reflected in Exhibit C,\nthose promised payments were made.\nDespite these payments, the balances of the two loans have not been reduced\nbelow their original obligations because of late and over limit fees, interest on the\nunpaid balances, and in the case of the loan on his line of credit, returned check\ncharges.  As of December 2009, he owed $17,169.65 on the debt in SOR 1.a and about\n$3,000 on the line of credit account. Given his promised payments of $105 monthly on\nthe line of credit debt, and $50 monthly on the debt in SOR 1.a, the debts are not likely\nto be resolved in the near future. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d does not require that debts be paid in full, but it would be\npremature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) given his income and the debt balance. Should Applicant\ncontinue to make his monthly payments, he may be able to mitigate the financial\nconcerns when he is again eligible to apply for a security clearance one year from the\ndate of this decision. \nForeign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\nSee Vietnam, Country Specific Information, Aug. 28, 2009.\n7\n12\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant immigrated to the United States as a child from his native Vietnam.\nDespite his consistent residency, citizenship, education, and employment in the United\nStates, he maintains strong ties to family members in Vietnam. He provides financial\nsupport to his father. He visited him about once a year up until his latest trip in\nDecember 2006. After the elder of his two brothers in Vietnam passed away, Applicant\ntraveled to Vietnam in January 2006 and gave his brother\u2019s widow some money as well.\nApplicant began corresponding with a Vietnamese national by Internet, met her in\nperson for the first time in February 2006, and returned to Vietnam to marry her in\nDecember 2006. He borrowed substantial sums in the United States to travel to\nVietnam, pay for his wedding, and support his father and spouse in Vietnam. Since he\nreturned to the United States in April 2007, Applicant has maintained regular telephone\ncontact with his spouse and with his father. Applicant\u2019s ties to his native Vietnam are\nsignificant, and raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies. \nApplicant testified that in 2006, he rented a hotel room and brought his family\nmembers to stay with him there. (Tr. 129.) The U.S. State Department reports that\nhotels in Vietnam require that foreigners present their passports upon check-in so that\ntheir stay can be registered with the local police, and that every guest in a hotel room\nmust be registered.  There is no evidence that Applicant encountered any difficulties\n7\nwith Vietnamese authorities, including customs or law enforcement, during his trips to\nVietnam. AG \u00b6 7(i), \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may\nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country,\u201d applies because his contacts with his family\nmembers (spouse, father, brother when available, parents-in-law) in Vietnam, which\nincludes recent and ongoing financial support, raise the risk of undue foreign influence,\nbut those contacts are more aptly covered under AG \u00b6 7(a).\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d cannot be fully applied.\nThere is nothing about the positions or activities of Applicant\u2019s father, brother, spouse,\nor in-laws, that raise concerns of foreign influence. As of July 2008, Applicant\u2019s father\nwas driving a taxi in Vietnam. By December 2009, he was working in security at a\n\n13\nconstruction site. Applicant\u2019s brother was working in Cambodia for a stepfather.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse and her father were rice farmers, while her mother was a\nhomemaker. None of Applicant\u2019s or his spouse\u2019s family members (including her three\nsiblings, one of whom recently moved to the United States) had any known connections\nto the Vietnamese government or military. That said, common sense suggests that the\nstronger the ties of affection or obligation to foreign nationals, the more vulnerable a\nperson is to being manipulated or influenced. The closeness of the spousal and paternal\nbonds make it more, rather than less, likely that Applicant will be placed in an untenable\nposition of having to choose between the interests of these foreign family members and\nthe interests of the United States. Moreover, while relations between Vietnam and the\nUnited States have improved considerably since the mid-1990s, the risk of coercion,\npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian\ngovernment, or a record of human rights abuses. Vietnam is a one-party state with\npower concentrated in the Communist Party. Although there has been a favorable trend\ntoward more religious freedom in Vietnam, the government continues to suppress\npolitical dissent and challenges to its authority, to detain persons arbitrarily, to control\npublic access to information through the Internet and the press, and to monitor and\ninterfere with correspondence of targeted individuals. While there is no indication that\nVietnamese authorities have targeted Applicant\u2019s relatives or Applicant during his stay\nthere, registration requirements for foreign visitors and Vietnamese citizens make it\neasier for the government to monitor and track activities and associations.\nAs of the close of the record in January 2010, Applicant\u2019s spouse had not been\napproved to immigrate to the United States. A grant of her visa would lessen, but not\neliminate, the foreign influence concerns. In addition to the bonds with his father, who\ndoes not want to immigrate to the United States, Applicant would also still be at risk\nthrough his spouse\u2019s bond with her parents in Vietnam. See AG \u00b6 7(d) (stating, \u201csharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d). Should his spouse join him in the United States, she is likely to contact her\nparents out of affection and for reassurance as she attempts to familiarize herself with a\nforeign culture while Applicant is at work. Applicant testified that his spouse and her\nparents had never been to the United States. (Tr. 127.)\nFurthermore, while Applicant has been a law-abiding citizen of the U.S. for the\npast 15 years, I cannot apply AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s loyalties to his relatives in Vietnam\ncannot reasonably be characterized as minimal. Even though all of his financial assets,\nmost notably his employment income, are in the United States, his strongest personal\nrelations appear to be in Vietnam. Applicant sponsored his mother\u2019s U.S. immigration,\nbut he and his mother argued and they have not been on speaking terms in over a year.\nBoth of his marriages were to Vietnamese native citizens in Vietnam.\n\n14\nApplicant has not returned to Vietnam while his petition for his spouse\u2019s\nimmigration has been pending U.S. approval. He speaks with his brother only if his\nbrother happens to be around when he calls his father. But the frequency of his\ncommunications with his spouse and his father do not permit application of AG \u00b6 8(c),\n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d The foreign\ninfluence concerns are not sufficiently mitigated.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is the failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant did not disclose any arrests or financial delinquencies on his October\n2007 e-QIP. The Government submits that Applicant was required to disclose that he\nhad been charged with second degree burglary, and with criminal conspiracy in about\n1993, in response to question 23.a regarding any felony charges (SOR 3.a). Applicant\nexpressed his belief that he was arrested for minor or misdemeanor offenses, which\nwould have fallen outside of the scope of question 23. The Government cited no\nstatutory authority, and presented no arrest or court records, that would substantiate its\nassertion that Applicant was charged with a felony offense. The state\u2019s penal code\nprovision covering second degree burglary does not specifically characterize the\noffense as a felony or misdemeanor. The charges were later amended to a single count\nof receiving stolen property, which carries a similar penalty to second degree burglary,\ni.e., imprisonment in country jail not exceeding one year or in state prison. But the penal\ncode also provides that if the value of the stolen property does not exceed $950, the\ncrime may be a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in county jail not\nexceeding one year. Based on the record before me for review, I find that the\nGovernment did not establish its case for knowing falsification of question 23.a.\nConcerning Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose his arrest in 1994 for assault\nwith a firearm in response to question 23.b (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of a firearms or explosives offense?\u201d) (SOR 3.b), the Government presented\nonly Applicant\u2019s accounts of the incident to substantiate its case for knowingly\nfalsification. In response to DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing Applicant denied\nthat he had a firearm. In the absence of credible evidence contradicting Applicant\u2019s\ndenial, I cannot find a knowing and willful falsification of question 23.b.\nThe evidence shows that Applicant was more than 90 days delinquent on the\ndebt in SOR 1.a when he completed his e-QIP in October 2007 (SOR 3.c), so the debt\nshould have been disclosed on his security clearance application in response to\n\nThese factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\n8\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n15\nquestion 28.b. Applicant testified that since he was repaying the bank, he did not realize\nthat he was required to list the debt. The record does not substantiate that he made\npayments on that loan before 2009. As for the other loan from his line of credit account,\nhe made one payment of $445 in late April 2007, but he was over 90 days past due as\nof October 2007. When he was interviewed on January 10, 2008, Applicant indicated\nthat he stopped payment on the debt in SOR 1.a about seven months before his\ninterview, which would correspond to the record of payments on the credit line loan.\nWhile he has failed to differentiate between the two loans at times, he knew that he had\nnot made any payments to the bank during the summer and into the fall of 2007 when\nhe was unemployed. His full-time employment in October 2007 was likely the impetus\nfor him resuming payments to the bank in late November 2007, as reflected in Exhibit D.\nHowever, it is unclear whether he understood that he was required to disclose\nthat debt in response to question 28.b. During his January 2008 interview, he indicated\nthat he did not realize that he had to list the debt. He intended to repay his loans to the\nbank as soon as he was able, and he resumed paying on the credit line loan the month\nafter he started working for the defense contractor. Applicant was not familiar with the\nsecurity clearance process, as evidenced by his belief that he completed the form for\nhis employment and not for a security clearance. He also discussed the debts during his\ninterview in January 2008, and asserted then that he was unaware that he had to list the\ndebt on his e-QIP. I conclude he lacked the knowing and willful intent that would warrant\napplication of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a\nsource of questionable reliability,\u201d applies to the issue of whether Applicant had the\nintent to conceal.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a).  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\n8\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWork references are consistent in extolling Applicant\u2019s contributions on the job,\nhis ability to work independently, and his value as a team member. But they are not\n\n16\nsufficient to overcome the foreign influence concerns that exist because of his strong\nbonds to his spouse, father, and other Vietnamese resident citizens. He is indebted\nabout $20,000 on two bank loans that he obtained to travel to Vietnam to propose to his\ncurrent wife, to pay for his wedding, and to support his family members (spouse and\nfather primarily) in Vietnam. The loan amounts were sizeable in relation to his income\nand available assets. While he may not have foreseen the loss of his employment, it\nwas his decision to continue with his plan to propose to his spouse in Vietnam, and\nwithin weeks, they had a ceremony that cost him about $8,200. He made no effort to\npay on his loans while he was in Vietnam, and gave his family members the balance\nremaining after he paid for his travel and wedding. After he returned to the United\nStates in April 2007, he applied for his spouse to immigrate to the United States, but\napproval has been delayed in part because he did not adequately document his\nrelationship with her. He also showed questionable judgment in making three payments\non his loans in 2008 when he apparently did not have the funds to cover the amounts.\nApplicant made regular, monthly payments on both loans in 2009, and he\nprovided U.S. Consular officials with information that may lead to an approval of his\nspouse\u2019s immigration. But without more progress toward reduction of the debt, and\nwithout sufficiently strong ties in the United States to counter the foreign influence\nconcerns, I am unable at this time to find that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. Certainly, relations between\nthe United States and Vietnam have improved, especially in trade and economic issues.\nYet, even the best of allies do not always share the same interests, and Applicant has\nnot persuaded me that he can be counted on to make decisions free of any concern for\nhis relatives in Vietnam.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n17\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSamuel Bluck, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 19, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\n\nThe record was kept open for a period after the hearing for the receipt of additional documentary evidence.\n1\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems began in 2004 when his sister and mother were incarcerated.  He provided $3,000\ntoward his mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.  He had previously signed a note for a $41,000 automobile for\nhis sister with the understanding that she would make monthly payments to him.  In 2004,\nApplicant\u2019s sister lost her job and stopped making payments to Applicant.  Also in 2004, Applicant\npurchased a pick-up truck for $13,000 and an SUV for $27,000.  The combined annual salary of\nApplicant and his wife at the time was $78,000.  After two months, Applicant stopped making\npayments on his sister\u2019s car as it was interfering with his ability to pay his other debts.  The car was\nrepossessed and sold with a balance of $11,000 remaining to be paid.  Applicant made no other\npayments on the debt and after five years passed, the debt grew to $20,550.  The payments on\nApplicant\u2019s other two vehicles fell delinquent as well, but he managed to work out an agreement\nwith the creditors.  Applicant recently retired the loans on these vehicles.  Applicant also fell behind\non his payments on several credit card accounts.  \nIn 2007 Applicant received $24,286 from the sale of a home.  He had anticipated using the\nmoney to pay his debts.  However, he had to make a $18,000 down payment on a new home.\nApplicant was able to pay off two debts with the remainder, but other delinquencies remained.\nApplicant incurred a $5,000 debt to furnish the new house.  Applicant is current on the debt but still\nowes $1,400.  Applicant was able to settle two credit card debts by getting the creditors to accept less\nthan the full amount owed.  Applicant settled these accounts by means of a $5,000 loan.  In 2009,\nApplicant contacted and received financial counseling from a consumer credit counseling service.\nWhile he is now current on his mortgage and ten other accounts, Applicant has not paid on two\noutstanding delinquent debts in the aggregate amount of $16,700.  In October 2008 Applicant stated\nhe wanted to repay the debt, and he restated this intent at the hearing.  Following the hearing,\nApplicant\u2019s counsel indicated that the debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report.   No\n1\nindication of a repayment plan or the establishment of a repayment plan has been received. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s debts are a continuing course of conduct.  Two\ncreditors were not paid until after the hearing, and two debts (with one creditor) remain unpaid, with\nno evidence of a repayment plan.  Applicant\u2019s numerous debts were not incurred under unusual\ncircumstances.  Applicant\u2019s unexpected debts when he paid his mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and his\nsister\u2019s car liability were beyond his control for which he deserves some mitigation.  However, these\nevents occurred in 2004.  Subsequently, Applicant\u2019s household income was between $78,000 and\n$95,000, and it has been more than five years since the events.  Applicant did not act responsibly\nunder the circumstances.  Since there is no clear indication that the remaining debts are being\nresolved, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.\nApplicant asserts that, contrary to the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, he has acted\nresponsibly regarding his outstanding debts given his circumstances.  He argues that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision contained an insufficient articulation and unsatisfactory explanation of financially\nirresponsible behavior.  He notes that a plan for immediate or simultaneous repayment of all debts\n\nis not required and all that is required is that he act responsibly and develop a reasonable plan for\nrepayment accompanied by concomitant conduct.  Applicant argues that the record shows that he has\nsatisfied this requirement.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of the mitigating factors listed under Guideline\nF and indicated in some detail why some mitigating conditions did not apply and why others only\npartially applied and why those partial applications did not ultimately mitigate the financial concerns\nraised in the case.  Reading the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge\ndecided that Applicant had no reasonable plan for repaying his outstanding debts, given the fact that\nApplicant had indicated his intent to pay on earlier occasions and had not followed through.  The\nJudge also noted that in a post-hearing statement, Applicant drew attention to the absence of the\noutstanding debts on a recent credit report.  These facts led the Judge to doubt whether Applicant\ngenuinely intended to satisfy the past due obligations.  This conclusion was reasonable given the\nrecord evidence.  In other parts of the decision, the Judge also questioned why certain debts of\nApplicant were not retired sooner given Applicant\u2019s income level and the relatively modest level of\nthe debts.  The Judge properly evaluated the totality of Applicant\u2019s debt history when addressing the\nissue of whether Applicant had acted responsibly regarding his finances.  Given the facts of this case,\nthe Judge was not required, as a matter of law, to conclude that Applicant had mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s case.  \nApplicant relies on the Board\u2019s rulings in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009)\nto establish error on the part of the Judge in this case.  The Board concludes that the facts in the cited\ncase are significantly different from the instant case, and, therefore, nothing contained therein\nestablishes error on the part of the Judge in this case.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\n\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

In the spring \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 \n\nof 2000, he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and was a \nmember of a national honor society. (Ex. O, Tr. 72) He has been steadily employed \nsince 1997. (Tr. 74)  \n \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant purchased a 2003 Mitsubishi automobile for \napproximately $41,0002 for his sister who was an administrative assistant at an \nengineering company. (Ex. 2, p. I9, Tr. 105) In November 2003, criminal charges were \nbrought against his mother and sister when Applicant\u2019s niece cut her chin and \nemergency treatment was not sought. (Ex. V, Tr. 76) Both were briefly incarcerated. (Tr. \n115) His sister was charged with failing to provide medical attention to a child younger \nthan 15 years of age which recklessly caused bodily injury by omission, a felony. (Ex. V) \nApplicant provided $2,700 for his mother\u2019s attorney fees. (Tr. 77) Applicant gives his \nmother $150 per month for her support. (Tr. 78)  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant purchased a 2004 Ford Ranger pick-up truck for $13,000 and \na Ford Expedition, SUV, for $27,000. (Tr. 83) Applicant\u2019s annual salary was $48,000 \nand the two cars cost $40,000. His wife\u2019s annual salary added another $30,000. (Tr. 58, \n114) In 2004, the payments on his vehicles became delinquent, but the creditor agreed \nto add the delinquent payments to the end of the loan period, which extended the \nrepayment period to July 2009. (Tr. 84) Applicant has recently paid for his vehicles, on \nwhich he had been paying $700 monthly. (Tr. 68)  \n \n \nIn June 2004, the Mitsubishi was repossessed when his sister failed to make the \n$570 monthly payments because she was out of work for six weeks and also had to pay \nfor her attorney. (Tr. 79) The car was sold and a balance of $11,000 remained to be \npaid. (Ex. 6) Applicant told the lender he would be liable for the debt and made two \n$300 payments on the debt. (Tr. 79) When the $300 payments caused his inability to \nmake his other monthly payments, he stopped. (Ex. 2, p. I6). Five years later, a \ncollection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was attempting to collect the debt, which had now grown \nto $20,550. In September 2004, Applicant sought legal advice concerning this debt and \nwas advised to file bankruptcy. He was told by legal counsel not to make additional \npayments on his debts anticipating his bankruptcy filing.  \n \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant received a substantial pay increase and was \ninformed he no longer qualified for bankruptcy protection. (Ex. 2, p. I7) His annual salary \nwas $65,000 at his new job and his wife\u2019s annual pay remained at $30,000 for a \ncombined annual salary of $95,000. (Tr. 58, 74, 119) In January 2005, Applicant \nattempted to set up a repayment plan. (Tr. 82) Between 2005 and 2007, Applicant was \nable to pay his bills in a timely manner, except for the debts listed in the SOR. In \nOctober 2009, Applicant informed the creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.c) he was willing to pay $2,840 \non the $6,235 credit card debt. (Ex. C) In November 2009, the creditor made a counter \noffer to settle the debt for $3,000, which Applicant accepted and paid. (Ex. W) \n \n                                                          \n2 The total cost of the car was $40,966, which included approximately $14,000 in finance charges. (Tr. 2, \np. I9) \n \n3 \n\n \nIn August 2007, Applicant received $24,286 from the sale of his home. (Ex. 2, p. I \n13) He had anticipated using the money to pay his debts. However, he had to make an \n$18,000 down payment on a new home. (Ex. 2, p. I7) Applicant was able to pay off two \ndebts not listed in the SOR, one for $4,200 and the other for $2,000. (Ex. 2, p. l I18 and \nI19) The house was sold for $161,000 and the new home purchased for $189,000. (Tr. \n87) The new home was in a better area and better school district. (Tr. 87) In 2008, \nApplicant purchased furniture for $5,000 for the new house. (Tr. 92) He currently owes \n$1,400 on the account. (Tr. 93)  \n  \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.d and \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. (Answer to SOR) Applicant owed a credit card company $19,237 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). The account was sold from one collection agency to another. Applicant asserts this \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is a duplicate debt. The debt was transferred to the collection agency \nattempting to collect two credit card debts placed for collection: $10,116 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nMasterCard account and $6,606 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) VISA account. (Answer to SOR, Tr. 61) \nWhen Applicant contacted the agency, they wanted Applicant to commit to a payment \nhe could not pay. He asserts they offered to settle for 50 per cent of the debt. In August \n2008, when Applicant completed a Questionnaire of Sensitive Positions, Standard Form \n(SF) 86, in response to question 28b, he indicated he owed $9,721 and $6,341 on these \ntwo debts. (Ex. 1, p 9, Tr. 112)  \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant contacted the creditor by letter and requested \nverification of the debt. (Ex. R) At the hearing, Applicant stated he was going to pay the \ncreditor. (Tr. 126) No evidence of payment has been received. In October 2008, \nApplicant stated he wanted to pay the SOR debts. At the hearing he again stated he \nwanted to pay the SOR debts. (Tr. 100, 126) Following the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nindicated the debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s CBR. There is no indication \nApplicant now intends to satisfy this past due obligation. \n \n \nApplicant owed a credit card company $6,235 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), which the company \noffered to settle for 60 percent of the balance. In October 2009, Applicant sent the \ncreditor a letter offering to pay $1,560 on the debt. (Ex. C) In November 2009, the \ncreditor made a counter offer to settle the debt for $1,870, which Applicant accepted \nand paid. (Ex. X) \n \n \nIn October 2008, when Applicant was first interviewed about his financial \nproblems, he discussed the four SOR debts, which he admitted owing. He stated he \nwanted to repay the debts, but the collection agencies wanted only large lump-sum \npayments, which he could not afford. (Ex. 3) \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant responded to written interrogatories. (Ex. 2) At that time \nhis monthly income was $4,863, his monthly expenses $1,348, his monthly debt \npayment approximately $3,000, and his monthly net remainder was $555. (Ex. 2, p I4) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s net remainder was $800. (Ex. P) His net worth was $33,000. \n(Ex. P)  \n \n \n4 \n\n \nIn September 2009, Applicant contacted and received financial counseling from a \nconsumer credit counseling service. (Ex. B) Applicant is current on his mortgage, \nstudent loan, and ten additional accounts not listed in the SOR. (Ex. S)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2009 credit bureau report (CBR) lists two negative \naccounts. (Ex. A) Those are the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6 1.c, which \nApplicant has paid by mean of a $5,000 loan. (Tr. 62, 100) Recently, Applicant paid off \ntwo accounts and one loan not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 91-92)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n \n5 \n\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems starting in 2004 or 2005. Applicant owed approximately $43,500 on four past \ndue obligations owed to three3 creditors. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n                                                          \n3 Applicant\u2019s September 2008 CBR (Ex. 6, p. 12) clearly indicates the collection agency listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d and e. was collecting for the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. These are the same debts and I find for \nApplicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.b. as a duplication of the other two debts.  \n \n6 \n\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2004 when his sister and mother were \nincarcerated. He provided his mother approximately $3,000 in attorney fees. In addition, \nthe vehicle he had purchased, on which his sister was paying, was repossessed when \nshe was out of work for six weeks and unable to continue the payments. Although \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s joint annual salary was $78,000, he was unable to pay his debts \nas agreed and make the $570 monthly car payment. All his creditors, except for the \nthree creditors listed in the SOR, worked with Applicant to arrange repayment of the \ndebts. Following the hearing, Applicant paid two the SOR creditors. There is no \nevidence he has paid the remaining creditor or established a repayment plan with that \ncreditor.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence because he had two large delinquent debts from \nNovember 2008 until December 2009. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant \ndoes not receive credit under AG \u00b6 20(a). Two of the creditors were not paid until after \nthe hearing and one creditor remains unpaid. The debts are a VISA account, a \nMasterCard account, a credit card account, and vehicle loan, which are common debts. \nThe debts were not incurred under unusual circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(b) partially applies. Applicant experienced an unexpected $3,000 debt \nwhen his mother needed funds to pay her attorney and his sister stopped making the \ncar payments. These are factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control for which he deserves \nsome mitigation. However, these events occurred in 2004. Until 2006, Applicant\u2019s \n \n7 \n\nhousehold annual salary was between $78,000 and $95,000. It has been more than five \nyears since the events. Additionally, it is not unexpected that someone who purchases a \ncar for another will be required to make payment on the vehicle if the other person stops \npaying. AG & 20(b) has limited application.  \n \nAG & 20(c) also has limited application. Applicant has received counseling and \nrecently obtained a loan to pay two of the three SOR creditors. Except for the SOR \ndebts, Applicant paid his other obligations in a timely manner. AG & 20(c) does not fully \napply because Applicant has not addressed the $16,700 VISA and MasterCard debts \nlisted in SOR & 1.d and 1.e.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies to the debts in SOR & 1.a and 1.c because Applicant \nobtained a loan and paid them. As previously stated, the debt in SOR & 1.b is a \nduplication of other debt listed in the SOR. I find Applicant has mitigated these three \ndebts.  \n \nThe remaining $16,700 debt remains unpaid. In October 2008, Applicant stated \nhe wanted to pay the debt, which he restated at the hearing. However, no indication of \npayment or the establishment of a repayment plan has been received. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel asserts this creditor does not appear on Applicant\u2019s recent CBR. There are \nnumerous reasons why a debt may or may not appear on a CBR. In this case, Applicant \nadmitted owing the VISA and MasterCard debts. He listed them on his SF 86, he \ndiscussed them in his October 2008 interview, in his March 2009 interrogatory \nresponse, and at the hearing. He stated he wanted to pay the money. But the debts \nremain unpaid. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were credit card \naccounts placed for collection and the balance owed on a repossessed vehicle. \nApplicant\u2019s household income was between $78,000 and $95,000 and the debts were \n \n8 \n\n \n9 \nnot addressed. I find Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAdditionally, there is no clear indication that the remaining debt is being resolved. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligation, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not \nwarranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d and 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(GE 1) On January 28, 2013, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG) the President promulgated on December 29, 2005. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF was unable to find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for \n 06/19/2013\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nApplicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for \na determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked.  \n \nOn March 19, 2013, the DOD Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response, and Applicant requested a hearing. (HE 3) On April 16, \n2013, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On \nApril 23, 2013, the case was assigned to me. On May 1, 2013, DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice, setting the hearing for May 30, 2013. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as \nscheduled. Department Counsel offered six exhibits, and Applicant offered four exhibits. \n(Tr. 22, 50; GE 1-6; AE A-D) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE \nA-D. (Tr. 22-23, 51-53) Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR. (HE 1-3) On June 10, 2013, I received the transcript of the \nhearing.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted with explanations the underlying factual \npredicate for all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He denied that he intended or attempted \nto conceal anything from the Government. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and \nmitigating information. (HE 3) He denied that the allegations raised or established \nsecurity concerns. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old welder employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 7; GE 1) \nHis income is $60,000 to $80,000 per year. (Tr. 111) In 2001, he graduated from high \nschool, and he has about three semesters of college. His courses focused on \nengineering. (Tr. 7-9) He served in the Marine Corps from 2001 to 2004 for a total of 39 \nmonths. (Tr. 9) He served one full tour and one partial tour in Iraq.  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey an order \nconcerning wearing earrings while on leave; and for being late for work after he returned \nfrom leave. (Tr. 79-83; SOR \u00b6 1.f)  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s specialty in the Marine Corps was metal working or welding. In March \n2004, Applicant was on his second tour in Iraq. (Tr. 98) He was working 17 to 18 hours \na day. (Tr. 99) He was exhausted from excessive work and attempting to meet his \nresponsibilities. (Tr. 98) Someone told a lie to the first sergeant about him, and he was \nplaced on extra duty. (Tr. 99) He was also going through a divorce. (Tr. 100) He went to \na psychiatrist in Iraq because he was cracking or decompensating under the strain. (Tr. \n100) He was medically evacuated from Iraq back to his home base in the United States. \n(Tr. 100-102) He received some anger management and alcohol abuse counseling. (GE \n3 at 4) Shortly thereafter, Applicant was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps \nfor personality disorder or unsuitability. (Tr. 9, 102-106)1 He believed he was diagnosed \nwith post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (GE 3 at 4) He did not apply for a disability \n                                            \n1 Applicant thought a meeting with the chain of command to discuss his discharge was actually a \ncourt-martial. (Tr. 102-106) His evident lack of understanding of legal matters contributed to his failure to \nprovide complete and accurate information on his May 21, 2008 SF 86.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nrating from the Department of Veterans Affairs because he did not want a \u201ccrutch.\u201d (Tr. \n106) He did not receive any post-service mental health counseling or psychiatric or \nanxiety medication. (Tr. 106-107)   \n \nIn 2007, Applicant and his first spouse were arguing. (Tr. 72) His spouse started \nswinging at Applicant, and he grabbed and held her. (Tr. 72) Later, Applicant and his \nspouse reconciled. (Tr. 72-75) Several months later, Applicant became upset that she \nwas running around on him, and he took their son and left. (Tr. 75) She made a claim of \ndomestic violence based on the incident several months previously where he grabbed \nher, and she obtained a restraining order. (Tr. 74-75; SOR \u00b6 1.d) The police took \nApplicant\u2019s son away from Applicant and gave his son to his spouse. (Tr. 74-75) His \nspouse was a stripper. Applicant asked her to leave that employment, and she refused. \n(Tr. 75-76) Gradually, Applicant received greater custody rights from the court until he \nreceived sole custody of his son. (Tr. 76-77) His relationship with his former spouse is \ncurrently amicable, and he allows her to visit her son. (Tr. 78)     \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct for public urination. (Tr. \n79) The charge was dismissed. (Tr. 79) \n  \nApplicant and his spouse have been living together for four years and married for \ntwo years. (Tr. 56) His current spouse has two children from a prior marriage. (Tr. 56) \nApplicant has one child from a prior marriage, and one child with his current spouse. \n(Tr. 56) All four children live with Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 57) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c allege that Applicant was charged in November 2008 and \nDecember 2008 with trespassing on private property and in August 2010, he was \ncharged with electronic mail harassment. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s former husband was \nattempting to re-establish his relationship with Applicant\u2019s spouse. (Tr. 58) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse\u2019s former husband\u2019s mother (M) harassed Applicant and his spouse because \nApplicant\u2019s spouse would not leave Applicant. (Tr. 58-59) Applicant filed charges of \nharassment against M, and M retaliated with false charges and allegations against \nApplicant. (Tr. 54-71) He went to court a dozen times to address M\u2019s allegations. (Tr. \n60) Ultimately, all charges were dismissed. (Tr. 61-62)  \n \nApplicant and his spouse received sole custody of their four children. (Tr. 62-63) \nCurrently, there are contempt of court papers filed by Applicant and his spouse pending \nagainst M because she kept her grandchildren and would not bring them back to \nApplicant and his spouse on time. (Tr. 63-64) Applicant does not communicate with his \nspouse\u2019s former husband and M except in family court. (Tr. 67) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges that Applicant failed to tell his facility security officer (FSO) \nabout court orders in November 2008 and December 2008 alleging Applicant \ntrespassed on private property, and in August 2010, he was charged with electronic \nmail harassment. (Tr. 32; GE 5) Applicant\u2019s FSO said Applicant told his FSO about \ngoing to court for disputes involving his spouse. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant did not necessarily \nprovide documentation from the court or the specifics of particular court hearings. (Tr. \n32-33) Applicant\u2019s FSO did not ask for documentation, and after Applicant came back \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nfrom court, Applicant would describe the status of this case. (Tr. 34) His FSO did not \nbelieve that Applicant ever withheld requested information or was deceptive about his \nsituation with his former spouse. (Tr. 34-35) Applicant was in court six weeks before his \nhearing on custody issues, and Applicant expects to be back in court in another month. \n(Tr. 108) Applicant represents himself in family court. (Tr. 109) \n \nOn his May 21, 2008 SF 86, Applicant disclosed the following information of \npossible security concern: (1) he received mental health treatment from a Navy \nspecialist from 2001 to 2004; (2) he left employment three times under allegations of \nunsatisfactory performance or under unfavorable conditions; (3) he received nonjudicial \npunishment in 2003; (4) he used marijuana weekly from September 2004 to June 2006; \n(5) he had delinquent debts; and (6) he was immersed in child custody litigation with his \nformer spouse. (GE 1) \n \nWhen Applicant completed his May 21, 2008 SF 86, he denied that he had been \ncharged with any offense in the last seven years. (Tr. 87; GE 1; SOR \u00b6 1.g) For the May \n2007 disorderly conduct, Applicant believed he did not have to disclose it because it \nwas nolle prossed\u2014dismissal of the charges to him meant there were no charges. (Tr. \n89-90) Applicant conceded he was wrong for not reporting the disorderly conduct \ncharge on his SF 86. (Tr. 90) In regard to the September 2007 civil domestic violence \norder, Applicant was never charged. (Tr. 88)  \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the illegal drug use question on his May 21, 2008 \nSF 86, he disclosed his extensive marijuana use, but failed to disclose his three-time \nuse of ecstasy. (Tr. 90; GE 1; SOR \u00b6 1.h) He volunteered to an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator the he used ecstasy on three occasions from October \n2005 to January 2006 in his July 29, 2008 OPM personal subject interview (PSI). (GE 3 \nat 6-7) During the same OPM PSI, he admitted that he associated with drug users; \nhowever, at his hearing, he said he no longer does so. (Tr. 87; SOR \u00b6 1.j)  \n \nIn his July 29, 2008 OPM PSI, Applicant described very heavy involvement with \nmarijuana for several years, including distribution of marijuana. (GE 3 at 5-6) His OPM \nPSI thoroughly describes multiple areas of security concern. (GE 3)   \n \nWhen Applicant completed his May 21, 2008 SF 86, he disclosed he was \ninvolved in a child custody lawsuit; however, he did not disclose the September 2007 \ncivil domestic violence order. (Tr. 91; GE 1; SOR \u00b6 1.i) Applicant was unsure of his \nrationale for not disclosing the domestic violence order at the time he completed his SF \n86; however, he thought he did not disclose it because it was dismissed. (Tr. 92) He \nmay also have failed to disclose the order because he believed it was without merit. (Tr. \n92) \n \nApplicant said he respected the Government\u2019s right to ask for personal \ninformation as part of a security investigation. (Tr. 93-94) He promised to carefully and \nfully answer all questions. (Tr. 93-94)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nAfter 2007, Applicant changed. (Tr. 85) He accepted responsibility for his family, \nand he improved his work habits. (Tr. 85, 96) He stopped using marijuana. His ongoing \nstruggle with M and his former spouse regarding custody issues have been a huge \ndrain on Applicant\u2019s morale and wellbeing. (Tr. 85-86) He loves his work and is \noptimistic about his future. (Tr. 96-97) He wants to support his family and his employer. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s FSO retired from the Army after 30 years of service as a sergeant \nmajor. (Tr. 39, 42-47) His FSO has had daily contact with Applicant for three years. (Tr. \n24-25, 39-41) Applicant performs a variety of tasks as a fabricator and welder with \nlayouts, computers, and blueprints. (Tr. 25, 28, 30) Applicant has a commercial driver\u2019s \nlicense. (Tr. 110) He has an excellent reputation with customers; he is a fine union \nsteward; and he works well with colleagues. (Tr. 28, 30-31) Applicant\u2019s \u201cwork ethic is \noutstanding.\u201d (Tr. 25) He has improved his abilities through training; he shows initiative; \nand he is reliable, diligent, trustworthy, honest, and responsible. (Tr. 26-27, 37-38) \nApplicant would have been promoted to foreman, if he had a security clearance. (Tr. 29) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend of eight years describes Applicant as honest and generous. \n(AE A) Applicant is more mature and responsible now. (AE A) He recommends \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE A) Two neighbors, who have known \nApplicant for thirty years, depict Applicant as a respectful, diligent, and loyal family man. \n(AE B-C) He received an April 28, 2013 letter of appreciation for his contributions to his \nemployer supporting troops with better more survivable equipment. (AE D)   \n \n \nDuring his Marine Corps service, Applicant was awarded the Combat Action \nRibbon, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon, National Defense Service Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Letter of \nAppreciation, and Good Conduct Medal. (GE 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Adverse clearance decisions are made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.\u201d See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision \non any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nFive personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are potentially \napplicable. Those five disqualifying conditions provide:   \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations,   \n. . . [to] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to [a] . . . security official, or other official government \nrepresentative;2 \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: .  .  . (3) a pattern of . . . or rule \nviolations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \n                                            \n2The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  .  .  .   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. The Government produced sufficient evidence to \nmeet the substantial evidence threshold that Applicant failed to provide required \ninformation on his May 21, 2008 SF 86. He failed to disclose: the restraining orders and \ncharges arising from his custody litigation; his ecstasy use on three occasions; and his \narrest or charge for disorderly conduct. His FSO provided a letter stating that Applicant \nfailed to fully disclose information about his custody litigation.  \n \nThe Government presented substantial evidence of court orders and charges \narising from his custody litigation, his nonjudicial punishment in January 2003, and his \nassociation with drug users, and he failed to keep his FSO fully informed of the status of \nhis family court litigation. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply because there \nis sufficient credible adverse information under the other cited disqualifying conditions \nfor an adverse determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies. There is substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in \nconduct which adversely affects his personal, professional, and community standing. \nFurther analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required.    \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;   \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies to the restraining orders and charges arising from Applicant\u2019s \nchild custody litigation. The family court has been working with Applicant, his family, and \nhis former spouse and her family for five years. The family court resolved the charges \nand counter charges and awarded Applicant and his spouse full custody of the two \nchildren from Applicant\u2019s former spouse\u2019s marriage.  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies to the allegations that Applicant did not provide full and \ncomplete information on his May 21, 2008 SF 86. Applicant disclosed that he: (1) \nreceived mental health treatment from a Navy specialist from 2001 to 2004; (2) left \nemployment three times under allegations of unsatisfactory performance or under \nunfavorable conditions; (3) received nonjudicial punishment in 2003; (4) used marijuana \nweekly from September 2004 to June 2006; (5) had delinquent debts; and (6) was \nimmersed in child custody litigation with his former spouse. His disclosure of the \ncustody litigation was sufficient to place the Government on notice of this area for \nfurther inquiry and investigation. He is unsophisticated about legal matters, and he did \nnot understand the necessity or requirements for disclosure of his disorderly conduct \nbecause the charge was dismissed and specific information about the custody related \nlitigation. Compared to hundreds of uses of marijuana, his three-time ecstasy use was \napparently overlooked.     \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his ecstasy use on his SF 86. \nDuring his July 29, 2008 OPM PSI, he described his extensive marijuana involvement \nand later during the interview mentioned his three-time ecstasy use. The only evidence \nof Applicant\u2019s ecstasy use was Applicant\u2019s admission during his OPM PSI.  \n \nAG 17(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to fully disclose information to his FSO and \nhis association with drug users that he described in his OPM PSI. Applicant\u2019s FSO \nexplained that Applicant told him when he was going to court for custody issues and he \nwas aware of the charges and counter charges. Applicant provided documentation upon \nrequest about the litigation. Applicant ended his association with drug users. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) mitigates the security concern raised under AG \u00b6 16(e). I do not \nbelieve Applicant could be coerced or pressured into release of classified information by \nthreats of public disclosure of his history of involvement with the family court, allegations \nof falsification of his SF 86, history of illegal drug use, or disorderly conduct charge.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies. Applicant acknowledged all of his misbehavior in his OPM \nPSI and at his hearing. The most recent conduct in the SOR, aside from the complaints \nand counter complaints arising from the child custody litigation, is in 2008, more than \nfour years ago. Applicant has changed and matured. He is a responsible employee and \nfamily man. He has taken \u201cpositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant provided sufficient information to refute most of the SOR allegations. \nHe did not intentionally attempt to deceive the Government about matters of security \nconcern. He credibly promised to be very careful and thorough when completing future \nSF 86. The allegations of M are not substantiated. The family court did not credit her \nallegations, and Applicant and his spouse have sole custody of Applicant spouse\u2019s \nchildren from her previous marriage. His 2007 charge of disorderly conduct was \ndismissed and is stale. Applicant sees his FSO every workday, and he has a good \nrelationship with his FSO. He will keep his FSO informed of matters of possible security \nconcern. Applicant ended his marijuana involvement several years ago, and he no \nlonger associates with drug users. \n \nApplicant served honorably in the Marine Corps, including combat service in Iraq. \nAfter leaving the Marine Corps, he abused marijuana and was irresponsible for a time. \nHe married his current spouse and is now a responsible family man, who is dedicated to \nthe welfare of his children. He is a diligent and trustworthy employee, who contributes to \nhis employer and the national defense. He has alleviated all personal conduct concerns.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude personal conduct concerns \nare mitigated, and he is eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn July 5, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF\n86) to renew a security clearance required for his job with a defense contractor. After\nthe ensuing background investigation was completed, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to\n1\nclarify or augment information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified\nOctober 28, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n3\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n2\ninformation. On February 4, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the adjudicative\nguidelines (AG)  for personal conduct (Guideline E), financial considerations (Guideline\n3\nF), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on June 21, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on June 24,\n2010, I convened a hearing in this matter on July 15, 2010. The parties appeared as\nscheduled. The Government presented 11 exhibits (Gx. 1 - 11), which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant testified and proffered six exhibits, which were admitted\nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - F. Additionally, I left the record open\nafter the hearing to give Applicant time to submit additional relevant information. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on July 29, 2010. The record closed the same\nday when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which I admitted without\nobjection as Ax. G.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged that in September 2000, Applicant\nwas charged and convicted of uttering a fraudulent check (SOR 1.a); that in January\n2004, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for failure to show proof of auto insurance\n(SOR 1.b); that in March 2004, the January 2004 suspension of his driver\u2019s license was\nextended because he was driving on that suspended license (SOR 1.c); that in April\n2004, he was charged and convicted of the felony offense of breach of trust with\nfraudulent intent over $1,000 but less than $5,000, for which he was sentenced to five\nyears (suspended) in jail, placed on three years probation, and ordered to pay\nrestitution (SOR 1.d); that in April 2006, his probation was extended for two years for\nfailing to pay restitution, fines, and costs as ordered by the court when he was convicted\nas alleged in SOR 1.d (SOR 1.e); that in August 2006 he was charged with driving on a\nsuspended license (SOR 1.f); and that in November 2007, his probation from April 2004\nwas again extended for failure to pay restitution, fines, and costs as ordered by the\ncourt in April 2006 (SOR 1.g). In response, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and\n1.e, and he denied SOR 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g.\nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately made a\nfalse statement to a Government investigator during his October 13, 2008, subject\ninterview. Specifically, the Government alleged that the Applicant attempted to minimize\nthe criminality of his conduct that led to his arrest in April 2004 as alleged in SOR 1.d\n(SOR 2.a). In response, Applicant admitted this allegation.\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant accrued\napproximately $22,724 of delinquent debt for 16 accounts (SOR 3.a - 3.p). The\nGovernment also cross-alleged as disqualifying financial information the allegations in\n\n3\nSOR 1.a, 1.e, and 1.g (SOR 3.q) In response, Applicant denied SOR 3.a - 3.o, but\nadmitted SOR 3.p. His answers to SOR 1.a, 1.e, and 1.g serve by reference as his\nanswer to SOR 3.q. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions, and having reviewed\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 32 years old and has been employed since June 2008 by a defense\ncontractor in a position that requires a security clearance. He also is in the U.S. Army\nNational Guard, where he holds the rank of staff sergeant (paygrade E-6). In 2003, he\nwas recalled to active duty and deployed to Iraq for 12 months. He again deployed to\nIraq from May 2009 until May 2010. Applicant also served in the U.S. Navy from June\n1996 until June 1999, then affiliated in a reserve status with the Army National Guard in\nFebruary 2000. Applicant first obtained a security clearance while in the Navy, and he\nstill holds a clearance through his Army National Guard affiliation. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant and his wife have been married since March 2008, and they have three\nchildren (ages 13, 8, and 3). Applicant also has a 13-year-old child by another woman to\nwhom he pays $250 each month in child support. (Gx. 1; Tr. 82 - 83)\nAfter he left the Navy in 1999, Applicant began to have financial problems\nbecause he was either unemployed or under-employed. In August 2001, he was hired\nby a franchise of a nationally-known auto parts chain. He eventually became the store\nmanager. However, in 2004 he converted approximately $1,463.26 of store refunds into\ncash, which he then used for his own purposes. In April 2004, Applicant pleaded guilty\nto a felony charge of breach of trust with fraudulent intent over $1,000 but less than\n$5,000. Applicant was sentenced to five years in jail, which was suspended. He was\nplaced on three years probation, and ordered to perform 100 hours of community\nservice. He was also ordered to pay back the money he stole plus fines and court costs.\n(Gx.1; Gx. 3; Gx. 4) Applicant testified that he did this because, as a store manager, he\nworked nearly 70 hours each week yet was paid only $9 hourly. He felt underpaid and\ndecided to take what he felt was due him. Applicant acknowledged this did not justify\nwhat he did. (Tr. 69 - 70)\nApplicant was twice charged with violating the terms of his probation. Specifically,\nhe was delinquent in making the required restitution payments ordered by the court.\nApplicant was not convicted of the actual charges; rather, the terms by which he was to\npay were revised by the court and he was put on a new payment plan. He otherwise\ncomplied with the terms of his probation, from which he was released in March 2008,\none year later than originally intended. (Ax. F)\nApplicant disclosed his felony conviction on his September 2008 SF 86.\nHowever, in October 2008, when he was interviewed by a Government investigator,\nApplicant stated that he was charged with theft because an engine was missing from\nthe store\u2019s inventory. Applicant went on to explain that, because he was the store\nmanager he was told he would have to pay for it. He told the Government agent that,\nrather than pay for the engine, he quit his job. Applicant characterized the resolution of\nthis event as a civil action (See Gx. 2: \u201cThe case was found in favor of the company and\n[Applicant] had to pay for the missing property.\u201d) in which the company prevailed. He\n\n4\nalso stated that he paid for the missing property and that \u201cno further action was taken.\u201d\n(Id.) According to police and court records, Applicant was charged through a grand jury\nindictment with the felony specified in SOR 1.d. He pleaded guilty and received the\nsentence specified in SOR 1.d. Applicant has admitted that he intentionally falsified his\nstatements about this allegation during his subject interview, but did not otherwise\naddress his conduct in response to the SOR or at his hearing.\nThe financial problems Applicant experienced after he left the Navy were\nexacerbated by the loss of his job at the auto parts store. According to available credit\nreports, he amassed approximately $22,724 of delinquent debt for 16 unpaid accounts.\nOf those debts, one is for $16,199 and represents a car loan he obtained while he was\nin the Navy, and on which Applicant defaulted in February 2002. (Gx. 9; Gx. 10; Gx. 11)\nThe car was repossessed and Applicant believes it was resold, with the proceeds to be\napplied to the loan obligation. However, Applicant has not verified that his actual debt is\nless than that listed in the credit reports. Nor has he contacted that creditor to try and\nresolve the debt. (Tr. 54 - 55) Of the remaining 10 debts totaling $6,525, Applicant\nestablished that he has resolved six of them (SOR 3.a - 3.d, 3.g, and 3.i) totaling\napproximately $2,382. (Ax. G)\nApplicant also established that he and his wife bought a house in March 2010\nafter they resolved other (unalleged) debts to raise their credit score and qualify for a\nVeterans\u2019 Administration mortgage subsidy program. That effort began in late 2009.\nApplicant and his wife were able to make progress on resolving their debts because\nApplicant\u2019s military pay when he was deployed was significantly higher than the pay\nfrom his defense contractor job. (Ax. C; Tr. 45) Applicant also testified that he has taken\nadvantage of financial counseling programs offered through the Army, and that his\ncommand made financial responsibility a training priority. (Tr. 59, 66, 77 - 78) Applicant\nfurther testified, but did not document, that he has about $8,000 in savings, he has a\npositive monthly cash flow of about $2,500, and the balance on a retirement account he\nstarted while he was in the Navy is now about $125,000. (Tr. 63 - 65)\nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s 2004 felony conviction and his subsequent probation\nviolations, in September 2000, Applicant was also charged with uttering a fraudulent\ncheck in September 2000. He was found guilty through a bench trial in May 2001, and\nhe was fined and ordered to make restitution. In January 2004, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended after he was charged with not having car insurance. He was\nalso charged in March 2004 with driving on that suspended driver\u2019s license. However,\nApplicant explained that his license was suspended without his knowledge while he was\ndeployed to Iraq in 2003. (Tr. 43) Available information showed that this charge actually\nstemmed from the aforementioned license suspension in January 2004, because\nApplicant had not yet resolved the question of his insurance so he could get his license\nback. (Gx. 6 and 7) In August 2006, Applicant was again charged with driving on a\nsuspended license. Applicant denied the SOR allegation (SOR 1.f) regarding this\ncharge, and aside from a listing of an arrest in Gx. 3 there is no other information\navailable about what happened.\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n5\nApplicant\u2019s performance in the Army during his active duty recalls was excellent.\nHe received numerous awards and other forms of recognition for his work. (Ax. B) His\npersonal references describe Applicant as reliable and of good character. (Ax. A)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct), AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline\nF - Financial Considerations), and AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n6\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\n See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n6\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR 3.a - 3.q; that is, that Applicant accrued about $22,724 of delinquent debt for 16\nunpaid accounts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from uneven employment after\nhe left the Navy in 1999, but were exacerbated by the loss of his job in 2004 when he\nwas arrested for stealing from his employer. Applicant presented information showing\nhe has paid some of his debts, but he still owes more than $20,000 in delinquencies.\nFurther, he twice violated the terms of his probation after his 2004 arrest by failing to\npay restitution as ordered by the sentencing court, and he was convicted in 2001 of\nissuing a worthless check. All of the foregoing requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b6 19(d) (deceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax\nevasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional\nfinancial breaches of trust).\nGiven the facts of this case, I have considered possible application of the\nmitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). However, I conclude the record\ndoes not support application of any of these factors.\n\n7\nIn response to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant established that he has paid or\notherwise resolved six of the debts listed in the SOR. Applicant also established that he\nstarted paying his debts in late 2009, in an effort to clean up his credit so he and his\nwife could buy a house. Applicant established through Ax. C that he and his wife bought\na house in March 2010. But while Applicant asserted that he completed financial\ncounseling through the Army, that he has significant positive cash flow each month, and\nthat he has savings in excess of $130,000, he has not corroborated his current finances\nthrough any documentation. Given his previous misrepresentations about relevant\ninformation in his background, the Government is entitled to such proof before\nconcluding that his current finances are sound. On balance, Applicant still carries\nsignificant delinquent debt, but he has not presented sufficient information to show how,\nif at all, his debt was due to unusual or unforeseen circumstances, or why he did not act\nsooner to resolve his debts despite being steadily employed since 2008. On balance, he\nhas not met his burden of persuasion in response to the adverse information that\nsupports the Government\u2019s decision to refuse his application for a security clearance.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government presented sufficient reliable information to support its\nallegations that Applicant has engaged in criminal conduct on several occasions in the\npast 10 years. His crimes range from minor bad check charges to a felony conviction for\ntheft from his employer. He also twice violated the terms of his probation after his felony\nconviction. The security concern raised by the facts established by the Government\u2019s\ninformation is stated at AG \u00b6 30 as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of the disqualifying conditions\nat AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted) and AG \u00b631(e) (violation of parole or\nprobation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program). \nIn response, Applicant has argued that he is now more mature and responsible.\nThus, he avers that his criminal conduct is remote in time and circumstance, and not\nlikely to recur. Given the facts and circumstances of this case, I have considered the\npossible application of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement).\nApplicant\u2019s position is that he accepts responsibility for his past actions and that\nhe is not likely to engage in illegal conduct. His last known criminal conduct occurred in\n\n8\n2007, when he violated the terms of his probation. Thus, court oversight of his conduct\ndid not end until March 2008. Seven months later, when he was interviewed for his\nsecurity clearance, he lied to a Government investigator about his felony arrest,\nessentially denying that he did anything wrong. At hearing, he did not address this\nconduct other than to admit that his falsification was intentional. His lack of candor\nundermines any claim that he is rehabilitated and has accepted responsibility for his\nactions. Applicant was 26 years old and a veteran of the military when he stole from his\nemployer. He was 30 years old when he lied during his subject interview. These facts\nweaken his claim that age and maturity will preclude future criminal conduct. The\nforegoing persuades me that Applicant has not met his burden in response to the\nGovernment\u2019s information and that he has not mitigated the security concerns about his\ncriminal conduct. \nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support its allegation that\nApplicant deliberately made false statements about his 2004 felony arrest during his\nsubject interview with a Government investigator. Additionally, Applicant admitted the\nallegation in response to the SOR and did not provide any explanation for his conduct in\nthis regard. The security concern raised by this conduct is stated at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires Application of the disqualifying condition\nat AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative). By contrast, Applicant presented no information to\nexplain, refute, or mitigate his deliberate falsification to a Government investigator.\nAccordingly, none of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17 apply, and this guideline is\nresolved against the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 32\nyears old and presumed to be a mature adult. He served in the U.S. Navy until 1999,\nand he has served, by all accounts, with distinction in the U.S. Army National Guard.\nHis service included two deployments to Iraq and he was personally commended for his\nperformance on several occasions. Although Applicant\u2019s finances continue to be of\nconcern relative to his suitability for a security clearance, he appears to be trying to\nimprove his financial standing and his personal circumstances. Unfortunately, he has\nnot documented those efforts sufficiently to outweigh the negative inferences raised by\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra.\n9\n9\nhis recent criminal conduct and his deliberate misrepresentations about that conduct.\nHe has not yet established a documented track record of personal and financial\nreliability that is consistent with the level of trust which the Government must be able to\nplace in him for continued access to classified information. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past and current\n8\ncircumstances shows that doubts remain about his ability or willingness to protect the\nGovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is the\nmost important consideration in these determinations, any doubts about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability to hold a security clearance must be resolved in favor of the Government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.d, \n3.g, 3.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.e - 3.f, \n3.h, 3.j - 3.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

Eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his application for a public trust position (SF 85P) on \nNovember 15, 2007 (Government Exhibit (GX) 4). On August 28, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, citing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guidelines F and J. The action was taken under Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005.  \n \nMarch 23, 2010\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 10, 2009 (GX 2); answered it on \nSeptember 27, 2009; and requested determination on the record without a hearing (GX \n3). DOHA received his response on October 6, 2009. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s written case on November 24, 2009. On December 1, 2009, a \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on December 28, \n2009, and he submitted an undated response that was received by DOHA on February \n11, 2010, which was included in the record without objection from Department Counsel. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 7, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegation in SOR \n\u00b6 1.f, but he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. He admitted the Guideline J \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old certified pharmacy technician employed by a defense \ncontractor. He is a high school graduate who attended college for three years but did \nnot obtain a degree. He has never married. He has worked for his current employer \nsince February 2007. He has worked for various employers as a certified pharmacy \ntechnician since December 2002. He has not previously applied for a public trust \nposition.   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant used credit cards for living expenses while in college (GX 6 at 3-5), and \nhe accumulated six delinquent credit card accounts totaling about $28,516. All the debts \nexcept the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) \ndated December 28, 2007 (GX 7), July 15, 2009 (GX 8), and November 24, 2009 (GX \n9). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is reflected in GX 8 and GX 9. Although Applicant \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, he admitted lesser amounts that did not \ninclude interest and penalties on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e (GX \n3; Response to FORM at 4). He indicated in response to DOHA interrogatories that he \nwas negotiating with his creditors to settle the accounts for the amount due minus \npenalties and interest (GX 5 at 1-4).  \n \n \nApplicant told a security investigator he was unemployed for two months after he \ndropped out of college (GX 6 at 3). However, he reported no periods of unemployment \non his SF 85P (GX 4 at 3). \n \n \nIn December 2009, Applicant accepted an offer of settlement from the creditor \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and he made a monthly payment in January 2010 (Response to \nFORM at 8-9). He received a settlement offer from the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but \nthere is no evidence of any payments on this debt (Response to FORM at 4, 10). \n\n \n3\nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but there is no evidence he has \ncontacted the creditor or disputed the entry with the credit reporting agencies. There is \nalso no evidence that he has filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies \nchallenging the amounts of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e). His credit \nreports reflect only one disputed account, and it is not with any of the creditors alleged \nin the SOR (GX 7 at 6; GX 8 at 2; GX 9 at 2). \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in March 2009. He reported net monthly income of $1,621, expenses of \n$953, debt payments of $375, and a net remainder of $293. His monthly debt payments \nwere for a credit card account, student loans, and installment payments to the court in \nconnection with his DUI conviction. He also reported $2,334 in bank savings and $300 \nin stocks and bonds (GX 5 at 6). \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with shoplifting in November 2005. He \ncompleted a diversion program in May 2006 and the charges were dismissed (GX 6 at \n12). The government exhibits do not reflect the underlying facts of the incident. \nAccording to Applicant, he was with a friend who stole a jacket. In his answer to the \nSOR, he stated he accepted an opportunity to enter a diversion program \u201cto get the \nissue over,\u201d even though he was unaware of his friend\u2019s theft (GX 3 at 2). \n \n \nApplicant began consuming beer in 2002, during his senior year of high school, \nbut not to the point of intoxication. During his first year of college, he consumed beer \nand hard liquor to the point of intoxication every weekend. During his next two years of \ncollege, he consumed about four beers twice a month at social events. Starting in \nNovember 2006, he increased his consumption to six beers every Friday and Saturday \n(GX 6 at 7-8). In November 2007, he was arrested for driving under the influence. Under \na plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to \u201cextreme DUI\u201d and having a blood-alcohol level \nof .15% or more. In February 2008, he was sentenced to ten days in jail, ordered to pay \nfines and costs totaling $3,566, and placed on probation for five years (GX 6 at 14). He \nwas ordered to complete ten weeks of alcohol and drug classes and to install an \ninterlock device on his vehicle for one year, and he received a restricted driver\u2019s license \nthat authorized him to drive only to and from work (GX 6 at 6).  \n \nAs of the date of an interview with a security investigator in October 2008, \nApplicant had not completed the alcohol and drug classes because he was waiting to be \ncontacted. He had not installed an interlock device because his car was impounded, he \ncould not afford the fees to retrieve it, he had not obtained another car, and he was \nriding to and from work on the bus (GX 6 at 7). In December 2008, a warrant was \nissued for his failure to comply with the terms of his probation (GX 6 at 14). The warrant \nwas quashed in February 2009 (GX 6 at 13). \n \n \nApplicant completed the alcohol and drug classes in June 2009 (Response to \nFORM at 7). As of March 1, 2009, he was paying $150 per month on his fines and costs \n\n \n4\nfor the DUI (GX 5 at 5). As of May 15, 2009, he had paid a total of $2,190, leaving a \nbalance due of $1,441 (GX 6 at 15-16). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction an evaluation of the whole \nperson. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security. The government \nmust present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or him or her \neligibility for assignment to a sensitive position.  \n \n\n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $28,516. The trustworthiness \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history is sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \n& 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG & 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, not yet fully resolved, and did not \noccur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns also may be mitigated if Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ AG & \n20(b). Applicant claimed to have had a short period of unemployment, a circumstance \nbeyond his control, but he did not list it on his SF 85P. Even if he was unemployed, he \nhas not acted responsibly, because he took no significant action to resolve his \ndelinquent debts until he learned that they might adversely affect his eligibility for a \npublic trust position. He made his first payment on a delinquent debt in January 2010, \neven though he has been employed at his current job for three years. He has admitted \nthe $748 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but he has not paid it even though he has adequate \nsavings and a steady income. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling and his financial problems are not under control. \n \n\n \n6\n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c-1.f, because Applicant has not acted in good faith, for the reasons \nset out above in my discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b), and he has taken no significant actions to \nresolve the debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant has expressed his disagreement with the interest and penalties assessed on \nhis delinquent credit card accounts, but he has not documented the basis of his \ndisagreement, nor has he presented documentary evidence that he notified any of the \ncredit reporting agencies or any of the creditors alleged in the SOR that he disputes the \nexistence of the debts or the amounts claimed to be due. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \nestablished. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \n\u201cCriminal conduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s shoplifting charge in \nNovember 2005 and his conviction of DUI in February 2008 raise these two \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nApplicant is still on probation for his DUI conviction. Thus, AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual \nis currently on parole or probation) also is raised.  \n \n\n \n7\n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \nthis mitigating condition (\u201cso much time has elapsed\u201d) focuses on whether the criminal \nconduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is \nArecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s shoplifting arrest was more than four years ago, which is \u201ca significant \nperiod of time.\u201d On the other hand, his track record since the shoplifting arrest is one of \nexcessive alcohol consumption, financial irresponsibility, and a serious DUI conviction, \nfor which he is still on probation. I conclude the first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \nestablished. The arrest did not occur under unusual circumstances. Combined with \nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior, it casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b632(a) is not established. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns may be mitigated by \u201cevidence that the person did not \ncommit the offense.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c). The record is sparse regarding the circumstances of \nApplicant\u2019s shoplifting arrest in November 2005. His own explanation tends to negate \nguilt, but his decision not to contest the charges undermines his protestation of \ninnocence. I am satisfied that there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of his culpability. Thus, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. However, because of the sparse record, I have \ngiven this incident little weight in my evaluation of his trustworthiness.  \n \nFinally, trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). In his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant recited his accomplishments in his current job, but he \npresented no evidence from his supervisors, no copies of performance appraisals, and \nno copies of the numerous awards he says he has received. For these reasons, as well \nas the reasons set out above in my discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for an \nassignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline(s), but some \nwarrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant did not request a hearing, limiting my ability to assess his sincerity, \ncredibility, candor, and remorse. He has considerable technical expertise and \nexperience as a certified pharmacy technician, but he does not have a track record of \nresponsible behavior. He consumed alcohol to excess and accumulated heavy credit \ncard debt in college. He dropped out of college, increased his alcohol consumption, and \nwas arrested for shoplifting. He continued to drink heavily and was convicted of a \nserious DUI offense. He did not significantly address his delinquent debts until he \nrealized his job depended on a favorable trustworthiness determination.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for assignment to a \npublic trust position.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Consistent with the\nfollowing discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a systems administrator\nfor a Defense contractor.  He served in the Army from 1998 to 2001.  Following his discharge, he\nexperienced difficulties finding work.  While unemployed, he lived with his parents.  He opened\ndifferent checking accounts using false identification for each.  He wrote checks on these accounts\nand cashed them to defray living expenses.  He was eventually arrested and charged with forgery.\nApplicant completed the probation which resulted from his forgery conviction in 2007.1  Due to his\nunemployment, Applicant acquired a substantial amount of delinquent debt.  Although he\ndemonstrated that he paid off many of the debts alleged in the SOR, he did not corroborate his\nclaims of payment for others, some large, for example, a $7,326 debt apparently related to medical\ntreatment and a $3,135 collection account. \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain errors.  For example, he states\nthat he was not actually convicted of forgery.  Rather, the case was dismissed after he completed the\nconditions of his deferred adjudication.  We note the interview summarized in Item 7 (see Note 1).\nApplicant stated that he pled guilty to forgery and was thereupon found guilty.  He also stated that\nthe charges were later dismissed and, therefore, he did not have a conviction.  This is consistent with\nItem 8, FBI Identification Record.  However, even if the Judge\u2019s characterization of this case is\nerroneous, in that Applicant does not currently have a conviction on his record, it is harmless error.\nThe Judge relied on the underlying circumstances of the case rather than its ultimate legal\ndisposition.  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s statement in the Analysis portion of the decision\nthat he had written the fictitious checks over a two-year period.  He states that the misconduct\noccurred over a matter of months, not years, citing to Item 7 in support.  Applicant is correct, in that\nItem 7 indicates that the forgery scheme took place \u201cfrom late 2001 to early 2002.\u201d  Despite that,\nthere is no reason to believe that, even if he had made a finding consistent with this document, the\nJudge would have decided the case differently.  Therefore, this error is harmless.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that he had not paid off all of his\ndelinquent debts.  He states that the fact that these debts no longer appear on his credit report\ncorroborates his claim of payment.  However, the Judge acknowledged that these debts were no\nlonger reported, but he stated that they were not otherwise explained.  He stated that Applicant did\nnot provide evidence that he had inquired about these debts or disputed their legitimacy.  Viewed\nin light of the evidence as a whole, and in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation, the Judge\u2019s treatment of this aspect of the case is sustainable.  We conclude that the\nJudge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable\n\ncharacterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified\nany harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a\nwhole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See ISCR Case No. 08-\n11564 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider record evidence of his current good\nfinancial condition, for example that he is in good standing on his credit cards and his automobile\nloan.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See ISCR Case 09-\n05830 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2010).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut\nthat presumption, nor to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or\ncapricious manner.\n \nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge has cogently explained his decision,\nboth as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 27, 2009, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the Government\u2019s\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 18, 2010, and responded with additional\ninformation within the 30 days permitted.  The case was assigned to me on April 27,\n2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nJune 30, 2010\n\n2\n \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) been charged and convicted\nof forgery in March 2002 and (b) accumulated 32 delinquent debts exceeding $33,000. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have demonstrated questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations by virtue of his (a) actions covered by his 2002 forgery conviction, (b) his\nJanuary 2004 charge and conviction for driving while ability impaired, and (c) his being\nstopped and cited on at least three different occasions for driving without a valid driver\u2019s\nlicense. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied his forgery charge and conviction.\nHe claimed he was charged and convicted of writing bad checks in August 2002 and\nreceived a deferred sentence (since completed). He admitted many of the alleged\ndelinquent debts. He claimed most of these debts were paid in full, or covered by\npayment plans.  He also denied the legitimacy of many of the alleged debts, claiming\nthere is no record of any these debts in his updated October 2009 credit report.\nApplicant admitted his driving while impaired arrest. He admitted having a\nsuspended license on the occasions he was stopped and cited, but offered\nexplanations.  He claimed his license violations were correctable ones and do not cast\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old systems administrator for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army after graduating from high school in 1997.\nHe served on active duty with the Army between April 1998 and April 2001, and was\nhonorably discharged in April 2001. Item 1.  Applicant married in April 2001 and has\none child from this marriage.  He and his wife separated in January 2002.  See Item 6.  \nFinances\nFollowing his Army discharge, Applicant encountered difficulties finding work.  He\nwas unemployed between June 2001 and August 2001.  While he was unemployed, he\nlived with his parents (Item 7), and essentially lived paycheck-to-paycheck during this\nperiod. To defray his living expenses, he opened multiple checking accounts, using\nfictitious names and social security numbers.  See Item 7.  \nDuring late 2001 and early 2002, he opened three different checking accounts\nusing fake identification (IDs) for each of the accounts.  See Item 11. Typically, he\nwrote checks on these accounts that ranged in amounts from $250 to $350 a check.\nItem 7. He made each of the checks out to \u201ccash,\u201d forged his signature on these fake\n\n3\naccounts and cashed the checks. With the proceeds, he took care of his living\nexpenses.  Item 7.  \nApplicant used each fake bank account he created for approximately five days in\na row. Item 7.  When he made the mistake of using the same account for seven days\n(in March 2002), he was caught, arrested, and charged with forgery (a felony).  \nFor the first six months following his April 2001 separation, Applicant relied\nmostly on his parents for income.  Over the course of the ensuing five years, he worked\nsporadically on term job assignments that would last anywhere from one week to three\nmonths in duration.  \nBetween March 2002 and May 2003, Applicant was unemployed. Without\nincome, he fell further behind with his bills.  Records document that between June 2001\nand May 2003, Applicant accumulated about 32 delinquent debts exceeding $33,000.\nIn December 2002, Applicant was informed by an anonymous postal letter that\nhis separated spouse had given birth to a baby.  After several unsuccessful attempts to\nget back together, he and his wife reunited in January 2004.\nApplicant has since become gainfully employed. Since his deployment to Iraq\nwith his present employer in 2007, Applicant has paid off most of his listed debts.  He\ndocuments fully paid receipts for seventeen of his listed debts totaling $16,950 in\neliminated delinquent accounts. Specifically, he documents payment in full of the\ncreditor 1.b debt (AE 4), creditor 1.c (AE 5), creditors 1.d through 1.g (AE 6), creditor 1.j\n(AE 7), creditors 1.l through 1.o (AE 10), creditor 1.q (AE11), creditors 1.u through 1.x\n(AE 12), and creditor 1.ff (AE 13). These payments are not yet reflected in Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent credit report. See AE 1.\nHowever, Applicant does not provide any documentation of payment of his\nremaining debts listed in the SOR.  While most of his still delinquent accounts report\nsmall balances (i.e., creditors 1.h and 1.i, creditor 1.p, creditors 1.r through 1.t, and\ncreditors 1.y through 1.ee), several are large: notably creditor 1.k ($1,361), creditors 1.r\nthrough 1.t, creditor 1.y ($7,326), and creditor 1.gg ($3,135). Applicant claimed no\nknowledge of any of these debts listed on his credit reports and denies any debts due\nto these creditors.  See Item 4. These debts are not reported in his most recent credit\nreport, but are not otherwise explained.  He provides no letters or other evidence,\nthough, of inquiring about these reported debts from the listed creditors or challenging\nthe debts with the credit reporting agencies.\nApplicant currently reports a net monthly income of $9,166 and monthly\nexpenses of $3,592.  See AE 14.  He reports a net monthly remainder of $4,407.  \nApplicant\u2019s forgery conviction, while somewhat dated, still reflects concerted\nattempts by Applicant to misappropriate funds (by writing on forged or fictitious\naccounts) he was not entitled to.  He completed his probation conditions in 2007.\n\n4\nAlcohol-related offense and traffic citations\nIn January 2004, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI)\nwhile driving home from work.  He had consumed approximately six drinks after his shift\nand made a regrettable decision to drive home. See Item 7. While driving home, he was\nconfronted by a male driver in another car at a stop light. Applicant and this driver\nengaged in a race with their vehicles.  At one point, they were traveling at high rates of\nspeed and became involved in an accident that culminated in Applicant\u2019s rolling his\nvehicle.  See Item 7.  \nThe police officer who investigated the accident asked Applicant for his drivers\nlicense and vehicle registration. When Applicant could not produce his license and\nregistration (claiming he lost his wallet), the investigating officer charged Applicant with\na fictitious license plate and escorted him to a local hospital for treatment.  Once inside\nthe hospital, Applicant submitted to a blood alcohol test. After registering a blood\nalcohol level that suggested he was impaired, the police officer  transported Applicant\nto a local jail where he was charged with DUI and released.  \nFollowing his release from jail, Applicant returned to the scene of the accident to\nsearch for his wallet.  Item 7.  He found his wallet in the grass about 20 feet from the\nsite where his car came to a rest.  \nAt his hearing in 2003, Applicant pled guilty to a reduced charge of driving while\nability impaired (DWAI) and was sentenced to two years in jail (deferred) and ordered to\nperform 24 days of community service.  Applicant, in turn was assigned a court date to\nassess his compliance with the court\u2019s conditions. His deferred sentence was\nconditioned on the following: 40 hours of community service and completion of a Level\nII alcohol education class.  \nFollowing several appearances in court without his attorney present, the court\nordered Applicant to serve 45 days in jail.  Applicant was credited with serving 45 days\nof jail time between September 2007 and October 2007. The court also credited him\nwith completing his other pre-trial conditions and dismissed the DWAI charges.  Item 7. \nBetween July 2005 and April 2007, Applicant was cited on three occasions for\ndriving without a license, or on a suspended license.  In July 2005, he was cited for\ndriving without a license and driving under denied conditions.  Item 7.   By all accounts,\nhe paid the imposed fines.  \nIn his answer and post-hearing response, Applicant claimed that he had a valid\nlicense from another  state when stopped by in-state police  on each of the three\noccasions in which he was stopped by police. See Items 4 and 7. He provided no\ndocumentation, however, to corroborate his claims. He assured, though, that he has\nsince surrendered his out-of-state driver\u2019s license to his state\u2019s driving authority, and\nanticipates no future citations for not having a valid state license.\nApplicant provides several endorsement letters and a certificate of appreciation.\nSee Items 19 through 24.  \n\n5\n                      \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole-person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguideline is pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\n\n6\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a systems administrator who accumulated a number of delinquent\ndebts during periods of unemployment and underemployment. His accumulation of\ndelinquent debts, and his use of fictitious checking accounts to cover his expenses\n\n7\nduring periods of financial difficulty and his unwillingness to address his delinquent\ndebts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged debts are attributable to his experiencing financial\nproblems during periods of unemployment between June 2001 and May 2002.  Based\non the documented materials in the FORM, some extenuating circumstances are\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s inability to pay off or otherwise resolve his debts.  As a\nresult, MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibly,\u201d is partly available to Applicant.\n,.\nApplicant\u2019s use of fictitious checking accounts to sustain him during periods of\nunemployment are not easily reconcilable with eligibility requirements for holding a\nsecurity clearance.  Moreover, some judgment problems persist, too, over Applicant\u2019s\nunexplained  delinquencies and his failure to demonstrate he acted responsibly in\naddressing his listed debts before he received the SOR. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at\n3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004). Not only are several of his listed debt delinquencies still\nunresolved, but he has failed to document any disputes with the underlying creditors\nand credit reporting agencies. Probative evidence of mitigation is not demonstrated by\nApplicant based on available documentation.      \n                                          \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on Government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\nGovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts raises\nsecurity-significant concerns about whether the applicant has demonstrated the trust\nand judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts, and his use of\nfictitious checking accounts to pay his bills during periods of unemployment and\nfinancial difficulties. While he has since completed his probation conditions and repaid\nmost of his listed delinquent debts, he has not established any seasoned track record\nfor paying his debts and overcoming trust doubts attributable to his forgery conviction.\nBringing closure to those listed debts he disputes is a critical prerequisite to his\nregaining control of his  finances and mitigating financial concerns.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s endorsement letters and certificate of appreciation are helpful\nin evaluating his overall judgment and trustworthiness, they are not enough to\novercome the trust deficiencies manifest from his delinquent account history and\nforgery conviction.  Overall, a clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on\n\n8\nthe limited amount of information available for consideration in this record does not\nenable him to establish judgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome security\nconcerns arising out of his accumulation of delinquent debts and forgery conviction.\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, his lack of explanations for his challenged debts, and\nhis forgery conviction, it is too soon to make safe predictive judgments about\nApplicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his finances to acceptable levels\ncommensurate with the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.h through 1.i, 1.k, 1.p, 1.r through 1.t, 1.y through 1.ee, and\n1.gg.  Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the remaining allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.b through 1.g, 1.j, 1.l through 1.o, 1.q, 1.u through 1.x,\nand 1.ff. \nPersonal Conduct concerns\nJudgment and trustworthiness concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\npattern of judgment and trust lapses associated with his writing checks on fictitious\nchecks over a two-year period between 2001 and 2002.  Concerns are also raised\nabout the circumstances associated with his 2004 alcohol-related conviction and his\ntraffic convictions involving his driving on an invalid out-of-state license. Together,\nthese three incidents reflect pattern deficiencies in the exercise of good judgment and\nmaintenance of trustworthiness.  \nApplicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to\ncognizance under this Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No.\n06-20964, at 6 (App. Bd. April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is  probative adverse\ninformation covered by Guideline E which reflects a recurring pattern of questionable\njudgment use, trust breaches, or candor lapses, grounds exist for considering the\nallegations covered by Guideline E.\nUnder Guideline E, two disqualifying conditions are specifically applicable to\nApplicant\u2019s situation. Both DC \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or\nother characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation,\u201d and DC \u00b6 16(f), \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by\nthe individual to the employer as a condition of employment,\u201d have some application\nto the facts of the case. \nBased on his explanations for his traffic citations and the age of his alcohol-\nrelated conviction, Applicant is entitled to take some advantage of MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\n\n9\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and\nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and MC \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d of\nthe personal conduct guideline. His forgery conviction, however, reflects a pattern of\ndeceit and fraud that cannot be easily reconciled with the trustworthiness\nrequirements for clearance holders.  \nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment and trust questions raised by his forgery conviction. His endorsement letters\nand training certification are favorable to him and warrant consideration when\nevaluating his overall reliability and trustworthiness.  It is too soon, though, to absolve\nApplicant from questions about his trustworthiness that have resulted from his forgery\nconviction.  \nApplicant does not mitigate security concerns raised under the personal\nconduct guideline. Unfavorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraph 2.a.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto the allegations covered by subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors enumerated in AG 2(a).\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR, I make the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubpara.  1.a:\n                \n     Against Applicant\nSubparas. 1.b through 1.g:                           For Applicant\nSubparas. 1.h and 1.i:\n     Against Applicant\nSubpara.  1.j:\n     For Applicant\nSubpara.  1.k:\n     Against Applicant\nSubparas. 1.l through 1.o:\n     For Applicant\nSubpara.  1.p:\n     Against Applicant\nSubpara.  1.q:\n     For Applicant\nSubparas. 1.r through 1.t:\n    Against Applicant\nSubparas. 1.u through 1.x:\n     For Applicant\nSubparas. 1.y through 1.ee:\n    Against Applicant\nSubpara.  1.ff:\n    For Applicant\nSubpara.  1.gg:\n    Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n    AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\n    Against Applicant\nSubpara. 2.b:\n    For Applicant\nSubpara. 2.c:\n    For Applicant\n\n10\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 40 years old. He is unmarried, but was married from 1990 through 1997, and he has two children with his ex-wife, two other children from a previous relationship and a fifth child, for whom the court has ordered him to pay child support.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\n     For Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 21, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 28, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on September 18, 2009. DOHA first issued a notice of hearing on\nNovember 16, 2009, and the hearing was first convened on December 17, 2009.  The\nhearing was not concluded on the first day of hearing, and a second day of hearing was\nrequired. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 18, 2009, and the second day\n\n2\nof hearing was scheduled to be heard on January 21, 2010. Because of calendar\nconflicts, DOHA issued a second notice of hearing on January 14, 2010, for the second\nday of hearing,  and the second day of hearing was scheduled to be heard on February\n4, 2010. On February 3, 2010, because of personal issues, the second hearing day was\ncancelled and taken off calendar. DOHA issued a fourth notice of hearing on March 2,\n2010, and the hearing was scheduled to be heard on March 18, 2010. DOHA issued a\nfifth notice of hearing on March 16, 2010, and I convened the second day of hearing on\nApril 12, 2010. \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through I at the\ntime of the first hearing, which were also admitted without objection. After the second\nday of hearing, I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 19, 2010\nto submit additional documents. He timely submitted several additional documents at\nthe second day of hearing, which have been identified and entered into evidence as\nExhibits J through L. He also submitted a number of documents post hearing second\nday that have been identified and entered into evidence collectively as Exhibit M. DOHA\nreceived the transcript for the first day of the hearing (Tr) on January 4, 2010, and the\ntranscript for the second day of the hearing on April 21, 2010. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the admitted\ndocuments, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is unmarried, but was married from 1990 through\n1997, and he has two children with his ex-wife, two other children from a previous\nrelationship and a fifth child, for whom the court has ordered him to pay child support.\nHe was in the United States Navy from 1986 to 1997, and he received an Honorable\nDischarge. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists five allegations (1.a. through 1.e.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  All of the allegations will be discussed below in the\nsame order as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,654.  At the\nhearing, Applicant testified that this debt was for a student loan, as was 1.b. (Tr at 30.)\nHe stated that both of these loans had been in default, but he had been making\npayments of $150 month for approximately one year with a total amount of $2,000, and\nthe loan had been removed from the default category. Exhibit F, which is a letter from\n\n3\nthe Settlement Unit for the college funds owed by Applicant, dated October 28, 2009,\nindicated that Applicant\u2019s two education loans were rehabilitated and are no longer in\ndefault. Applicant now pays $70 a month on these two loans per the agreement, since\nhe has now rehabilitated the loans. (Tr at 36-38.)\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,510. Applicant\ntestified that this debt, also for a student loan, has also been removed from the default\ncategory, as reviewed in 1.a., above. Exhibit F confirms that this debt has been\nrehabilitated.\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,200. Applicant\ntestified that this loan is for child support, which he has been paying in various amounts.\n(Exhibit 3.) He averred that he was ordered to make payments for a child of whom he\nhad not been aware, and he is still not certain of the paternity.  He indicated that he was\nin arrears because the court had ordered him to make child support payments, but he\nhad not received notice of the order for several years.  When he went to renew his\nlicense in another state in 2007, that was when he learned of this debt. His wages are\nnow being garnished to make payments on this debt. \nApplicant testified that he has never been arrears for child support with the two\nchildren he had with his ex-wife. However, he also was paying child support for a child\nborn out of wedlock, and he testified that he was in arrears for the child support of one\nof these children. (Tr at 78-83.)\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,642. Applicant\ntestified that this debt is the same as 1.a., above. (Tr at 41-42.) He pointed to Exhibit F,\nthe letter from the Settlement Unit for the college funds, which refers to two student\nloans, not the three, as are listed on the SOR. He also testified that he had only taken\nout two education loans. (Tr at 62.) I find that this debt is a duplicate of 1.a., above. \n1e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $294. Applicant\ntestified that he is unaware of the origin of this debt, and since it is not listed on his\ncredit report, he is unable to contact a creditor to inquire as to its origin. He is willing and\nable to pay this debt, and has actually purchased a money order in the amount of $294\nto pay this debt but he cannot locate the creditor, so he is unable to do so. (Tr at 56-58.)\nApplicant testified that he got into financial difficulty after his sister died on 2002,\nas she had four children, his nephew and three nieces, for whom he took responsibility\nafter her death. He also had his own business as a mechanic from August 2001 through\nAugust 2006, and he indicated that, at times, the business was not very lucrative. He\nthen became unemployed, so he decided to return to school, and he received a\ncertificate in power plant maintenance, jet engines and reciprocating engines. (Tr at 39-\n46.) This led to his education loan problems, as discussed above.\nDuring the first day of hearing, based on new information elicited at the hearing\nby the cross examination of Applicant, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR,\n\n4\nand add additional allegations. The following are the two new allegations which were\nadded to the SOR:\n1.f.  \u201cYou failed to file your Federal and State income tax returns for tax year\n2008.\u201d\n1.g.  \u201cDuring the approximate period of August 2001 to August 2006, you failed to\nreport your full income to the Federal Government.\u201d \nAfter the SOR was amended, at the request of Applicant, the hearing was\ncontinued to give Applicant an opportunity to respond to the new allegations. As\ndiscussed above , the second day of hearing  convened on April 12, 2010.\nAt the second day of hearing Applicant submitted documents partially showing he\nhad finally filed tax returns for tax years 2001 through 2009 on February 5, 2010.\n(Exhibits K and L.)  He testified that he had not previously filed tax returns for those\nyears because he thought he could file the tax returns at a later date. He was not aware\nthey were due on a specific date. (Tr at 44-47.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted documents confirming his Honorable Discharge from the\nNavy on August 1997, and the receipt of several awards and letters of commendation,\nduring his service. (Exhibit M.) \nApplicant submitted a positive character letter in Exhibit E from his manager for\nhis current employer. He was described as someone who is an \u201cextremely trust worthy,\n(sic) ethical and dedicated employee who can be trusted to perform at the highest\nexpectation.\u201d  Applicant also submitted five additional character letters from individuals\nthat have known him in his employment capacity. All of them were extremely positive\nand laudatory. In one letter from one of his managers, it states, \u201cHis professionalism,\nmotivation, and work ethics have always been above reproach.\u201d (Exhibit M.) \nFinally, Applicant submitted post hearing copies of his full Federal and state tax\nreturns for years 2001 through 2009. (Exhibit M.)  Based on the limited income made by\nApplicant for these years, the returns showed that Applicant did not owe any Federal or\nstate tax for any of these years. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems resulted, in part, from the period\nwhen he was unemployed or received reduced income. He also took on the\nresponsibility of taking care of the four children of his sister after her death. Applicant\nhas made a legitimate and good-faith effort towards making payments on his two\nstudent loans and bringing them out of default mode, he is paying on his child support\narrearage, which occurred because he was not aware of the order of the court for him to\nmake payments. I find that Applicant has acted responsibly. Therefore, I find that this\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nRegarding the failure to file tax returns for tax years 2001 through 2008,\nApplicant did violate the law by failing to file tax returns, even if he was unaware of his\nduty to do so.  However, Applicant has attempted to mitigate the clear legal violation by\nfinally filing returns for those years, and since no money had been owed to the Federal\nor state Governments for those years, this issue is not adverse under Financial\nConcerns. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Financial Concerns of\nthe Government.\n\n7\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Condition applies, together with the very strong\nrecommendations on his behalf and his honorable service to the United States Navy, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 49 years old, married, and has two children born in the United States. He owns a home in the United States, and a gas station with a partner. Applicant was born in Iraq, and came to the United States in May 1997 with his wife. He became a U.S. citizen in August 2006.

On April 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 26, 2009, \nand I received the case assignment on May 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \n \n1 The SOR spelling of Applicant\u2019s name is incorrect.  Applicant corrected it on the record, and his SF 86 contains \nthe correct spelling, which is used in the caption of this Decision. \nOctober 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \non June 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through C.  Department Counsel did not \nobject to Exhibits A and B, but did object to Exhibit C because it was not translated into \nEnglish.  I granted Applicant additional time to obtain a certified translation, which he did \non July 2, 2009.  Department Counsel argued in his transmittal memorandum that little \nor no weight should be given to Exhibit C as translated because of enumerated \ndiscrepancies as set forth in the memorandum. I admitted the exhibit into evidence. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009. The record closed on \nJuly 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 14, 15) The request and the attached documents \nwere admitted into evidence and were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit 4. The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, married, and has two children born in the United \nStates. He owns a home in the United States, and a gas station with a partner.  \nApplicant was born in Iraq, and came to the United States in May 1997 with his wife.  \nHe became a U.S. citizen in August 2006. He thinks his former Iraqi citizenship was \nrenounced when he obtained U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Iraq. She is \nnot a U.S. citizen, but is a resident alien and citizen of Iraq. Her parents and siblings are \nU.S. residents. Her father is a U.S. citizen, but her mother is not a citizen. (Tr. 17-19, \n25, 39, 45, 93-95; Exhibits 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iraq.  His mother is a retired \nteacher and receives an Iraqi government pension.  His mother had cancer a few years \nago when Applicant was working for a government contractor in Iraq.  When he called \nher once or twice a week to inquire about her health, he told his mother he was calling \nfrom California.  He spoke with his father at the same time.  Two of Applicant\u2019s sisters \nalso live in his parent\u2019s house in Iraq. He spoke with them at the same time.  Applicant \nspoke with his parents a few days prior to this hearing.  At the present time, he speaks \nwith his parents on his mother\u2019s cell phone about once a month.  Applicant describes \nhis relationship with his mother as \u201cvery good.\u201d (Tr. 27-31, 46-52; Exhibits 1-3) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has one brother living in Iraq.  A second brother died in 2008, but \nApplicant did not attend his funeral in Iraq because of the restrictions on his job with the \ngovernment contractor. His deceased brother was a police officer in Iraq. His living \nbrother is older than Applicant, and is a citizen of Iraq. He drives a taxicab for a living, \nand has a wife and child. Applicant last saw his brother in 2007. Applicant speaks with \nhis brother frequently and has a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with him. (Tr. 53-60; Exhibits 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq.  He telephoned \nthem the week before the hearing, and speaks with them monthly. The older sister lives \nwith his parents and is not employed. Applicant describes his relationship with this sister \nas \u201cvery close.\u201d Applicant has a younger sister who is married to a man who owns a \nbakery. This sibling relationship is also close. (Tr. 61-66; Exhibits 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant has about 15 aunts and seven uncles in Iraq. He also has many \ncousins living in Iraq. Applicant has a very good relationship with all these family \nmembers in Iraq. Applicant describes it as a close knit family. (Tr. 66-68, 88; Exhibits 1-\n3) \n \n \nEven though the SF 86 states Applicant bought a house in Iraq during 2002, he \nadmitted at the hearing the actual purchase was made in 2004 through a local Iraq \nattorney.  Applicant used $38,000 obtained from the sale of his wife\u2019s gold jewelry and \nother gold objects. He allowed his parents to live there for free from 2004 to 2006.  Then \nhe permitted a poor family to live in his house without rent payments from 2006 to 2008.  \nApplicant transferred ownership of the house to his wife in March 2009 after some \nfriends told him to sell or transfer the house if he wanted to be hired by a government \ncontractor and obtain a security clearance.  Applicant declared in March 2009 on his \ninterrogatories that he owned the Iraqi house and its value was about $50,000. The \ntranslation of the deed, or \u201ctemporary processing form,\u201d as it is labeled in the document \nsubmitted by Applicant, contains several illegible entries, and lists three persons who \nare to receive shares in the house. It is unclear from the document who owns the \nhouse, particularly because Applicant\u2019s name does not appear on the translated \ndocument.  I do not give this exhibit or its translation any weight.  Applicant intends to \nreturn to Iraq someday in the future and live in that house.  Applicant will reclaim Iraqi \ncitizenship when he returns to Iraq to live. (Tr. 32, 33, 37, 68-86, 91; Exhibits 1, C) \n \n \nApplicant travelled to Iraq in 2001 with his wife. He travelled there in 2007 alone. \nHe visited his aunts and uncles on that later visit, in addition to other relatives.  \nApplicant stayed about 45 days on each visit. He resided with his parents on each trip. \n(Tr. 83-88; Exhibits 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a statement from his supervisor about his employment since \n2008, which was described as exemplary. She characterized Applicant as a reliable and \ntrustworthy employee. Applicant submitted another person\u2019s statement about his \nexpertise in translations which aided the efforts the company was making in Iraq.  \nApplicant worked there from July to October 2008. Applicant also submitted a certificate \n\n \n4 \n \n \nof achievement for his efforts from November 2008 to January 2009 from a military \nofficer involved in certain activities in Iraq. (Tr. 20; Exhibits A and B)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iraq is a Middle Eastern country \nwith 27 million people. In 2003, the United States led a United Nations coalition to \nremove Saddam Hussein, a long-serving dictator, from power in Iraq. A parliamentary \ndemocracy was created pursuant to a new 2005 constitution. After free elections in \n2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. The Parliament was elected for a four-year \nterm. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq had much violence, perpetrated \nby Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis.  \nAlthough the new governmental has taken aggressive action against terrorists, the \nthreat of terrorism in Iraq remains high, as do human rights abuses. Terrorist groups \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  For the past \n18 months, the large increase in U.S. combat troops in Iraq has substantially reduced \nviolence. These troops were aided by Iraqi soldiers and Sunni local forces that formerly \nsupported the Al Qaeda insurrection. In Northern Iraq, the Kurdish local government \nforces maintain a more peaceful environment for the residents than elsewhere in Iraq. \n(Exhibit 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n5 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  The following four disqualifying conditions are applicable to this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and parents are citizens of Iraq. His three siblings, fifteen aunts, \nseven uncles, and numerous cousins live in Iraq and are citizens of that country.  \nApplicant has at least monthly telephone contact with his parents, siblings, and other \nrelatives. Applicant described his relationships with his family members as close and \nvery good. He owns real estate in Iraq valued at $50,000. All of these connections \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion, particularly because of Applicant\u2019s stated intention to return to Iraq in the \nfuture and live in the house he purchased in 2004 with his wife\u2019s gold. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \nmitigating conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his family living in Iraq is close.  Terrorism remains a \nconcern there as the country rebuilds after the Hussein era and the past six years of \ninstability.  Applicant\u2019s sister is a business owner, and he owns real estate in Iraq.  With \nthese connections, Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between \nhis family\u2019s interests, the Iraq government\u2019s interests, and the interests of the United \nStates.  This concern is heightened because Applicant intends to return to live in Iraq in \nhis $50,000 house.  AG \u00b6 8 (a) does not apply. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant has a conflict of interest between his loyalty to family and real estate in \nIraq, and his loyalty to the United States. He has only been in the United States for 12 \nyears, compared to 37 years in Iraq. He has not established significant connections to \nthe United States to balance his strong connections to Iraq. Applicant also has close \nfamilial connections to his numerous relatives in Iraq, speaking with them monthly. It is \nnot clear that Applicant will resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  \nAG \u00b6 8 (b) does not apply. \n \n \nThe Directive clearly states any doubt in security clearance cases must be \nresolved in favor of national security. I have great doubts about Applicant based on his \nreal estate in Iraq and the murky alleged transaction with his wife to transfer title to her \nmade this year. Applicant also wants to return to Iraq to live, and this declaration \nstrengthens the doubt about him under AG \u00b6 2(b), and it clearly applies here.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, and \nknowingly purchased property in Iraq with the intention of making it his home in the \nfuture.  While he became a U.S. citizen in 2006, his connections to Iraq remain strong \nand continuing. He diminished his credibility by his conflicting statements about the title \nto his Iraqi house. The transfer of title to his wife in March 2009 seems to be a paper \ntransaction designed to obfuscate the true ownership of the house in an attempt to \nobtain a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s consistent contact with his family members in \nIraq, which has not altered over time, including up to the time of the hearing, shows \nvoluntary actions and no behavior changes. These actions will continue and create \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his foreign influence. I \nconclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86) \n(GE 1). On July 19, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nan SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 7, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline M (use of information \ntechnology systems). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) \n \nOn August 9, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nreceived Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) Applicant requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On November 1, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to \nproceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On November 8, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case \nto me. On November 18, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) Applicant waived \nhis right to 15 days notice of his hearing. (Tr. 13-14) On November 22, 2010, Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. \n20). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5. (Tr. 21) Additionally, I admitted \nthe hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR as hearing exhibits. (HE \n1-3) On December 1, 2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open until \nJanuary 28, 2011, to permit Applicant to submit documentation. (Tr. 64-66, 108) On \nJanuary 28, 2011, I received four additional documents from Applicant. (AE A-D) \nDepartment Counsel noted that a letter from Mr. B was hearsay and urged that it \nreceive less weight. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s proffered exhibits are admitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he denied all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) \nHowever, with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.f, he said he received some training. (HE 3) His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (Tr. 5)2 He received \na master of science degree in electrical engineering in February 1982. (Tr. 5-6) He \nmarried in 1980 and divorced in 1985. His children were born in 1980 and 1981.

He did not disclose any illegal drug use or alcohol-related offenses on his \nJuly 23, 2007, SF 86.  \n \nUse of information technology systems \n \nApplicant is a network professional with almost 30 years of experience. (Tr. 17, \n48) Each of the incidents alleged in the SOR occurred. (Tr. 17)  Applicant began \nworking as a senior systems integration analyst for a major government contractor in \nApril 2005. (GE 1) Applicant was responsible for installation, configuration, and \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n2Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant\u2019s July 23, \n2007 SF 86 and his resume. (GE 1, 5)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmaintenance of a multi-million dollar network monitoring system (NMS). (GE 4) \nApplicant periodically downloaded software from his employer\u2019s site. (Tr. 43-44; GE 4) \nHe said his downloads of patches were authorized by his manager. (GE 4) Applicant\u2019s \nmanager, Mr. B, provided the following statement after the hearing: \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] job responsibilities included managing the [NMS]. This \nsystem required periodic maintenance that required downloading and \ninstalling software patches from the [NMS] company site. It also required \nother maintenance including, but not limited to providing \u201cview only\u201d \ncontrolled access to their [NMS] appliances via Webex, as well as other \nneeded [NMS], as well as other needed [NMS] related activities. \n[Company] security was asked several times for the permission to conduct \nmost of these activities and, in every case, permission (sometimes just \nverbal) was granted. (AE A) \n \nThe NMS downloads triggered intrusion detection systems. (GE 4) Applicant \nexplained that security protocols often permit actions to occur which are forbidden even \nthough the security protocols could stop the actions from occurring. It is like prohibiting \nentry through a door and then keeping \u201c\u2018the door open but we will shoot everybody who \ngoes through that door.\u2019 That\u2019s the policy for lack of a better explanation.\u201d (Tr. 50)   \n \nOn February 10, 2006, Applicant\u2019s employer issued a report of investigation \n(ROI) which cited him for several violations of information security rules. (GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed six allegations, which are all discussed in the ROI and at his \nhearing.  \n \nApplicant was working for about two weeks at the government worksite when he \nremoved a laptop computer from a secure network, and allegedly connected the laptop \ncomputer to another government agency\u2019s network, and then connected the laptop \ncomputer back into the secure network. (Tr. 51-52; GE 2 at 1-2; SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant \nsaid the laptop was not actually connected to other government agency\u2019s network. (Tr. \n109) He used a data capture from the other government agency, and then used the \nlaptop to evaluate the data capture. (Tr. 109)3 The contractor purchased the laptop \ncomputer with special software valued at about $150,000 for use on a government \ncomputer network. (Tr. 28, 51) The laptop computer was not equipped with antivirus \nsoftware or fully patched with updates. (GE 2 at 1-2; HE 2) Applicant was unaware that \nthe laptop did not have adequate anti-virus software. (Tr. 39-40) Moving this laptop \ncomputer from a trusted network to an untrusted network, and then back to the trusted \nnetwork, can compromise the trusted network because vulnerabilities are possibly \ntransferred to the DoD\u2019s trusted network. (Tr. 28-29; GE 2 at 1-2; HE 2) A vulnerable \ncomputer or network is easier for a hacker to compromise. (Tr. 30) Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor asked him to use the laptop computer to troubleshoot the other network, and \nApplicant complied with the request. (Tr. 51-52) After he completed the mission, he was \n \n3 Evaluation of a \u201cdata capture\u201d avoids the necessity for a connection to an untrusted network \nbecause the data is evaluated separately from the network.   \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncomplimented at a meeting for his successful endeavor. (Tr. 52) Because Applicant \nprudently used a \u201cdata capture\u201d the DoD network was not compromised. \n  \nApplicant connected an encrypted tunnel to his home computer, which violated \nsecurity controls and potentially created a tunnel to a private or commercial network. \n(GE 2 at 2; SOR \u00b6 1.b) Theoretically, a tunnel to a home computer might have permitted \na hacker or other person with malicious intent to use Applicant\u2019s home computer to \nbypass the DoD network\u2019s security systems. (Tr. 30-32) However, Applicant, as a \ncomputer expert, knew that his home network had superb anti-virus protection, and thus \nthere was no danger posed to the DoD system by Applicant\u2019s violation of the rules. (Tr. \n53) Applicant connected the DoD network to his home computer because he wanted to \nbetter accomplish the DoD mission, using some software resources on his home \ncomputer. (Tr. 52-53)  \n \nApplicant downloaded unauthorized streaming media software to his government \ncomputer. (Tr. 53-55; GE 2 at 2; SOR \u00b6 1.c) Upon inspection, additional unauthorized \nsoftware was found on his government computer. Id. Downloading non-approved \nsoftware is a violation of Army regulations and creates a risk that a virus or other \nmalicious logic will enter a government computer system through the software. (Tr. 32-\n33; GE 2 at 2; SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant was responsible for a major application that was a \nnew system, and he had to constantly download patches to about 20 servers to protect \nthe integrity and functioning of the application. (Tr. 54-55) The first time he applied a \npatch from the website of the owners of the major application, the IDS detected the \ndownload and Applicant talked to security. (Tr. 55, 93) This was the only occasion he \nadvised security of downloading a patch. (Tr. 93) Applicant told his manager that the \nonly way to keep the system running was to download and install the patches and his \nmanager told Applicant to go ahead and do it. (Tr. 55; AE A) He believed his manager \ntalked to security a couple times about it, and his manager was not reprimanded later \nfor absence of security\u2019s advance permission to download the patches. (Tr. 56; AE A) In \naddition, at the direction of another government contractor, Applicant connected the \nserver to a bulletin board type system without pre-authorization from security. (Tr. 56, \n72-73, 93; GE 2 at 2) The bulletin board was for customer service and allowed \ncustomers to efficiently report problems, and it allowed Applicant\u2019s company to \ndocument resolution of those problems. (Tr. 57) Applicant\u2019s goal was not to violate \nsecurity. His goal was to improve efficiency and customer service. (Tr. 76) Applicant \nsaid everyone was aware of the bulletin board system\u2019s use. (Tr. 57)       \n \nOn February 3, 2006, Applicant used a WebEx4 through a secure DoD server to \ncontact a vendor-contractor.5 His use of the server circumvented security controls. (Tr. \n45; GE 2 at 2; SOR \u00b6 1.d) His objective was not to circumvent security. (Tr. 58-59) The \n \n4 A WebEx is an application sharing and conferencing service that allows those who are in \nconference together to see manipulations on their computer screens. In this case, those persons in \nconference could see information and applications on the DoD server.   \n \n5 SOR \u00b6 1.d (the transcript erroneously states SOR \u00b6 1.e) was amended with the consent of the \nparties to conform with the allegation as stated in the February 10, 2006 ROI. (Tr. 96-97)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nintrusion detection system would not detect the intrusion because the use of a WebEx \nappears to be normal traffic. (Tr. 83-84) His goal was to correct a technical problem with \na server. (Tr. 59) Applicant used a WebEx conference with a third party without prior \napproval from security. (Tr. 34-37, 45-46; GE 2 at 1) The third party,6 the vendor that \nlicensed some very expensive software to DoD (software valued at several hundred \nthousand dollars), was located on the West Coast and the system with a problem was \non the East Coast. Applicant did not want the delay and expense of having experts \ntravel from the vendor\u2019s location to the East Coast to work on the server. Applicant \npermitted the vendor to have remote access to the DoD server over the Internet to \ncheck the server. (Tr. 58) Of the five security violations alleged in the SOR, the use of \nthe WebEx conference device to probe a DoD secure server was the most serious \nbecause \u201can uncleared person\u201d from a vendor-corporation \u201cis coming in and looking \ninside a government computer\u201d without the permission or knowledge of security \npersonnel. (Tr. 83, 86) Applicant was able to observe the actions of the vendor, and he \nbelieved he would be able to prevent, and did prevent the vendor from abuse of the \nDoD server. (Tr. 58, 85) Applicant said his corporate supervisors authorized him to use \nthe WebEx, and one supervisor actually participated in the WebEx with Applicant and \nthe third-party vendor. (Tr. 90; AE A) Nevertheless, even if Applicant had explained his \nplan to conduct the WebEx and allow the vendor to troubleshoot the problem under his \ndirect observation, security would have disapproved this proposal. (Tr. 86-87) Applicant \ndisclosed the use of WebEx to security after the fact. (GE 2) However, this breach of \nsecurity rules occurred after Applicant received information assurance awareness \ntraining. Id.   \n \nApplicant used a contractor-owned laptop and software that was purchased to \nwork on a DoD contract for a contract with another federal government agency. (Tr. 40, \n62; SOR \u00b6 1.e) Applicant was the only source of this information. (Tr. 40) Applicant said \nhis supervisors at the government contractor asked him to use the laptop and software \nto assist the other federal government agency. (Tr. 41-42, 63) Applicant said he was \npermitted to use the software on multiple contracts for multiple agencies, and a \ngovernment witness said the use of the laptop and software was restricted to DoD \ncontracts. (Tr. 80, 91) It is possible that the use of the software was restricted to a \nparticular laptop, and not to a particular government agency. (Tr. 81) The licensing \ncontract was not provided, and Applicant likely had more direct knowledge of licensing \nrestrictions than other witnesses. (Tr. 91) I conclude the allegation that Applicant \nviolated the license for the laptop and its software is not substantiated. Nevertheless, as \nstated in SOR \u00b6 1.a, supra, if there was a connection of the laptop and software to \nanother government agency network, the connection would risk the compromise of the \nDoD network, when it was connected back into the DoD network because vulnerabilities \nin the other government agency network could have been transferred to the DoD \nnetwork. (Tr. 81-82) Applicant conceded that from a security standpoint \u201cit was probably \nnot a wise decision;\u201d however, he was under direct orders to assist the other \ngovernment agency. (Tr. 63)  \n \n6 Applicant subsequently received employment from the vendor, and then his employer in 2005 \npurchased the vendor\u2019s company. (Tr. 59-60) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAfter each security-related information technology incident, Applicant received \noral warnings and subsequently he received information-awareness training. (Tr. 66; \nSOR \u00b6 1.f) He said he told security the first time he downloaded software, and the \nresponse was to go ahead. (Tr. 67) The security person providing approval would then \ncontact the intrusion detection team and let them know that the intrusion or download \nwas approved. (Tr. 78) Applicant was involved in various intrusions, which set off \nalarms, and resulted in investigations being initiated or opened. (Tr. 79)  \n \nThere is flexibility in security and information assurance. The network has a \ndesignated approval authority (DAA) who is supposed to make decisions, where \nsecurity processes and procedures can be violated or waived in order to accomplish the \nmission or improve efficiency. (Tr. 74, 77)  \n \nWhen Applicant left his employment with the contractor, he received an award. \nHis departure was under positive terms. (Tr. 18, 59, 70; AE B) \n \nApplicant contended that he knew exactly what he was doing at all times, and the \nDoD information technology system was never at risk. (Tr. 109) He insisted he would \nhave shown poor judgment, if he had challenged the orders of his bosses. (Tr. 110) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in \nthis Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline M (use of information technology systems).  \n \nUse of Information Technology Systems \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern relating to use of information technology \nsystems problems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 40 lists eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n \n(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or \ncomponent thereof; \n \n(b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial \nof access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information \ntechnology system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified information on or to any \nunauthorized software, hardware, or information technology system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations; \n \n(g) negligence or lax security habits in handling information technology \nthat persist despite counseling by management; and \n \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, \nthat results in damage to the national security. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a) and 40(b) do not apply because Applicant did not engage in any \n\u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or component \nthereof,\u201d or any \u201cillegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial \nof access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information technology \nsystem.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(c) and 40(d) do not apply because he did not use \u201cany information \ntechnology system to gain unauthorized access to another system or to a \ncompartmented area within the same system,\u201d and he did not download, store, or \ntransmit any \u201cclassified information on or to any unauthorized software, hardware, or \ninformation technology system.\u201d AG \u00b6 40(h) does not apply because there is no \nevidence of any \u201cdamage to the national security.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e), 40(f), and 40(g) apply because security personnel did not authorize \nApplicant\u2019s use of WebEx software through a secure DoD server to contact a vendor-\ncontractor, and his use of WebEx is prohibited by \u201crules, procedures, guidelines or \nregulations.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.d)7 Applicant received counseling about security procedures in \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s use of WebEx, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, is the only unmitigated security violation. He \neither refuted the other SOR allegations or demonstrated that he acted in good faith, being fully \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nhandling information technology after he violated procedures. He subsequently used \nWebEx without permission, which was a breach of security protocols. Further inquiry \nabout potential applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n \nThree conditions under AG \u00b6 41 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions. \nOn February 3, 2006, Applicant used a WebEx through a secure DoD server to contact \na vendor-contractor. The vendor-contractor located on the West Coast, using WebEx \nentered a DoD server on the East Coast and moved about within the DoD server, \nattempting to troubleshoot a problem. Security or another authorized entity did not \nmonitor the movement within the DoD server. The vendor-contractor did not receive any \nvetting or clearance from security. This was a significant breach of security that \noccurred after Applicant was counseled on several occasions about security \nrequirements. Applicant is exceptionally knowledgeable about information technology. \nHe has an outstanding understanding of the risks involved. Although there is no proof \nthat Applicant\u2019s conduct caused any damage to national security, if other contractors \nwere allowed on their own authority to clearly breach important security requirements, \nanarchy would result. Damage to national security would be inevitable because others \nwho lack Applicant\u2019s experience and skill would not properly monitor the breach of \nsecurity, or would take risks, assuming they had the requisite skill and knowledge to \nprevent damage to the information technology systems.  \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, he emphasized his good-faith desire to accomplish his \nmission and his company\u2019s requirements; however, he acknowledged the vendor-\ncontractor, who breached security protocols, could have traveled to the DoD server, as \nopposed to using the WebEx. Additionally, Applicant could have sought security \napproval or a waiver from the designated approval authority, and he did not do so. \nBecause Applicant was unwilling to fully accept the DoD security requirements as \n \nknowledgeable that his actions would not cause actual harm to security. His violations of security rules \nwere based on the belief that they would facilitate mission accomplishment, and it is noteworthy that in \n2005-2006, when the violations occurred, he had very limited experience working with DoD security.     \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ntrumping his or his company\u2019s perception of mission requirements, I am not convinced \nthat the breach of security occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. \nThere is some residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to complying \nwith security requirements when those requirements result in inefficiency or \ncompromise timely mission accomplishment. His presentation of mitigation evidence is \ninsufficient to fully mitigate use of information technology systems security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline M in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant is 51 years old, and he is sufficiently mature to \nunderstand and comply with security requirements. He received a master of science \ndegree in electrical engineering. Applicant is a network professional with almost 30 \nyears of experience. In 2005-2006, as a senior systems integration analyst for a major \ngovernment contractor, Applicant was responsible for installation, configuration, and \nmaintenance of a multi-million dollar network monitoring system. He worked diligently \non this project, and his employer praised him for his hard work and superb results. His \nmost recent security violation was in February 2006, which is not recent. He deserves \nsubstantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government, as an employee of a \ncontractor. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his \nemployer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. I give \nApplicant substantial credit for admitting most of the underlying facts relating to the \nbreaches of security, as alleged in the SOR. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Applicant violated security rules relating to information \ntechnology. He was counseled about compliance with security rules. For example, \nsecurity rules were violated when patches were installed without advance permission \nfrom security. Applicant observed that when permission to install patches was sought, it \nwas always granted, and when patches were downloaded without security\u2019s permission, \nno adverse action beyond oral discussions with security personnel resulted. Applicant \ninterpreted this as a green light to install patches without security permission. He was \nexceptionally knowledgeable about information technology issues, and he had a \ntendency to believe his expertise allowed him to violate security rules, which are \nprimarily designed to protect information technology systems from software downloads \nand other information technology-related actions by those without his expertise. He was \naware of the security requirement to seek permission before using software such as \nWebEx on a secure server. Nevertheless, he allowed a vendor-contractor to enter the \nDoD server through a secure DoD server using WebEx, which is a major violation of \nDoD security protocols. This breach of security was unnecessary because Applicant \ncould have taken other actions to meet mission requirements. He should have sought \npermission from security or the designated approval authority for that system to \nundertake the WebEx, and explained the option of bringing an expert from the West \nCoast to the server location on the East Coast to make on-site repairs. Ultimately, it was \nnot Applicant or his company\u2019s decision whether security protocols should be violated or \nwaived for reasons of mission accomplishment. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s reliance on his \nproject manager\u2019s statement is misplaced. His project manager does not have the \nauthority to authorize Applicant to violate security rules and protocols. I am not \nconvinced Applicant would comply with DoD security protocols or seek a waiver, if he \nviewed those DoD security protocols as frustrating his efforts to accomplish his \ncompany\u2019s mission.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude use of information \ntechnology systems security concerns are not fully mitigated, and he is not eligible for \naccess to classified information at this time.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Biel Jr., Esq. \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. The record shows Applicant has a\nhistory of financial problems or difficulties as shown by nine delinquent debts ranging in\namounts from $130 to $8,536, for a total of approximately $21,000. The record also\nshows he has paid or settled five debts, two debts are in repayment plans, the collection\nlawsuit for one debt should be dismissed soon, and one debt is a duplicate. The record\ncontains sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.\nAccordingly, as explained below, this case is decided for Applicant.\nDecember 4, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibits 1 and 1A. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on February 17, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint as it detailed the\nfactual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me August 5, 2009. The hearing took place September 23,\n2009. The record was left open until October 14, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and the post-\nhearing matters are marked and admitted, without objections, as follows: (1) Exhibit\nC\u2013credit report, dated September 29, 2009; (2) Exhibit D\u2013collection letter, dated April\n20, 2009, and proof of payment, dated June 29, 2009; and (3) Exhibit E\u2013notice of\nnonsuit, dated October 6, 2009, and proposed order of nonsuit. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived October 1, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a federal contractor, and he works as an\navionics technician. He began his current employment in May 2008, and he completed\na security-clearance application in August 2008.  This is the first time he has applied for\n2\nan industrial security clearance. The application required him to respond to questions\nabout his background. In response to questions about his financial record, he disclosed\na delinquent auto loan and a delinquent line of credit for his business. In addition, he\ndisclosed a criminal matter (an NSF check) in 2005, when he withheld payment to a\nvendor due to a business dispute.   \nApplicant is married and has three children, one from his first marriage and two\nfrom his current marriage. His children, ages 30, 23, and 21, although not minors, still\nreceive financial support from him. The 30-year-old and 21-year-old are attending\ncollege while the 23-year-old is employed. The two youngest children live with\nApplicant.\n\n Tr. 61\u201363. \n3\n Nonsuit means a \u201cvoluntary dismissal of a case or a defendant, without a decision on the merits.\u201d Black\u2019s\n4\nLaw Dictionary 1158 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9  ed. W est 2009). \nth\n3\nHis employment history includes a period of self-employment during 1994\u20132006,\nwhen he was the owner-operator of a small avionics company. In about mid-2005,\nApplicant sold the business to an employee. He sold it for personal reasons (e.g.,\ndeaths in the family) as opposed to business reasons as the company was then\nprofitable. The terms of the sale were rather loose or informal; there was no written\ncontract for sale, merely an oral agreement that the buyer would make monthly\ninstallment payments to Applicant once the business became profitable for the new\nowner. The idea was the installment payments would supplement Applicant\u2019s income\nuntil he resumed full-time employment, which he did in April 2006, with another avionics\ncompany. \nThe new owner was unsuccessful, resulting in Applicant taking the business back\nin about February 2006. Thereafter, Applicant liquidated the business\u2019s assets and\nclosed the company. Altogether, Applicant estimates the business failure cost him\n$60,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.  The vast majority of the indebtedness alleged in\n3\nthe SOR is due to the business failure when Applicant personally guaranteed\nrepayment of business debts, which the new owner had agreed to pay when he took\nover the business.  \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $130 to $8,536,\nfor a total of approximately $21,000. In his answer, Applicant admitted all the debts\nexcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d.

To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n7\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n8\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n9\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n10\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n17\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n18\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n19\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n20\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(d). \n22\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n23\n6\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n19\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties dating back several years. His history of financial difficulties raises concerns\nbecause it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not\n20\nmeeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more\n21\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions, and they suggest some\nfinancial irresponsibility as well. In addition, Applicant had an NSF check in 2005 via a\nbusiness dispute with a vendor, which raises the disqualifying condition concerning\ndeceptive or illegal financial practices.  \n22\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns:  \n23\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n24\n7\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and three are most\npertinent here. First, \u00b6 20(a) applies because the indebtedness (to include the NSF\ncheck) occurred under the unique circumstances of Applicant\u2019s business operations\nduring 2005\u20132006, and the business is now closed. Accordingly, these circumstances\nare unlikely to happen again. \nSecond, \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant\u2019s business sale and then failure were\ncircumstances largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances by taking back the business, liquidating its assets, closing the business,\nand addressing the indebtedness. \nThird, \u00b6 20(d) applies because Applicant has made substantial progress in\nresolving the nine debts alleged in the SOR. He paid or settled five debts, two debts are\nin repayment plans, the collection lawsuit for one debt should be dismissed soon, and\none debt is a duplicate. Given these circumstances, I conclude Applicant initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nTogether with his wife, Applicant has sufficient household gross income (nearly\n$90,000) and a positive cash flow to resolve the two debts in repayment plans in short\norder. In other words, Applicant is not now overextended. Looking forward, based on his\ntrack record of repayment and his available income, it is most likely that Applicant will\nresolve the outstanding delinquent debts in the near future and that additional financial\nproblems will not recur. \nTo conclude, based on the record as a whole, I have no doubts or reservations\nabout Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I gave\ndue consideration to the nine-factor whole-person concept.  Applicant met his ultimate\n24\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.       \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, his testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 41 years old, married and has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Security Officer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits to 7 of the 13 delinquent debts set forth in the SOR under this guideline. Namely, that he is indebted in the amount of approximately $300,000.00. Credit Reports of the Applicant dated August 13, 2008; January 30, 2009; June 19, 2009; and July 28, 2009; collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR. (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5). The Applicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2007.

(Government Exhibit 1).  On April 24, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended); and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 4, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another Administrative\nJudge on July 1, 2009.  It was transferred to the undersigned Administrative Judge on\nJuly 7, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 8, 2009, scheduling the hearing for\nJuly 28, 2009.  The Government offered five exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 5 which were received without objection. Applicant offered no\n\n2\nexhibits.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until\nclose of business on August 17, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted a total of nine Post-Hearing Exhibits\nin no particular order.  Six of the exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post- Hearing\nExhibits: Index, A, C, D, H and J, correspond with the lettered allegations set forth in the\nSOR.  Three other exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits L, M and N\ndo not correspond with the allegations in the SOR.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\nwas received on August 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nhis testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 41 years old, married and has a high\nschool diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Security Officer and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to 7 of the 13 delinquent debts set forth in the SOR under\nthis guideline.  Namely, that he is indebted in the amount of approximately $300,000.00.\nCredit Reports of the Applicant dated August 13, 2008; January 30, 2009; June 19,\n2009; and July 28, 2009; collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the\nSOR.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5).  The Applicant has been working for\nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since 2007.\nThe Applicant explained that a series of unexpected circumstances caused or\ncontributed to his delinquent debts.  In 2000, he obtained a fixed mortgage.  He and his\nwife refinanced several times and were eventually given an adjusted rate mortgage in\n2007.  After six months, their house payments ballooned and they could no longer\nafford them.  In 2008, his wife suffered a stroke and was out of work for about a month\nand a half.  Her work hours were later reduced, and she was eventually laid off in\nJanuary 2009.  Following his wife\u2019s stroke, the Applicant left a more lucrative job out of\nstate, for a lower paying one in state.  The purpose of this change was to allow him to\nbe closer to his wife to help her with her medical condition, which includes diabetes and\nhigh blood pressure.  The Applicant has no medical insurance and must pay for his\nwife\u2019s medication out of pocket.  His minor daughter also suffers from a minor case of\n\n3\ncerebral palsy.  Applicant\u2019s wife is currently receiving unemployment benefits in the\napproximate amount of $800.00 a month, and is attending college to finish her degree.\nApplicant is currently netting approximately $2,500.00 monthly.  Given their\ncircumstances, they incurred debt that the Applicant was not able to pay.  Recently, he\nhas been working hard to resolve his indebtedness.\n    \nA judgment owed to a creditor in the amount of $16,253.00 was outstanding.\n(Allegation 1(a).)  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, reflects that this debt has been\npaid in full.  \nA debt to a creditor in the amount of $110.00 was outstanding.  (Allegation 1(c).)\nApplicant paid off the debt on July 29, 2009.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit C).  \nApplicant testified that he had made payment arrangements concerning a debt\nowed to a creditor in the amount of $525.00.  (Allegation 1(d).)  Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit D, indicates that the debt was settled and paid off in full on July 29,\n2009.  \nApplicant set up payment arrangements of $100.00 a month for 12 months to pay\na creditor concerning a debt owed in the amount of $496.00.  (Allegation 1(f).)\nApplicant realizes the debt will be paid in full before then.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit Index).         \n                                                       \nA debt to a creditor in the amount of $877.00 was outstanding.  (Allegation 1(h).)\nApplicant contends that he will pay the debt in full by August 22, 2009.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit H).  \nA debt to a creditor in the amount of $515.00 was outstanding.  (Allegation 1(i).)\nApplicant paid the debt off in full on August 13, 2009.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit Index).    \nA debt to a creditor in the amount of $114.00 was outstanding.  (Allegation 1(k).)\nApplicant paid the debt off in full on August 13, 2009.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit Index). \nApplicant\u2019s debt to a mortgage company in the amount of $247,000.00 remains\noutstanding.  (Allegation 1(j).)  Applicant is currently in the process of loan modification.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit J).  \nThe following debts remain owing and outstanding.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit Index indicates that he is making a good faith effort to take care of them.  A debt\nto a creditor in the amount of $15,475.00 for a motor home that was repossessed\nremains outstanding.  (Allegation 1(g)).  Applicant did not understand that he was still\nresponsible to the creditor for a deficiency on the account despite the fact that he\nallowed a voluntary repossession.  Also, a judgment owed to a creditor in the amount of\n$10,814.00 remains outstanding.   (Allegation 1(b)). A debt to a creditor in the amount of\n\n4\n$232.00 remains outstanding.  (Allegation 1(l)).  A debt to a creditor in the amount of\n$2,180.00 remains outstanding.  (Allegation 1(m)).\nApplicant has incurred no new debt since starting his current employment.  He is\ncurrent with all of his regular monthly expenses.\nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager dated June 1, 2006,\nindicates that the Applicant is one of the their finest employees.  He is considered\nhonest, prompt, and hard working and extremely skillful in completing his job\nresponsibilities as well as in accomplishing the overall success of the operation.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit L).\nApplicant received three Army Achievement Medals and various other awards for\nhis successful career in the military.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit M).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n\n5\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress, and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n6\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control\ncontributed to his financial indebtedness.  His wife\u2019s stroke in 2007, and related\ncomplications, her job lay-off in 2009, his income reduction and change of job in 2007,\nand a bad mortgage situation, together created a financial situation that was simply\nunmanageable.  Since changing jobs, his wife\u2019s health has improved and the Applicant\nhas been able to focus on resolving his delinquent debts.  He has contacted his\ncreditors and either paid off the debt or set up payment plans that he is following to\nresolve them over time.  He plans to pay all of his debts and is working hard to do so.\nThe Applicant has demonstrated that he is responsible and that he has made a good\nfaith effort to resolve his debts.  He understands that he must live within his means and\nbe fiscally responsible at all times.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has\nintroduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to\novercome the Government's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Condition 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\n\n7\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20.(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for\nthe Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant\u2019s circumstances\nhave changed.  He has been able to pay off some of his delinquent debts and is\ncontinuing to pay off his others.   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, his\nfavourable character references and the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, candor, and a willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard\nclassified information.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never been married and has no children. Both of his parents passed away by the time he was eight- years old. He was raised by his grandparents. He is a college graduate, with a degree in industrial technology. (GE 1; Tr. 39-42.) Applicant has had a tumultuous past, involving an addiction to drugs and alcohol in the late 1980\u2019s. In 1999, he was incarcerated for 51 days in county jail after he was convicted for shoplifting. During the same time frame, he became involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and he has been sober since May 17, 1999.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 7, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 27, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on September 24, 2010. The Government offered Exhibit (GE) 1 through 8, \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered Exhibit (AE) A through F, \nwhich were admitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. The record was \nheld open for Applicant to submit additional information until close of business \nNovember 5, 2010. Applicant submitted AE G through AE M, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 1, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nAt the hearing on September 24, 2010, Department Counsel made a motion to \namend the SOR, in order to conform to the evidence, by adding \u00b6\u00b61.b., through 1.d., \npursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17. These allegations were part of the SOR dated April 30, \n2010, however neither the administrative judge\u2019s file nor the department counsel\u2019s file \ncontained a complete copy of the original SOR. Applicant had no objections to the \namendment and previously admitted these allegations in his Answer. In an abundance \nof caution, the motion to amend was granted. (Tr. 33-34.) The allegations are as \nfollows: \n \n1.b. You are indebted to Elitrecserv for an account that has been placed \nfor collection by HSBC in the approximate amount of $2,012.00. As of the \ndate of this Statement of Reasons, it remains unpaid. \n \n1.c. You are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service for a tax lien \nentered against you in June 2004 in the approximate amount of \n$7,745.00. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, it remains unpaid. \n \n1.d. You are indebted to a creditor identified as medical account #563255 \non your credit report dated May 08, 2008 in the approximate amount of \n$101.00. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, it remains unpaid. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admits all of the SOR allegations. After a through and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never been \nmarried and has no children. Both of his parents passed away by the time he was eight-\nyears old. He was raised by his grandparents. He is a college graduate, with a degree in \nindustrial technology. (GE 1; Tr. 39-42.) \n \n \nApplicant has had a tumultuous past, involving an addiction to drugs and alcohol \nin the late 1980\u2019s. In 1999, he was incarcerated for 51 days in county jail after he was \nconvicted for shoplifting. During the same time frame, he became involved in Alcoholics \nAnonymous and he has been sober since May 17, 1999. He received recovery \nassistance through a residential recovery house, which he volunteers with currently. He \nserves on the board of directors for the recovery house, and from 2004-2007, he was \nthe President of the board. He is also a Mason Shiner. (GE 1; Tr. 42-52.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of failing to satisfy his Federal tax obligations in a \ntimely manner. A statement from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shows a tax lien, \nfiled in February 1997, against Applicant for tax years 1986, 1989-1991, and 1994. It \nwas released in June 2008. As alleged in SOR allegation 1.a., Applicant is indebted to \nthe IRS for a tax lien entered against him in February 2009, in the approximate amount \nof $14,306. Further, as alleged in SOR allegation 1.c., an IRS tax lien was filed against \nthe Applicant in June 2004 and released in August 2007. Applicant did not pay that \ndebt. He believes that the $7,745 debt on the 2004 released tax lien was added to the \npresent lien, totaling $14,306. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 8; AE A; Tr. \n36-39, 54-74, 79-80, 84.) \n \n \nApplicant has been in communication with the IRS over his tax debt. In 2003, he \nattempted to resolve his delinquent tax obligations through an offer in compromise. It \nwas rejected. There is no evidence that from 2003 to 2007, he took any further actions \non his tax debt. In 2007, he again sought an offer in compromise. He was informed that \nhis tax account was in an \u201cuncollectible status\u201d and would be \u201creleased by 2014.\u201d \nTherefore, he made no payments on his debt. On October 1, 2010, five months after \nreceiving the SOR, he sent the IRS a new offer in compromise, proposing to pay the \nIRS $300 per month. The IRS responded on October 25, 2010, requesting Applicant \ncomplete additional documentation. On October 26, 2010, he sent in the necessary \npaperwork to process his proposed offer in compromise. Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentation establishing if the offer in compromise had been accepted by the IRS by \nclose of the record. He attributes his tax debt to \u201cunderstating his taxes\u201d on his income \ntax returns. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 8; AE A; AE G; AE H; AE I; AE J; \nAE K; AE L; AE M; Tr. 36-39, 54-74, 79-80, 84.) \n \n \nApplicant was also indebted to a collection service for a credit card in the \napproximate amount of $2,012, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b. Applicant incurred \nthis debt in approximately 2003 when he was laid off for a period of approximately nine \nmonths. On August 3, 2009, Applicant settled this account with the creditor for a \npayment of $700. He introduced a letter from the creditor that advised the account was \nnow settled. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 81-82.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.d. alleged that Applicant was indebted on a medical account in the \napproximate amount of $101. This debt was incurred when Applicant bounced a check \nto a hospital. Applicant presented documentation from the hospital that in February \n2008, he satisfied this account in full. (GE 2; AE C; Tr. 82.) \n \n \nApplicant has no additional past due delinquent accounts. He currently has \nsavings of approximately $3,500 and total assets of $57,855. He has a net remainder of \n$111 after his monthly bills are paid. His monthly remainder does not take into account \nhis proposed payment of $300 per month to the IRS. (GE 8; AE H; Tr. 87-88.) \n \n \nApplicant presented a letter from his friend and accountant that indicated \nApplicant was an \u201cupstanding individual.\u201d He has been recognized for his \u201ccommitment \nand hard work\u201d by his employer. (AE A; AE E; AE F.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations with respect to the \nIRS. He has had a number of tax liens filed against him and currently owes the IRS \n$14,306. From his personal financial statement, it does not appear that he has the \nmeans to satisfy his debt, with a remainder of only $111 per month. The Government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve \nhis delinquent Federal tax debt. After his 2003 attempt to resolve the debt through an \noffer in compromise, he ignored the debt until 2007. In 2007, instead of paying his \nobligation, he chose to rely on the statute of limitations that would eventually apply. His \ndebts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under Appeal Board precedent.1 He did not \nresolve his delinquent tax debts through payment, establish payment plans, or dispute \nthe debt. Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s debt alleged in 1.b. resulted from his layoff in 2003. He was laid off \nfor a nine month period and unable to make his credit card payments. However, he did \nnot produce documentation showing his delinquent tax debts were affected by this \nperiod of unemployment. There is no evidence to suggest that his tax lien resulted in \nany circumstances beyond his control. Further, his inaction on his tax debt does not \nshow he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially \nmitigating. \n \n \nApplicant did not present any evidence of financial counseling. Further, his \nfinancial problems are not resolved or under control, despite having satisfied SOR \nallegations 1.b and 1.d. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has made a good faith effort to satisfy the creditors in SOR allegations \n1.b. and 1.d. However, the same cannot be said with respect to his Federal tax debt. He \ndid not adequately demonstrate his efforts to pay the tax debt when his first offer in \ncompromise was rejected. Instead, he relied on the fact that the debt would eventually \nexpire. The Appeal Board has long held that reliance on the statute of limitations as a \ndefense is not normally a substitute for good-faith efforts to pay off a debt.2 While he is \ncurrently attempting to negotiate an offer in compromise with the IRS, it does not appear \nthat Applicant has the funds available to satisfy his proposed agreement, should the IRS \naccept the proposal. AG \u00b6 20(d) only applies in part. \n \n \nApplicant does not dispute the legitimacy of his debt to the IRS. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. \n \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008), citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. \n16, 2002). \n2 ISCR Case No. 07-16427 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 7, 2010). \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has had numerous challenges in life that he has persevered through. \nHe is well respected by his friend and has made significant contributions to our society \nthrough his community service. However, he has failed to show that he is responsible \nwith respect to his financial obligations. His federal tax debt is large and he does not \nhave the funds to satisfy his debt. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She \npurchased a second home without first selling her home. She has been unable to sell \neither of the homes. Applicant owes approximately $650,000 on her second home.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n \n1 \nAugust 25, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 7, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn May 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On May \n27, 2009, I was assigned the case. On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing held on June 23, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits A through J, which were admitted into evidence.

Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, including pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior systems engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since May 2007. She is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nApplicant was in the United States Air Force for 14 years, having enlisted in 1978. (Tr. \n21) She was enlisted before becoming an officer. (Tr. 83) She was a captain (O-3) when \nshe retired due to a service drawdown of officers. (Tr. 21) She receives an annual \nretirement of approximately $11,000. (Ex. 2, page 148)  \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was living in an apartment when she met and later \nmarried her partner. (Tr. 21, 51, 54) They purchased a home (House A) on an interest-\nonly loan for $476,000, with a monthly mortgage payment of approximately $3,100. (Tr. \n55, Ex. I) Her partner was a real estate agent working for the company that sold them \ntheir home. She had been employed by that company since 2005. (Tr. 55) In December \n2006, after having lived in their home for two and a half to three years, they learned of a \nlarger home being sold by the same company that sold them their current home. \n \nIn June or July 2006, they purchased the larger home (House B) and closed on it \nin January 2007. (Tr. 23) The selling company told them the company would assist \nthem in selling their home. (Tr. 24) Applicant\u2019s partner was still working for the \ncompany. Once the contract was signed, the company failed to remember the \nagreement and has taken no action to help Applicant sell her home. (Tr. 25)  \n \nThe home was appraised at $850,000. (Tr. 45, Ex. 1) The principal mortgage of \n$650,000, which represented about 80% of the purchase price, required monthly \ninterest only payments of $4,642. (Ex. 2, page 220) Applicant had a second mortgage of \n$200,000, representing approximately 20% of the purchase price, which required \n$2,134 monthly interest only payments for 30 years and then a balloon payment. The \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 \n\nballoon payment of $175,000 was due in February 2022. (Ex. 2, page 221) Initially, \nApplicant was able to pay both mortgages and the new home and her mortgage on their \nother home. In March 2008, Applicant made her last monthly mortgage payment on \nHouse B. (Tr. 30, 77) The mortgage on House B is currently more than $81,000 past \ndue.  \n \nApplicant intended to sell House A after buying House B, but was unable to do \nso. In March 2007, House A was put on the market for the amount originally paid for the \nhouse. (Tr. 56) No offers were received on House A and in June 2007, it was taken off \nthe market. (Tr. 27) Applicant changed realtors and still no offers were received. In April \n2007, after having lived in the bigger house for 90 days, Applicant listed House B for \nsale and moved back into her original home (House A). (Tr. 26, 28)  \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant began negotiations with her mortgage company to \nlist House B as a short sale.2 Applicant received a dozen offers on House B, but the \nmortgage company was slow in processing or negotiating on the offers. (Tr. 30, 31) As \nof September 2008, only one offer remained, which the mortgage lender did not accept. \nIn October 2008, Applicant paid $15,000 she obtained from her income tax refund to be \nreleased from her second mortgage of $ 200,986. (Tr. 58, Ex. 2, page 155) With this \npayment, her account was \u201cpaid in full.\u201d (Ex. 2, page 154) \n \nThe creditor informed Applicant the short-sale was not accepted because the \nmarket value of the home was $30,000 less than the creditor\u2019s minimum appraisal rate. \n(Tr. 33) In October 2008, Applicant elected to proceed with a Deed in Lieu of \nForeclosure.3 In December 2008, she was asked to commit to, but not to pay at that \ntime, $15,000. She made the commitment. (Tr. 79) She has set aside the funds so they \nare available should the mortgage lender accept the Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure.  \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant received an offer of $560,000 on House B, which was \n$84,950 less than the $659,000 owed by Applicant. (Tr. 63) The Deed in Lieu of \nForeclosure was stopped and a short-sale agreement considered. (Tr. 34, 60) The \npurchasers were to be provided written evidence of the creditor\u2019s approval by June 5, \n2009. (Tr. 59) Approval has not been received.  \n \nIn January 2009, the mortgage lender ordered a title search of the property. The \ncompany that sold the house put three liens on the property for $1 million, $3 million, \nand $4 million dollars. It took Applicant 90 days to have the liens removed and title \n                                                          \n2 A short sale is a sale of real estate in which the proceeds from the sale fall short of the balance owed on \na loan secured by the property sold. The mortgage lender agrees to allow the home owner to sell the \nmortgaged property for less than the outstanding balance of the loan. The lender has the right to approve \nor disapprove any proposed sale. A short sale typically is executed to prevent a home foreclosure and is \nbased on the most economic way for the mortgage lender to recover the maximum possible amount owed \non the property. A short sale is typically faster and less expensive than a foreclosure. It does not \nextinguish the remaining balance unless clearly indicated on the mortgage lender\u2019s acceptance offer. \n3 A creditor can not be forced to accept a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure. (Tr. 47) \n \n3 \n\ncleared. (Tr. 37, Ex. D) Two other liens on the property were also released. (Tr. 37, 38, \nEx. E and F) \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant and her partner separated and her partner moved to \nthe opposite coast. They are not divorced. (Tr. 51) Before she left, her partner\u2019s annual \nincome was $30,000. (Tr. 43) Applicant\u2019s and her partner\u2019s names were on both \nhouses. Applicant has refinanced the mortgage on House A with the same creditor who \nholds the first mortgage on House B. (Tr. 78) Her partner provided a quit claim deed on \nthe homes. (Tr. 42) Applicant has received no payment from her partner on either \nhome. (Tr. 44)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income from her job with a defense contractor is \napproximately $10,000. (Ex. 2) If Applicant was making payments on both mortgages, \nher monthly net disposable income (gross income less deductions and monthly \nexpenses) would be a negative $2,769. (Ex. I) If she were no longer liable for the \n$5,000 monthly mortgage payments on House B, her net monthly disposable income \nwould be $2,358. (Ex. I) She has $15,000 in stocks. She has sufficient funds to pay her \nmortgage lender should a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure be accepted. Except for failure to \npay her mortgages, Applicant has not been late on any other payments. (Tr. 53)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n4 \n\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \n5 \n\n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant is approximately $81,000 behind on her mortgage payments having \nmade her last payment in March 2008. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant made a serious mistake in her real estate purchases. She purchased a \nsecond home before selling her first home. She did so, in part, relying on assurances \nfrom the selling company that they would help her sell her first home, which she had \nalso purchased from them. Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by market \nfactors beyond her control. Home prices greatly declined following a period of homes \nbeing over-valued.  \n \n \nApplicant has done what she can to eliminate this obligation. She knew she could \nnot financially pay for the home without selling her original home. Market factors \nprevented the sale of that home. Until March 2008, Applicant was able to make the \napproximate $10,000 monthly mortgage payments on the two homes; the $3,100 \ninterest only payment on the first home, the $4,642 interest only payments on the \n$650,000 mortgage, and $2,134 interest only payments on the second mortgage on the \nsecond home. Escrow fees, including property tax and insurance, would have increased \n \n6 \n\nthese monthly amounts. Applicant was fortunate to be able to settle the $200,000 \nsecond mortgage for $15,000.  \n \n \nWhen she realized the real estate company would not help her sell her original \nhome, she moved out of the second home and put it on the market for sale. She also \nhad the first home on the market. In the few months she owned the second home, the \nmarket had changed. Homes had been over-valued when appraised. Her second home \nwas appraised at $850,000 and she has been unable to secure an offer on it at \n$660,000. Additionally, Applicant and her partner separated and her partner moved out-\nof-state and provided no financial support.  \n \nThe decline in the value of the real estate is not, of itself, the sole cause of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. The decline in valued has prevented Applicant from \nliquidating the debt through sale of the properties at the amounts owed. However, it was \nthe inability to sell her first home that that resulted in her inability to make her mortgage \npayments. Both are factors factor beyond her control. \n \nApplicant made payments on both homes until March 2008. She actively pursued \nalternatives with the mortgage holder including the possibility of a short sale and a deed \nin lieu of foreclosure. She obtained offers on the second home, but each fell through \ndue in part to her mortgage company taking too long to evaluate the offers and their \nunwillingness to accept reasonable offers based on decreased property values. In May \n2009, Applicant obtained an offer of $560,000 on the second home, which was \napproximately $85,000 less than the $659,000 owed. Her mortgage company has yet to \nact on the offer.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. Although the behavior is infrequent, one debt \nremains unpaid. There are no other delinquent obligations. Her unpaid mortgage \npayments are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). The debt was incurred under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur. The downturn in the housing market does not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nAG & 20(b) fully applies. The downturn of the market, the inability to sell either \nhome, and the separation from her partner are actions beyond her control. Applicant did \nall she could to eliminate the debt. She obtained offers and forwarded them to her \nmortgage lender for action. She acted responsibly under the circumstances. She has \nheld back $15,000 in funds should her mortgage lender accept a Deed in Lieu of \nForeclosure or some other offer of settlement as was made by the holder of the second \nmortgage.  \n \nAG & 20(c) partially applies. There has been no showing Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling. However, except for this single debt, Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control. If the second mortgage is eliminated, which is approximately $5,100 per \n \n7 \n\nmonth, Applicant\u2019s monthly net income (gross income less deductions and expenses) \ngoes from a negative $2,769 to a positive $2,358. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The debt incurred was not the type that \nindicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Money was not spent frivolously. Applicant has only one outstanding debt. \nThis debt cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not \nsimply whether all her debts are paid\u2014it is whether her financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) I have \nconsidered the unique circumstances surrounding the purchase of the second home. \nApplicant\u2019s reasoning in purchasing the larger home had merit at the time. Homes were \nincreasing in value. She anticipated house prices would continue to increase or at least \nno decrease. The downturn in the housing market caught a large segment of the \npopulation by surprise.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted \nthat the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an \napplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid \noff each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \n \n8 \n\n \n9 \napplicant demonstrate that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the \npayment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement \nthat the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan \nbe the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nHaving had a bad experience in purchasing a home without first selling the prior \nhome, it is unlikely Applicant will repeat the conduct. Applicant was unable to make her \nmonthly mortgage payments on two houses, but this does not indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. It does not raise \nquestions about her reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 25, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 20, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M.\nCrean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge ignored record evidence\nfavorable to Applicant; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts for medical expenses, credit\ncards, telephone services, etc.  The total amount of the debt was $33,434.  Although Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems originated in an economic downturn that was outside his control, the Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible behavior in regard to his finances, nor\nhad he established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment.  \u201cHe has not presented a concrete\nsystematic plan for resolving his debt problems.  He has no payment plans in place, and no methods\nof saving to pay debts.  He has sufficient monthly income to not only meet his present obligations,\nbut to make some payments on delinquent debts.\u201d  Decision at 8.  Accordingly, the Judge concluded\nthat Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, for example the exact total amount\nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts.  However, under the facts of this case, the difference in amounts is\nwithout security significance.  Therefore, if the Judge committed error, it was harmless.  See ISCR\nCase No. 01-23362 (App. Bd.

Although Applicant contends that the Judge\ndid not consider his testimony concerning his monthly expenses, his presentation on appeal is not\nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge has considered all the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 23, 2008).  Finally, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complied with the\nrequirements of Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct\nin reaching his decision.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old and has worked as an engineering technician for a defense contractor for approximately two years. He is married with one child. He also has approximately two years of college credits (Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated August 21 2008). Applicant and his wife worked in the entertainment and service industry in Nevada prior to September 11, 2001. Applicant's parents and in-laws also lived and worked in the same area. Applicant and his wife had at the time a combined income of over $80,000 a year. Their income consisted of a set salary and tips. After September 11, 2001, the travel and entertainment industry declined and Applicant and his wife lost income. Their income initially dropped from $80,000 yearly to about $40,000 yearly because they worked less and did not receive as much in tips. Gradually over five or six months, the entertainment industry started to rebound, and their income rose to about $70,000 yearly (Tr. 73-79). Shortly after September 2001, Applicant's mother became ill and Applicant had to take time from work to assist her. He also took time off to assist with an extensive renovation of his parent's home to accommodate his mother's illness. His income was diminished because he worked less hours. In February 2002, Applicant's father passed away and he took further time off to assist his mother and settle his fathe",

Based on a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and has worked as an engineering technician for a \ndefense contractor for approximately two years. He is married with one child. He also \nhas approximately two years of college credits (Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated August 21 \n2008).  \n \nApplicant and his wife worked in the entertainment and service industry in \nNevada prior to September 11, 2001. Applicant's parents and in-laws also lived and \nworked in the same area. Applicant and his wife had at the time a combined income of \nover $80,000 a year. Their income consisted of a set salary and tips. After September \n11, 2001, the travel and entertainment industry declined and Applicant and his wife lost \nincome. Their income initially dropped from $80,000 yearly to about $40,000 yearly \nbecause they worked less and did not receive as much in tips. Gradually over five or six \nmonths, the entertainment industry started to rebound, and their income rose to about \n$70,000 yearly (Tr. 73-79).  \n \nShortly after September 2001, Applicant's mother became ill and Applicant had to \ntake time from work to assist her. He also took time off to assist with an extensive \nrenovation of his parent's home to accommodate his mother's illness. His income was \ndiminished because he worked less hours. In February 2002, Applicant's father passed \naway and he took further time off to assist his mother and settle his father's affairs. In \naddition, his wife became pregnant so she did not work as many hours and also \nreceived less in tips. Their son was born in October 2002, and his wife initially stayed \nhome to care for the infant. She returned to work after four months, but Applicant took \nan absence from his job to care for his son. The lost of income of both Applicant and his \nwife affected their ability to pay the family's debts. Applicant and his wife filed for a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2003, mainly to protect their interest in their house. They \nwere unable to maintain payments required by the Chapter 13 bankruptcy so the \nbankruptcy action was dismissed in July 2004. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant's mother decided to return to where she was raised on the \neast coast. Applicant and his wife decided to also move to be near his mother on the \neast coast. Applicant and his wife sold their home in Nevada and realized a profit of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nover $40,000. Some of the profit was used to pay some small debts and moving \nexpenses. Applicant did not apply any of the profits to pay outstanding debts listed in \nthe 2003 bankruptcy petition (Tr. 78-79). \n \nAfter moving to the east coast, Applicant was initially unable to find employment. \nAfter about four months, he found part-time employment as a bartender. He worked for \nabout ten months as a car salesman, and then for two years as an account executive in \nthe telecommunication industry. He started working for the defense contractor in \nSeptember 2007. In addition, Applicant had shoulder surgery in 2006. He was out of \nwork for some time and incurred medical debts from co-pays and procedures not \ncovered by his health insurance. \n \nCredit reports and Applicant's admissions reveal financial issues and delinquent \ndebts for Applicant: a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 2003 (SOR 1.a); a medical \ndebt in collection for $711 (SOR 1.b); a direct television account in collection for $193 \n(SOR 1.c); a telephone account in collection for $345 (SOR 1.d); a hospital medical \naccount from his shoulder surgery in collection for $2,768 (SOR 1.e); a department \nstore credit card charged off for $471 (SOR 1.f); a discount store debt in collection for \n$647 (SOR 1.g); a bank credit card debt in collection for $658 (SOR 1.h); a credit card \ndebt in collection for $945 (SOR 1.i); a bank credit card debt charged off for $4,676 \n(SOR 1.j); a credit card debt in collection for $9,445 (SOR 1.k); a bank credit card debt \nin collection for $7,572 (SOR 1.l); a credit card account in collection for $5,380 (SOR \n1.m); a credit card account in collection for $3,845 (SOR 1.n); a credit card account in \ncollection for $4,160 (SOR 1.o); a medical debt in collection for $75 (SOR 1.p); and \nanother medical account in collection for $43 (SOR 1.q; Answer to SOR, dated July 15, \n2009; Gov. Ex. 7, Answers to Interrogatories, dated March 23, 2009; Gov. Ex. 8, Credit \nreport, dated September 9, 2008; Gov. Ex. 9, Credit report, dated March 20, 2009). The \ndelinquent debt totals $33,434. \n \nSOR allegation 1.a is the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 2003. Since \nApplicant could not maintain the required payments, the bankruptcy was dismissed in \nJuly 2004 (Tr. 35-36; Gov. Ex. 2, Bankruptcy petition, dated July 3, 2003; Gov. Ex. 3, \nNotice of Default, dated June 3, 2004; Gov. Ex. 4, Dismissal order, dated July 29, 2004; \nGov. Ex. 6, Bankruptcy Docket, dated July 29, 2004).  \n \nSOR allegation 1.b is a medical debt from Applicant's 2006 shoulder surgery. He \ndid not pay the debt at the time of the surgery and it was sent for collection. He has not \nmade any payments or arrangements to pay the debt (Tr. 54-55). \n \nSOR allegation 1.c is for a direct television account incurred after Applicant \nmoved to the east coast. SOR allegation 1.d is for either a telephone account or a credit \ncard from a telephone company. Applicant is not sure of the origin of the debt but \nacknowledges he does owe the debt. He was unable to pay these two debts because of \npayments on other debts and his wife's inability to work full-time. He never contacted \nthe creditors, made payment plans, or made any payments on the debt (Tr. 55-58). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.e is a hospital debt relating to his 2006 shoulder surgery. \nApplicant has not made arrangements to pay the debt and it remains unpaid (Tr. 58-59). \n \nSOR allegation 1.f is for a store credit card from 2006. Applicant believes the \noriginal debt was less than $200 but it now is more because of interest and fees. SOR \nallegation 1.g is a debt to a discount store incurred in 2006 and now in collection. SOR \nallegation 1.h is a credit card debt from 2006 in collection. Applicant has not contacted \nthe creditors, made any payments, or made any payment arrangements with creditors \non these accounts (Tr. 59-61). \n \nSOR allegations 1.i and 1.k are for a credit card debt to the same creditor for the \nsame amount of debt on a card opened on the same day in June 2005. I find that these \ntwo allegations are the same debt in spite of the fact that they have different account \nnumbers. Applicant has not contacted the creditor, or made any payment or payment \narrangements on the debt (Tr. 60-66, 80-81).  \n \nSOR allegation SOR 1.j is for a line of credit opened in May 2001 prior to the July \n2003 bankruptcy filing. SOR allegation 1.l is a debt to an electronics department store \nincurred prior to the bankruptcy filing. SOR allegation 1.m is for a credit card debt \nincurred prior to the 2003 bankruptcy filing. SOR allegation 1.n is another credit card \ndebt incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing. SOR allegation 1.o is the remainder of a debt \nfrom a car repossessed in 2001. These accounts were included in the bankruptcy filing \nbut not paid since the bankruptcy action was dismissed for non-payment of the wage \nearner plan. The debts remain unpaid (Tr. 65-68).  \n \nSOR allegation 1.p is a medical debt in collection. Applicant's health insurance \ncompany was supposed to pay the medical debt. It was not paid, and the account was \nsent for collection. After Applicant's inquiry, his insurance company paid the debt. The \ncollection agency charged Applicant a fee which is listed as SOR allegation 1.p. \nApplicant believes he does not owe this debt since it was not his error that caused the \ndebt to be sent to the collection agency. He has not disputed the debt with the collection \nagency or taken other steps to resolve the debt. However, I find for Applicant since the \ncollection agency charge was not caused by Applicant's action or lack of action (Tr. 68-\n69, 81-82). \n \nSOR allegation 1.q is a medical debt from Applicant's shoulder surgery. Applicant \nhas not paid the debt or made any payment arrangements (Tr. 69-70). \n \nApplicant presented five letters of recommendation. His immediate supervisor \nnoted that Applicant was promoted based on his work ethics, dependability, and \nwillingness to learn and take responsibility. Applicant is a valued member of his staff \n(App. Ex. A, Letter, dated August 20, 2009). Another supervisor noted that Applicant is \na dedicated and motivated employee. Applicant has an outstanding and professional \nattitude. Applicant is his go-to guy for projects (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated September 1, \n2009). The facility security officer for Applicant's employer noted that Applicant showed \ngenuine concern to fix his financial problems and qualify for a security clearance (App. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nEx. C, Letter, dated August 21, 2009). A friend of Applicant's family who has known \nApplicant for over 25 years noted that Applicant has an excellent character. Applicant \nhas always been willing to help him in teach martial arts to children (App. Ex. D, Letter, \ndated September 1, 2009). A patent attorney, who is Applicant's family friend, stated \nthat he has known Applicant for over ten years. He noted that Applicant sacrificed much \nto care for his mother and father. He considers Applicant to be honest and dependable \nand he would trust Applicant explicitly (App. Ex. E, Letter, dated August 28, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). There are 17 allegations \nlisted. One of the allegations involves a 2003 bankruptcy filing. Two of the allegations \n(SOR 1.i and 1.k) are duplicates. The remaining allegations show delinquent debts \ntotaling over $32,500.  \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony concerning the delinquent debts. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. The debts are \nfrom numerous sources and remain unpaid so the behavior of having delinquent debts \nis current. Applicant did not present any information indicating that the circumstances \nleading to delinquent debts were such that it could not recur.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances). This mitigating condition has \nsome application to Applicant's circumstances. Applicant's finances were in order before \nthe business downturn in the entertainment and travel industry resulting from the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntragedy on September 11, 2001. Applicant immediately experienced financial problems \nfrom lost wages and tips. However, he did not establish that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. While he did initially lose income, within a few months his income \nwas back to 80% to 90% of what it was prior to the events of 9/11. He also sold his \nhouse at a considerable profit but used only a small amount to pay off some previous \ndebts. He has been gainfully employed since moving to the east coast in 2004, but he \nhas not made any payments on his debts. He has not even made contact with creditors \nto establish payment plans. Applicant states that he does not have sufficient income to \npay his debts. However, some are small and some action can be taken to start to make \npayments. He has not demonstrated that under these circumstances he acted \nresponsibly towards his finances.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant \nhas not made payments on any of his debts whether incurred prior to filing bankruptcy \nin 2003 or recently after moving to the east coast. He does not have payment plans \nestablished for the payment of his delinquent debts. He does not have a systematic \nconcrete method of managing his delinquent finances. He has not shown a reasonable, \nprudent, honest course of action to manage his debts. Accordingly, he has not \nestablished a good faith effort to resolve his debt. Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns based on his finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's good \nreputation, as noted by letters of recommendation, at work and in the community for \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, and reliability.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that \nis required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his actions to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment. He has \nnot presented a concrete systematic plan for resolving his debt problems. He has no \npayment plans in place, and no methods of saving to pay debts. He has sufficient \nmonthly income to not only meet his present obligations, but to make some payments \non delinquent debts. Applicant's management of his past obligations indicates he may \nnot be concerned, responsible, and careful regarding classified information. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. He has not established he is suitable for a security \nclearance. I conclude Appellant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant (duplicate of 1.i) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l - 1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E on July 10, 2009. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR, and answered it in writing on August 24, 2009. He\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on\nMarch 19, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\n2\nAugust 27, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 14,\n2009, and I received the case assignment on November 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on November 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nDecember 10, 2009. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted 15 exhibits (AE) A through O, which were admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 18, 2009. I\nheld the record open until January 10, 2020, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation. Applicant timely submitted two exhibits, AE P and AE Q, without\nobjection. The record closed on January 10, 2010.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to\n15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 9.) \nPost-hearing Submissions\nThe record closed January 10, 2010. Thereafter, Applicant submitted additional\ndocumentation on two separate occasions. Applicant did not file a motion requesting\nthat the record be reopened. The Government objected to the admission of this\nadditional evidence on the grounds that the submissions are not timely. The\nGovernment has not argued that it would be prejudiced by the submission of Applicant\u2019s\nadditional evidence.\nI have considered the Government\u2019s argument and the failure of Applicant, a\nnon-lawyer, to file a motion. I find that the Government is not prejudiced by the\nadmission of Applicant\u2019s submissions. These documents are admitted as AE R through\nAE U. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and\n1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a,\nand 2.b of the SOR.1\n\nGE 1; Tr. 30-31.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 29-30.\n3\nAE F; AE J; AE K; AE L; AE M; AE N; AE O; Tr. 33-34, 47-48.\n4\nAE E; Tr. 42-43.\n5\n3\nApplicant, who is 50 years old, was hired by a Department of Defense contractor\nin 2008 to work as a law enforcement professional with the troops in Iraq. He deployed\nto Iraq to work on the improvised explosive device (IED) problems. At the end of his one\nyear tour of duty, he learned that his security clearance was rescinded. As of the date of\nthe hearing, Applicant was not working.  \n2\nApplicant graduated from college in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He\njoined a major city police department in July 1985. He worked in narcotics and gang\nunits during his 16 years as a police officer. He retired in September 2001 on disability.\nApplicant married in 2005 and has a daughter, who is 35 months old.3\nApplicant purchased two properties in 1988 or 1989 (AE F - house B and house\nC). In 2002, he purchased a property, where he lived, for $700,000 (AE F - house A).\nHe rented the other two properties. Applicant began purchasing fix-up properties around\n2002. After he repaired each property, he sold it for a profit. He retained ownership of\nthese properties for a short period of time. He indicated that he sold each property for\nbetween $20,000 and $50,000. He used the profits to purchase another property and to\npay any bills related to the sold property. Applicant received tax notices on his\ninvestment properties which he either paid in April or December of the year when due.\nHe assumed his business agent also received the tax bills.4\nApplicant purchased a house in the early summer of 2005, which he sold in\nAugust 2005. He owned this property for 63 days. Applicant believed that all expenses\nrelated to this property, including property taxes, were contained in the settlement\ndocuments and paid from the sale proceeds. When he was in Iraq, he learned that he\nowed additional property taxes on this property. He did not receive the notices on the\npast due taxes, as the notices were mailed to the wrong address. When he learned\nabout the unpaid taxes in 2009, he paid them. Although the State tax office issued a\nrelease of lien for its lien filed in January 2006, Applicant stated he did not realize a lien\nhad been filed on this property. He did not own the property when the lien was filed.5\nIn the fall 2005, a real estate agent suggested Applicant purchase a property,\nthen tear down the house and rebuild. Applicant indicated that the destruction and\nrebuilding process took about 18 months, and because of this time period, his financial\nproblems developed. Applicant purchased three homes for investment (House D, house\nE, house F). Applicant purchased these properties by refinancing his two rental\nproperties and his home with a first mortgage. He also obtained a second loan, which\nwas a home equity loan, with the two rental properties as collateral. Before he could\ncomplete the rebuilding of even one of the three houses of his investment properties,\n\nAE F; AE H; AE I; Tr. 33-35.\n6\nGE 2, p. 10; AE G; Tr. 35-39.\n7\nGE 3; AE P; Tr. 62-66.\n8\nAE P; AE R; AE S.\n9\n4\nthe real estate market changed and property values began to decline. Applicant sold the\nthree investment properties between February 2007 and March 2008. He does not owe\nany money on these properties, as the property sold for an amount equal to the debt\nowed the primary mortgagor.6\nBy early 2008 Applicant did not have sufficient income to pay the three\nmortgages and two equity loans on his home and the two unoccupied rental homes\npurchased in 1988 or 1989. He tried to sell these homes, including by short sale, but he\nwas unsuccessful. The mortgage holder foreclosed on all three properties (house A,\nhouse B, house C) and sold all three homes in August 2008. Applicant does not owe the\nprimary lender any money on its loans.7\nAs previously stated, Applicant obtained two equity loans to finance his\ninvestment properties in October 2005. He paid his monthly payment on each loan until\nFebruary 2008. When his properties sold at foreclosure, the sale proceeds covered the\nmortgage loans on these properties, but were insufficient to pay the equity loans.\nApplicant obtained a letter from the loan officer who arranged the four loans, including\nthese two equity lines of credit (junior liens), on Applicant\u2019s rental properties. The loan\nofficer opined that 1) upon a foreclosure sale, the proceeds from the foreclosure sale\nare applied to the first mortgage and if there are any remaining funds after all taxes and\ncosts are paid, the proceeds are applied to junior liens; and 2) all junior liens are either\nsatisfied with the sale proceeds or eliminated at the trustee\u2019s sale. Based on this\nknowledge, the loan officer stated that Applicant\u2019s two properties (house B and house\nC) went to a trustee sale and the liens were extinguished. No documentation showing\nwhat occurred at the trustee sale has been provided.8\nThe company holding the equity line of credit on house B and house C and listed\nas a creditor on the credit reports of record is no longer in business. Applicant traced\nthe loans to a banking institution, which purchased the company owning the lines of\nequity. Applicant spoke with this creditor. The creditor initially agreed to provide a letter\non the status of his accounts, but later withdrew its offer. It also refused to issue a 1099\nfor tax purposes. Instead, the creditor verbally advised Applicant that these two debts\nare charged-off and have a zero balance. The creditor did not provide any information\non what it intends to do about the collection of the charged-off debts, if anything.9\nSubsequent to the hearing, Applicant challenged the validity of the two equity\nlines of credit with the credit reporting companies. As a result, the three credit reporting\ncompanies deleted these two debts from his credit report. The two credit reports of\nrecord do not show a debt owed to the current creditor and purchaser of these two\n\nGE 3, GE 4; AE R; AE T; AE U.\n10\nApplicant used his cash assets to purchase his current house.

Applicant did not submit a full credit report with his post-hearing submissions.\nThus, the record lacks information as to whether the current creditor has listed these\ndebts on his credit report.10\nApplicant moved his family across the country in July 2009. He purchased a\nhouse for $575,000 and has a mortgage of $275,000.  His monthly mortgage payment\n11\nis $3,200. His current monthly income totals $3,700. Applicant has applied for\nunemployment benefits and has some money in his checking account to pay normal\nmonthly living expenses. He does not have a car payment and limits his credit\nexpenses.12\nApplicant received a job offer on April 21, 2008, which he immediately accepted.\nHis new employer acknowledged Applicant\u2019s acceptance of the job offer by e-mail,\ndated April 22, 2008. As a condition of employment, his new employer required him to\ncomplete a security clearance questionnaire (e-QIP) before May 5, 2008. The e-QIP\nwas attached to the e-mail along with instructions. Applicant completed the e-QIP in late\nApril 2008 and submitted it to his facility security officer (FSO) for processing. At this\ntime, he was not 90 days late in his mortgage payments on his three properties nor had\nthe foreclosure process begun on his properties. He discussed this fact with his FSO\nwho advised that since he was not yet 90 days past due, he should answer \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 28 (b): \u201cAre you currently over 90 day delinquent on any debts?\u201d13\nApplicant met with the security clearance investigator on July 21, 2008. He\ndiscussed his housing investment enterprise with the investigator. He told the\ninvestigator that the mortgagor had foreclosed on his three properties in May 2008, and\nthat he had requested the mortgagor to initiate a short-sale of the property. He also\nadvised the investigator that the two debts at issue in this case were more than 90 days\npast due and that he was waiting to hear from the mortgagor about the short sale before\ntaking care of these accounts. Applicant argued at the hearing that he made a good\nfaith effort to reveal his mortgage debt problems at the interview. The summary of the\npersonal interview contains no statement which indicated that the investigator\nconfronted Applicant with negative information about his mortgage debts before he\nacknowledged the problem. Inferences warrant a finding that Applicant disclosed his\ndebt problems to the investigator without confrontation.14\n\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\n\n7\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated two delinquent debts from his real estate\ninvestment enterprise, which are not paid. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. BD. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. BD. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See,\ne.g.,ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2(App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4,2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not raised in this case.\n15\n8\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s current financial\nproblems occurred when the real estate market collapsed in 2007. Until the collapse of\nthe real estate market, he paid his personal and investment bills. He is not involved in\nreal estate investment for profit at this time. This mitigating condition has some\napplicability as he exercised reasonable judgment when he invested in his properties.\nThis mitigating condition has only partial applicability since the question of whether\nApplicant will invest in property for resale in the future is unknown.\nUnder AG & 20(b), security concernt may be mitigating where Athe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted\nabove, Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose when the real estate market collapsed in\n2007. He sold three investment properties, but allowed three other properties to go to\nforeclosure. Even though he had significant debt from his investments, he was able to\npay most of the debt by selling his properties. However, he has two unpaid equity lines\nof credit, totaling $70,000. Although he acted responsibly by selling his property, he has\nnot resolved the two debts at issue in this case. I find this mitigating condition is partially\napplicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling nor has he resolved the\ndelinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. I conclude that these mitigating\nconditions are not applicable.15\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n16\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and (e)\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal,\nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country,\nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that\ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or\nother group;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. Applicant completed his e-QIP a few days before his debts\nbecame 90 days past due, and denied any overdue debts. He also denied having any\nliens placed against his property in the prior seven years for failing to pay taxes or other\ndebts. He signed the E-QIP at the time his debts became 90 days past due. Thus, at the\ntime he executed the e-QIP, he omitted material facts about his debts. This information\nis material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance\nand to his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent to hide\nthis information from the government. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not\nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.16\nWhen he completed his e-QIP in April 2008, Applicant followed the advice of his\nFSO and answered \u201cno\u201d to existence of any debts 90 days past due. Under these\ncircumstances, his answer is technically correct. He voluntarily provided the security\nclearance investigator information about his foreclosed property and past due mortgage\ndebts in July 2008. His actions in July 2008 show that he had no intent to falsify his\nanswer to Question 28b or to hide his debt problems from the government. \nRegarding the property lien filed in January 2006, Applicant credibly testified that\nhe did not know about the lien until he was in Iraq. His testimony is supported by the\nfact that the State tax office mailed the delinquent tax notice to the property address in\nlate 2005 or early 2006, even though its records indicated that Applicant sold the\n\n10\nproperty in August 2005 and by the fact that the State government placed the lien\nagainst the property Applicant had already sold. Overall, I find the evidence of record\nfailed to show that Applicant intentionally falsified his answers to the e-QIP. The\ngovernment has not established intentional falsification.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nworked for a large city police department for 16 years, retiring in 2001 on disability. After\nhe retired, he began purchasing houses in need of repair. He made the necessary\nrepairs and sold the houses a few months later for a profit. In the fall 2005, he followed\nthe advice of a real estate agent and purchased three properties where he would tear\ndown the existing house and rebuild. He purchased his new investment properties by\nrefinancing his personal home and two other long-held properties. Shortly after he\nbegan this investment process, the real estate market declined significantly, impacting\nhis ability to resell his property. He eventually sold the three properties he had\npurchased in 2005. \nApplicant could not sell his personal home or the remaining two rental properties.\nHe defaulted on his mortgages and the mortgagor foreclosed on his properties. These\n\n207 C. A.3d 1018 (1989); 2003 W L 23025437 (2003).\n17\nBank of America National Trust and Savings Association v. Graves, E015010 (2009).\n18\n11\nthree properties sold at foreclosure and his primary mortgage debt on his home was\nsatisfied. The two home equity loans on his investment properties were not paid from\nthe sale proceeds as there were no funds to pay these loans. His loan officer correctly\nindicated that under state law, the foreclosure sale extinguished the junior liens on the\nhouse created by the equity loans.  However, under State law, a sold out junior lien\n17\nholder, such as the equity loan holder in this case, generally has a right to sue Applicant\nfor the unpaid debt.  The original creditor for the two equity loans did not sue Applicant\n18\nand is no longer in business. However, Applicant determined that the debts are held by\nanother mortgage lender with an assigned account number. The lender carries the\ndebts on its books as a charge-off with a zero balance. Applicant provided no\ninformation that he paid these debts. He denied owing the debts based on his\nunderstanding that the foreclosure sale eliminated the debts and the elimination of the\noriginal creditor from his credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s problem is not resolved because he has not provided evidence that\nhe paid these debts; that the current creditor has forgiven the debts; that the current\ncreditor will not pursue legal action to obtain a judgment for the debts; or that he has\notherwise resolved these debts. The fact that the current creditor shows a zero balance\non the debts is not enough to show he does not owe these debts. Applicant\nacknowledged that the two debts are listed on the creditor\u2019s records as a charge-off\nwhich, under security clearance law, is not considered resolution of the debts. While\nApplicant has shown that he timely pays his other bills, he has not provided sufficient\nevidence to show that the equity lines of credit are resolved in his favor, or discharged.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F. The government did not establish its case under Guideline E.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s mother, as of March 2009, is a U.S. citizen. He admitted he has a brother and sister who are citizens of Lebanon residing in Saudi Arabia, he has a sister who is a citizen and resident of Lebanon, and he has another sister who is a citizen of Lebanon residing in the U.S. as a resident alien. Applicant admits he has approximately $300,000 in a bank account in Lebanon, which he inherited from his father. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 57 years old and has worked as a linguist supporting the U.S. Army in Iraq since September 2006. He had an interim secret clearance, which expired March 2009, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance.

The case file is being forwarded to the Director, \nDOHA requesting a default decision and the automatic denial or revocation of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n1 \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on June 30, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nforeign influence. \n  \n \nOn July 13, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nDecember 22, 2009, I was assigned the case. On January 4, 2010, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on January 26, 2010. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant failed to appear. On February 3, 2010, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a of \nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s mother, as of March 2009, is a U.S. citizen. He admitted he has a \nbrother and sister who are citizens of Lebanon residing in Saudi Arabia, he has a sister \nwho is a citizen and resident of Lebanon, and he has another sister who is a citizen of \nLebanon residing in the U.S. as a resident alien. Applicant admits he has approximately \n$300,000 in a bank account in Lebanon, which he inherited from his father.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a \nthorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old and has worked as a linguist supporting the U.S. Army \nin Iraq since September 2006. He had an interim secret clearance, which expired March \n2009, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant has not been in \nLebanon since July 2003, and he currently lives and works in Iraq. Applicant has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in structural engineering from a U.S. university. (Tr.12) Applicant\u2019s \nassets exceed one million dollars. (Tr. 12) \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nOn August 6, 2009, Department Counsel (DC) presented Applicant with the \ngovernment\u2019s proposed exhibits and documents. Applicant responded to the material on \nAugust 21, 2009, he provided information and stated he would not be available to leave \nIraq until mid-January 2010. On August 27, 2009, Applicant was offered the possibility \nof having the hearing conducted by video teleconference (VTC) allowing the Applicant \nto remain in Iraq. (Tr. 10) In September 2009, DC requested Applicant provide the \nJanuary 2010 dates he would be in Texas. This request was renewed on November 10, \n2010. (Tr. 11)  \n \n \nOn December 23, 2009, Applicant was sent an e-mail indicating that Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance hearing would be held in Houston, Texas on January 26, 2010. The \ne-mail indicated his failure to respond and/or appear at the hearing without approval \nwould result in a default decision and the automatic denial or revocation of his security \nclearance. (Tr. 5)  \n \n \n2 \n\n \nApplicant responded stating he would not be returning to the U.S. in January \n2010 and did not know when he would return. He stated his work with the U.S. Army in \nIraq did not require him to have a clearance.  \n \n \nOn December 24, 2009, Applicant was informed that the case would proceed \nunless Applicant\u2019s company withdrew their request for Applicant to have a security \nclearance. He was informed the hearing date would remain unless: one, his company \nformally withdrew its request that Applicant have a security clearance, or, two, an \nalternate time, date, and location were arranged for an in-person hearing or VTC \nhearing. (Tr. 6) Applicant\u2019s company was provided a sealed envelope to be hand \ndelivered and unopened to Applicant. The accompanying material stated that if the \nemployee was no longer employed by the company or if the employee no longer \nrequired a security clearance for access to classified information, the envelope was to \nbe returned unopened. (Tr. 7)  \n \n \nThe company security officer acknowledged to DC that the hearing had been \nscheduled for January 26, 2010. (Tr. 7) DC indicated if Applicant no longer needed a \nclearance, the company should withdraw their request or make the Applicant available \nfor either an in-person or a VTC hearing.  \n \n \nIn a letter dated January 9, 2010, Applicant stated: \n \nI cannot be present in the month of January in Houston for the hearing. I \nam canceling my interview. I do not need my clearance to be reinstated \nanymore. I am still in Iraq, and I have no intention to continue this line of \nwork in the states. Thank you for your services. (Appellate Exhibit I, Tr. 8)  \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to personal conduct. Additionally, it states: \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to \nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperating with \nmedical or psychological evaluation; \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nApplicant was asked when he would be in the U.S. so that a security clearance \nhearing could be scheduled. He was given the option of remaining in Iraq and having \nthe hearing conducted by VTC. He said he could not leave Iraq until mid-January 2010; \ntherefore, the hearing was scheduled for January 26, 2010. Applicant responded and \nstated he no longer needed a clearance. He was informed he needed to be at the \n \n3 \n\n \n4 \nhearing unless his company withdrew its request for him to have a clearance or an \nalternate hearing date was established. Applicant was informed that failing to appear \nwithout approval would result in a default decision and the automatic denial or \nrevocation of his security clearance. Applicant failed to appear.  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nApplicant, without reasonable cause, failed to appear at his scheduled security \nclearance hearing. The file is forwarded to the Director, DOHA for the administrative \ntermination of further processing for clearance eligibility.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline B\nDIGEST: The Directive is subject to general principles of statutory construction.  The\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions are not necessarily most analogous to statutes.  Rather\nthey are examples of circumstances to assist in evaluating aspects of an applicant\u2019s case. \nDisqualifying conditions 7(a) and 7(b) have a significant degree of overlap and one set of\ncircumstances may raise security concerns under both conditions. The Executive Order and the\nlanguage of mitigating condition 8(b) should be interpreted as consistent with one another. The\nlanguage in the first is to ensure that a clearance decision does not create a stigma of disloyalty. \nThe second requires Judge to balance an applicant\u2019s ties within the US to his ties to a foreign\nperson, organization or country in analyzing the extent to which an applicant might find himself\nin a conflict of interest.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEric J. McNeilus, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn April 28, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a senior technical\nplanner working for a Defense contractor.  He was born and raised in Pakistan, where he obtained\na B.S. in electrical engineering.  He moved to the U.S. in the early 1990s and obtained a M.B.A. He\nlived in another country for a few years, returning to the U.S. in the late 1990s.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife was also born, raised, and educated in Pakistan.  She and Applicant became\nU.S. citizens in the late 2000s.  They have two children, both U.S. citizens.  Applicant and his wife\nare citizens of the U.S., Pakistan, and another country.  \nApplicant has numerous relatives who are citizens and/or residents of Pakistan.  His mother\nlives there, and he speaks with her on the telephone approximately once a week.  He also has two\nbrothers living there.  He speaks with one a few times a year and another nearly once a week.\nApplicant also has several sisters who reside in Pakistan and one who lives in the U.S.  Additionally,\nhe has several in-laws who live in Pakistan.  He owns a home in that country, valued at $250,000.\nHe also owns some commercial real estate there valued at about $50,000.  His net worth in the U.S.\nis about $150,000. \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic which supported the U.S. in removing the\nTaliban from power in Afghanistan.  However, terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda operate within\nPakistan, using the country as a safe haven for planning attacks on the U.S., India, and Europe.\nPakistan has a poor human rights record.\nDue Process Violation\n Applicant has raised an issue of due process.  Specifically, he argues that the Judge erred in\nconcluding that two Guideline B disqualifying conditions (DC) both applied to Applicant\u2019s case.\n\nThe Judge also concluded that disqualifying condition 7(e) applied.  This condition reads as follows: \u201ca\n1\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owed or foreign-operated\nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation[.]\u201d  Applicant\u2019s due\nprocess argument does not extend to this provision.  \nApplicant relies on Asiana Airlines v. FAA, 134 F.3d 393, 398 (D.C. Cir. 1998), to the effect that a statute\n2\nshould not be interpreted in such a way as to render its provisions void or superfluous.  See DISCR Case No. 93-1050\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 1994), applying principles of statutory construction to the Directive.     \n3\nHe argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis renders these two conditions duplicative of each other, working\nto the detriment of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.\nThe DCs in question are found at Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).   The security\n1\nconcern addressed by 7(a) is as follows: \n \ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\n7(b), meanwhile, addresses \nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group,\nor country by providing that information.\nApplicant argues that 7(a) covers contact with family members, while (b) addresses broader\nrelationships that may create conflicts of interest.  Citing principles of statutory construction,  he\n2\nargues that \u201cthe only individuals who [Applicant] has connections with in Pakistan are his own\nfamily members.  If paragraph 7(b)\u2013which expressly does not mention family members\u2013applies to\nthis situation, then paragraph 7(a) is rendered superfluous, an untenable result.\u201d  He further contends\nthat, as a consequence, Applicant was burdened in making his case for mitigation.  \u201cIt is entirely\npossible that, if potentially disqualifying condition 7(b) was not considered, [Applicant] may have\nmet his burden of proof on mitigating the Government\u2019s security concerns, at least with respect to\ndisqualifying condition 7(a).\u201d\nWe have considered this argument, in light of the record.  While acknowledging that the\nDirective is subject to general principles of statutory construction, we do not conclude that the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions are themselves most analogous to statutes.  Rather, they are\nexamples both of the kind of circumstances that can give rise to security concerns and of the kind\nthat can mitigate them, to assist DOHA personnel in evaluating troubling aspects of an applicant\u2019s\ncase.  They are not to be considered exhaustive.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 4 (App. Bd. May\n27, 2008).  The Directive makes this explicit by stating that security concerns under the various\n\n\u201c[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\n3\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests\nof the U.S.\u201d\n4\nGuidelines include the stated disqualifying conditions, rather than consist solely of them. See, e.g.,\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 7.    \nAdmittedly, the two disqualifying conditions at issue here are not identical in scope. 7(a)\nfocuses on contacts with foreign persons that could create a heightened risk of coercion.  7(b)\nconcerns relationships with foreign persons, organizations, governments, or countries that pose a risk\nof a conflict of interest.  Regarding the former, a Judge can be expected to examine the nature and\nextent of the relevant contacts, while, with the latter, he or she would consider the nature of the\nrelationships at stake.  However, the plain language of these two provisions permits a significant\ndegree of overlap, and the same circumstances may in fact raise concerns under both disqualifying\nconditions.  This is especially true regarding family members, persons with whom an applicant may\nwell have significant contact and with whom he is bound into lifelong relationships.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 07-04496 at n. 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2008), which recognized that foreign family members\ncould raise security concerns under both of the disqualifying conditions at issue here.   \nAccordingly, we conclude that there is no error in the Judge\u2019s application of both\ndisqualifying conditions 7(a) and (b).  While his having done so could be expected to have affected\nhis evaluation of the Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, we find no reason to believe that Applicant was\nunfairly prejudiced in presenting his case.  Even if the Judge had limited his analysis only to 7(a) and\n(e) (see n. 1 supra), Applicant\u2019s family circumstances and his economic interests in Pakistan are such\nthat it is unlikely the Judge would have found the security concerns arising therefrom to have been\nmitigated.  We conclude that the Judge did not apply the disqualifying conditions in such a way as\nto compromise the fairness of the hearing and that Applicant was not deprived of the due process\nrights secured by the Directive.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in not having extended favorable application to\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(a), which sets forth a condition that can mitigate Guideline B security\nconcerns.   He states that there is no record evidence that his family in Pakistan knew that he was\n3\napplying for a clearance; no evidence that he intended to disclose to his family that he had access to\nclassified information; and no evidence that his family would be at risk were Applicant to have\naccess to classified information.  We have considered this argument in light of the Judge\u2019s findings\nand the record evidence.  The Board has previously held that such factors as relatives\u2019 obscurity or\nthe failure of foreign interests to contact those relatives in the past do not provide a meaningful\nmeasure of whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security risk.  See ISCR Case No. 07-13696\nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009).  Neither is the Government required to prove a threat of espionage.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09907 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2004).  Given findings and evidence that\n\n\u201c[I]n-laws represent a class of persons who are contemplated by the Directive as presenting a potential security\n4\nrisk.  As a matter of common sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of\naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-26176 at 5\n(App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2005).  \nThe presence of terrorist activity in a country is an important consideration in a Foreign Influence case.  ISCR\n5\nCase No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007).  \n\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\n6\nnational security.\u2019\u201d\n\u201c[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\n7\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest[.]\u201d\nWe must assume that, in promulgating the Directive to implement Executive Order 10865, officials made a\n8\ndetermination that the Directive and the Executive Order are compatible.  ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at n. 15 (App. Bd.\nOct. 7, 2004).  See also Asiana Airlines v. FAA, 134 F.3d at 398, n. 3 supra; and ISCR Case No. 98-0320 at (App. Bd.\nApr. 8, 1999), citing to the principle of statutory construction that different laws should be interpreted in such a manner\nas to give full force and effect to each, whenever practical.  \n5\n(1) Applicant has numerous relatives and in-laws  in Pakistan with whom he maintains contact; (2)\n4\nboth Applicant and his wife are dual citizens of Pakistan and the U.S.; (3) Applicant has a substantial\nfinancial interest within Pakistan; (4) Pakistan has a problematic human rights record; and (5)\nterrorist groups operate within Pakistan,  the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u00b6 8 (a) does not apply here is\n5\nnot error.  Similarly, his conclusion that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion under the\nstandard set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) is sustainable.    \n6\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in stating that Applicant\u2019s loyalty is not an issue.\nHe cites to Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(b)  in support of his contention that loyalty is an issue and\n7\nshould have been made a part of the Judge\u2019s analysis.  The challenged statement by the Judge is\nfound in that part of the Decision in which the Judge summarizes the policies set forth in the\nDirective.  The Judge quoted Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, included in the Directive at\nEnclosure 1.  This provision states \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall\nbe a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Applicant argues that, despite this language, \u00b6 8(b) requires\nconsideration of an Applicant\u2019s loyalty and that the Judge failed to do so.  \n In considering this issue, we note that provisions of the Directive should be interpreted as\nconsistent with one another.   The pertinent language in the Executive Order is to ensure that\n8\nclearance decisions do not create a stigma of disloyalty.  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(b), on the other\nhand, requires the Judge to balance an applicant\u2019s ties within the U.S. to his ties to a foreign person,\norganization, or country in analyzing the extent to which an applicant might find himself in a conflict\nof interest.  Accordingly, there is no conflict between the two provisions.  In the case at issue here,\nthe correct analysis would entail a balancing of Applicant\u2019s ties or obligations within the U.S. with\n\n\u201cAlthough this mitigating condition is partially applicable, it is insufficient to overcome the foreign influence\n9\nsecurity concerns. [Applicant] has contacts and close relationships with his mother, his siblings in Pakistan, and his sister\nliving in the United States, as well as in-laws in [third country].  They all have contacts and a close relationship with\nfamily members in Pakistan.\u201d  Decision at 10.    \n6\nhis ties or obligations to his family members in Pakistan, and the record demonstrates that the Judge\ndid so.   \n9\nApplicant cites some minor errors in the Judge\u2019s decision which are not reflective of the\nfindings and conclusions as a whole.  These errors are typographical in nature and thus harmless.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred by not favorably applying Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(f) in his\nfavor.  Given the quantity of Applicant\u2019s holdings in Pakistan, the Judge\u2019s conclusion was\nreasonable.  Additionally, Applicant cites to a speech by the President.  The text is a prospective\nstatement of objectives which does not address the security concerns in Applicant\u2019s case.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions as well as the whole-\nperson factors.

Applicant\u2019s wife was also born, raised, and educated in Pakistan. She and Applicant became U.S. citizens in the late 2000s. They have two children, both U.S. citizens. Applicant and his wife are citizens of the U.S., Pakistan, and another country. Applicant has numerous relatives who are citizens and/or residents of Pakistan. His mother lives there, and he speaks with her on the telephone approximately once a week. He also has two brothers living there. He speaks with one a few times a year and another nearly once a week. Applicant also has several sisters who reside in Pakistan and one who lives in the U.S. Additionally, he has several in-laws who live in Pakistan. He owns a home in that country, valued at $250,000. He also owns some commercial real estate there valued at about $50,000. His net worth in the U.S. is about $150,000. Pakistan is a parliamentary federal republic which supported the U.S. in removing the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. However, terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda operate within Pakistan, using the country as a safe haven for planning attacks on the U.S., India, and Europe. Pakistan has a poor human rights record. Due Process Violation Applicant has raised an issue of due process. Specifically, he argues that the Judge erred in concluding that two Guideline B disqualifying conditions (DC) both applied to Applicant\u2019s case. The Judge also concluded that disqualifying condition 7(e) applied. This condition reads as follows: \u201ca 1 substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owed or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation[.]\u201d Applicant\u2019s due process argument does not extend to this provision. Applicant relies on Asiana Airlines v. FAA, 134 F.3d 393, 398 (D.C. Cir. 1998), to the effect that a statute 2 should not be interpreted in such a way as to render its provisions void or superfluous. See DISCR Case No. 93-1050 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 1994), applying principles of statutory construction to the Directive. 3 He argues that the Judge\u2019s",
    "judges_analysis": "renders these two conditions duplicative of each other, working to the detriment of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. The DCs in question are found at Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b). The security 1 concern addressed by 7(a) is as follows: contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. 7(b), meanwhile, addresses connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. Applicant argues that 7(a) covers contact with family members, while (b) addresses broader relationships that may create conflicts of interest. Citing principles of statutory construction, he 2 argues that \u201cthe only individuals who [Applicant] has connections with in Pakistan are his own family members. If paragraph 7(b)\u2013which expressly does not mention family members\u2013applies to this situation, then paragraph 7(a) is rendered superfluous, an untenable result.\u201d He further contends that, as a consequence, Applicant was burdened in making his case for mitigation. \u201cIt is entirely possible that, if potentially disqualifying condition 7(b) was not considered, [Applicant] may have met his burden of proof on mitigating the Government\u2019s security concerns, at least with respect to disqualifying condition 7(a).\u201d We have considered this argument, in light of the record. While acknowledging that the Directive is subject to general principles of statutory construction, we do not conclude that the disqualifying and mitigating conditions are themselves most analogous to statutes. Rather, they are examples both of the kind of circumstances that can give rise to securi",

Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 12, 2008, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 30, 2009, and DOHA received \nhis answer on July 6, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 28, \nApril 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009, and I received the case assignment on July 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 21, 2009, scheduling the case for September 23, 2009. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until September 30, 2009, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE \nF through I, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 1, 2009. The record closed on October 1, 2009.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the summary \nof facts contained in Ex. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through VII. Without \nobjection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of facts as requested by \nDepartment Counsel. (Tr. 19-20.) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \nGovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nPakistan were derived from Exs. I(A), and I through VII as contained infra under the \nsubheading \u201cPakistan\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations.

He also \nreceived a Team Achievement Award in 2008, a cash achievement award, and an \nindividual achievement award, all in 2008. (AE F \u2013 I.) \n \nPakistan2 \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Pakistan is a parliamentary \nfederal republic in South Asia with a population of nearly 170 million people. Pakistan is \na low-income country, with a population that is 97% Muslim. It has a coalition \ngovernment led by Prime Minister Yousef Gilani and president Asif Ali Zardari, widower \nof assassinated Pakistan People\u2019s Party leader Benazir Bhutto. \n \n2 The contents of the Pakistan section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I(A) through VII. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAlthough Pakistan was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban \nregime of Afghanistan, after September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with \nthe Taliban and pledged support to the U.S. and international coalition in Operation \nEnduring Freedom to remove the Taliban from power. Despite this support, members of \nthe Taliban are known to be in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of \nPakistan and in the Balochistan Province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. The \nleader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, is operating openly in Pakistan. Extremists led by \nPakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban \u201cTTP\u201d) commander Baitullah Mehsud and other al-\nQaeda extremists have re-exerted their hold over areas in the FATA and the North West \nFrontier Province (NWFP). The TTP has gained support by promising to fill a vacuum \nleft by ineffective government structures.  \n \nStreams of Taliban financing crossing the border of Pakistan to Afghanistan has \nallowed the insurgency in Afghanistan to strengthen its military and technical \ncapabilities. In addition to the Taliban, the FATA in Pakistan continues to be a vital \nsanctuary to al-Qaeda and a number of foreign and Pakistan-based extremist groups. \nDespite Pakistani military operations against extremists that directly challenge Pakistani \ngovernment authority, Taliban, al-Qaeda, and other Pakistani militant groups continue to \nuse Pakistan as a safe haven for organizing, training, and planning attacks against the \nUnited States and its allies in Afghanistan, India, and Europe. Al-Qaeda and other \nAfghan extremist groups exploit that operating environment to plan operations, direct \npropaganda, recruit and train operatives, and raise funds. \n \n \nOverall, Pakistan has intensified counterinsurgency efforts, but its record of \ndealing with militants has been mixed. Pakistan has demonstrated determination and \npersistence in combating militants it perceives to be dangerous to Pakistan\u2019s interests, \nparticularly those involved in attacks in settled areas, but it has not consistently pursued \nmilitants focused on Afghanistan, and still considers militant groups to be important to \nits efforts to counter India\u2019s military and economic advantages. \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has defined terrorist safe havens as ungoverned, \nunder-governed, or ill-governed areas of a country and non-physical areas where \nterrorist groups that constitute a threat to U.S. national security interests are able to \norganize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, and operate in relative security \nbecause of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both. For those reasons \ndiscussed above and others, the U.S. Department of State has concluded that the \nAfghan-Pakistan border and the FATA, NWFP, and the Baluchistan areas of Pakistan \nare terrorist safe havens. \n \n \nThe Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to Pakistan \nin light of the threat of terrorist activity, specifically the presence of al-Qaeda, Taliban \nelements, and indigenous sectarian groups that pose a danger to American citizens. \nInternational terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, continue to carry out attacks in \nPakistan. In the last three months of 2009, Pakistan-based extremists and al-Qaeda \nconducted at least 40 suicide terrorist attacks in major cities in Pakistan, killing about \n600 Pakistani civilians and security force personnel. Terrorists and their sympathizers \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhave demonstrated their willingness and capability to attack targets where Americans \nare known to congregate or visit. Also, since 2007, several American citizens \nthroughout Pakistan have been kidnapped. \n \n \nThe human rights situation in Pakistan remains poor. Major problems include \nextrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances. Additional problems include poor \nprison conditions, arbitrary arrest, widespread government corruption, rape, honor \ncrimes, and widespread trafficking in persons. The military operations in the FATA and \nNWFP resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,150 civilians, and militant attacks in the \nFATA and NWFP killed 825 more civilians. The Pakistani government also maintains \nseveral domestic intelligence services that monitored politicians, political activists, \nsuspected terrorists, the media, and suspected foreign intelligence agents. Credible \nreports indicated that authorities routinely used wiretaps and intercepted and opened \nmail without the requisite court approval, as well as monitoring mobile phones and \nelectronic messages. \n \n \n In addition to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other insurgents and militants, foreign \nterrorist organization Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LT) also operates out of Pakistan. The LT is \nthe prime suspect for the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and is one of the largest and \nmost proficient of the traditionally Kashmiri-focused militant groups. The LT has \nconducted a number of operations against Indian troops and civilian targets since 1993. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AGs. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AGs list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the Government\u2019s concern is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.3  \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection or obligation \nwith his mother and siblings, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan, as well as with \nsome of his in-laws, who are citizens of Pakistan. The closeness of these relationships \nis shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with his relatives, directly or through his \nwife, his commercial and residential property in Pakistan, and family visits to Pakistan.  \n \n  \nThe threat of terrorism in Pakistan is high. Over the years, Pakistan has suffered \nfrom numerous terrorist attacks. Terrorists in Pakistan target U.S. interests to exploit \nand undermine U.S. national security interests. They conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as state intelligence services. There is also the possibility that terrorists, \nextremists, or criminal organizations may exploit the opportunity to obtain sensitive or \nclassified U.S. information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s case requires the recognition that Pakistan and the United States \nhave a special political and economic relationship. At the same time it is also necessary \nto recognize that Pakistan is on the front lines in the war against international and \nregional terrorism and, despite the efforts of its government, there are individuals and \ngroups within Pakistan who have acted and continue to act in a hostile manner to U.S. \ninterests. \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I conclude that only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n8(b) partially applies. AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a \nrelationship and a sense of loyalty with the United States. He has continuously lived in \nthe United States with his family for approximately 12 years. He and his wife are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens and a significant portion of their financial and business \ninterests are in the United States. Applicant\u2019s two children are U.S.-born citizens. He \nhas established himself as an American citizen and he along with his family have \nintegrated into their local community. Applicant has a track record of diligent labor with \nhis employer. Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, it is insufficient to \novercome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nHe has contacts and close relationships with his mother, his siblings in Pakistan, \nand his sister living in the United States as well as his in-laws in Canada. They all have \ncontacts and a close relationship with family members in Pakistan.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his Pakistani \nfamily] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close relationships with \nmother and siblings in Pakistan could potentially force him to choose between the \nUnited States and Pakistan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [his relationships with his Iranian family members] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(e) does not apply. The cumulative value of Applicant\u2019s real estate in \nPakistan approximates $200,000, by his estimates, and exceeds the value of his U.S.-\n\n \n11 \n \n \nbased net worth. Although he testified that he plans to sell his Pakistani properties at \nsome point in the future, the fact remains he owns them now and they comprise a \nsubstantial amount of his assets. \n \nOn the other hand, there is no evidence that his family members or extended \nfamily members work for or associated with the Pakistani government or any news \nmedia. There is no evidence that the Pakistani government has approached any of his \nPakistani family for any reason. There is no evidence that his family living in Pakistan \ncurrently engages in activities which would bring attention to themselves or that they are \neven aware of her work.  \n \nNotwithstanding, foreign influence mitigating conditions cannot be fully applied in \nthis case, and the security concerns cannot be fully mitigated because there is no \nreason for Pakistan or any group hostile to the U.S. to contact his relatives about \nApplicant until he receives access to classified information. Even taking for granted that \nhis Pakistani family members currently have low-key non-controversial lifestyles, and \nthat the Pakistani government or a group hostile to the U.S. has not contacted them \nabout Applicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s testimony or demeanor suggested he was not a loyal U.S. \ncitizen and a credit to his adopted country. However, despite Applicant\u2019s sincere \ndemeanor and his assurances that he is not a security risk, the circumstances of his \nfamily situation argue otherwise. He was unable to put forward sufficient evidence that \ncould mitigate the security discussed herein and demonstrate that he would not be \nvulnerable to foreign influence that would result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant strongly averred his loyalty to the United States, he considers himself \nto be an American, and he desires to continue his work for his Government contractor \nemployer. Applicant has lived in the U.S. for 12 years and has been a naturalized citizen \nfor almost four years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the \nUnited States. His wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen and his two children are U.S. \nborn citizens.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant travelled to Pakistan on three separate occasions \nduring the last seven years. He has numerous immediate family members, who are \ncitizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant and his family enjoy a close relationship. \nHe has strong ties of affection and or obligation to his mother and siblings. Because \nApplicant\u2019s family members live in Pakistan, they are vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by Pakistan or by groups hostile to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s statement about his \nloyalty to the United States is credible. He has the respect and trust of his employer.  \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nThe political situation in Pakistan is volatile and groups hostile to U.S. interests are \nactive. Applicant was born in Pakistan and spent the first 40 years of his life there. He \nmet and married his wife in Pakistan. He received his education through college in \nPakistan. He has family members who are Pakistani citizens living in Pakistan and he \nand his wife remain in touch with these relatives. Applicant has frequent and non-casual \ndirect and vicarious contact with his mother and his siblings living in Pakistan. He has \nsignificant real estate holdings in Pakistan and maintains his Pakistani citizenship. \nThese cumulative factors create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Pakistani agents or terrorists may attempt to \nuse Applicant\u2019s family members living in Pakistan to obtain sensitive or classified \ninformation about the United States.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                     \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant4 \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. \u2013 1.g.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j. \u2013 1.n.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted responsibility for the six debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h.3 He also admitted additional delinquent debts were discharged in October 1998 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He also described his resolution or attempted resolution of the six debts he admitted. He denied the remainder of the delinquent debts. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor.4 He has been an aircraft electrician/mechanic for 25 years (Item 4 at 3). He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1974 to August 1978. When he received his honorable discharge, he was an E-5 (Item 4 at 4). He married his spouse in 1976. His two children were born in 1997 and 1995. He attended college from September 1997 to December 2000. From November 1983 to the present, he was unemployed three times: (1) from August 1997 to February 1998; (2) from January to February 2000; and (3) from November 2001 to January 2002. In 2008, he was deployed to Iraq on behalf of his employer (Item 4 at 4). He has held a security clearance and worked on classified projects for many years (Item 4 at 4). 1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 5, 2009; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated November 19, 2009 (file).

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nIn October 1998, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged through Chapter 7 of the \nBankruptcy Code. His statement of reasons (SOR) lists eight delinquent debts totaling \n$24,543, which were incurred after his bankruptcy. His history of financial problems, \ncombined with his failure to make sufficient effort to resolve four of his delinquent debts, \ncauses security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 5, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions \n(SF 86) (Item 5). On June 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (Item 1), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) \n(Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). \n \nOn July 8, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated October 2, 2009, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on February 4, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted responsibility for the six debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h.3 He also admitted additional delinquent debts \nwere discharged in October 1998 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He also \ndescribed his resolution or attempted resolution of the six debts he admitted. He denied \nthe remainder of the delinquent debts. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor.4 He has been an \naircraft electrician/mechanic for 25 years (Item 4 at 3). He served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps from August 1974 to August 1978. When he received his honorable discharge, \nhe was an E-5 (Item 4 at 4). He married his spouse in 1976. His two children were born \nin 1997 and 1995. He attended college from September 1997 to December 2000. From \nNovember 1983 to the present, he was unemployed three times: (1) from August 1997 \nto February 1998; (2) from January to February 2000; and (3) from November 2001 to \nJanuary 2002.  In 2008, he was deployed to Iraq on behalf of his employer (Item 4 at 4). \nHe has held a security clearance and worked on classified projects for many years (Item \n4 at 4). \n \n \n1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 5, 2009; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated November \n19, 2009 (file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to \nsubmit information (file). On December 9, 2009, Applicant requested an extension, and DOHA granted an \nextension until January 18, 2010 (file). \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nJuly 8, 2009, SOR response (Item 4). \n \n4Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 5, 2008, SF 86 (Item 5). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant did not disclose any unpaid judgments, unpaid liens, garnishments, \nillegal drug use, alcohol-related offenses, or felonies on his March 5, 2008, security \nclearance application. He disclosed that a vehicle was repossessed in August 2006, \nand that the creditor sought about $10,000; however, he did not disclose any debts \ncurrently delinquent over 90 days, or 180 days delinquent in the last seven years.     \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists eight delinquent debts totaling $24,543. A detailed \ndescription of the status of those debts follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($167) and 1.b ($1,109)\u2014DEBTS MERGED,5 BUT UNRESOLVED. \nThese two telecommunications debts related to the same delinquent account. Applicant \nsaid he disputed the $1,109 portion (Item 4 at 1). He offered to pay the creditor $167 to \nsettle the debt; however, the creditor refused this offer (Item 4 at 1).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($8,015)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant did not make his car payments \nas agreed (Item 4 at 1). Although he was discussing the payments with the creditor, the \ncreditor involuntarily repossessed his vehicle (Item 4 at 1). In his March 5, 2008, SF 86, \nhe explained the creditor \u201cwas not interested in resolving the problem\u201d (Item 5 at 9). On \nJuly 8, 2009, he said that he took responsibility for the debt and promised to make \npayments when he had resolved his other debts (Item 4 at 1). He did not provide any \ncorrespondence with the creditor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,194)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted responsibility for this \ndebt, and said he has \u201cmade arrangements to repay this debt at $100 per month\u201d (Item \n4 at 2). However, he did not indicate he had made any payments. There is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant has an established payment plan. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($104)\u2014PAID. Applicant admitted responsibility for this medical debt, \nand said he paid it on July 2, 2009 (Item 4 at 2). Although he did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence establishing this debt was paid, I accept his uncorroborated \naverment as fact.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,695)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant denied responsibility for this debt \nand said he had been disputing it for many months (Item 4 at 2). He did not provide the \ncorrespondence with the creditor showing the basis of the dispute. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($42)\u2014PAID. Applicant admitted responsibility for this debt, and said \nhe paid it on November 5, 2008 (Item 4 at 2, 8). He provided correspondence from the \ncreditor, which corroborated his statement of payment (Item 4 at 2).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($12,217)\u2014RESOLVED. Applicant admitted responsibility for this \ndebt (Item 4 at 2). On January 17, 2009, the creditor accepted Applicant\u2019s quit claim \n \n5The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is mitigated as a duplication of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndeed to settle the debt (Item 4 at 9). He provided the quit claim deed to corroborate his \nstatement about resolution (Item 4 at 9).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement includes the following information: his \ngross monthly salary is $8,500;6 his monthly net salary is $6,500; his monthly expenses \nare $5,350; his monthly debt payments are $1,405; and his monthly net remainder is \n$45 (Item 6 at 4). \n \nApplicant explained that the 1998 bankruptcy resulted from lack of income while \nApplicant was in college (Item 6 at 5). Their son was born, and his wife was unable to \nwork outside the home (Item 6 at 5). \n  \nOn February 16, 2009, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories (Item 6 at \n2). The DOHA interrogatories asked him to \u201cprovide documentation verifying payments, \nand current status\u201d of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c to 1.h, and two other non-SOR \ndebts. He denied knowledge of the two non-SOR debts (Item 6 at 5). He addressed the \nother SOR debts by sending a letter to the creditors asking for confirmation of the debt \nand the amount to settle the debt, if confirmed (Item 6 at 11). He explained: \n \n[He] fell into the housing finance trap. We took a bad home loan, foolishly, \nthat really put us over our heads based on the income we were making at \nthat time.7 Thus the reason we are, right now, working backwards to \nresolve old credit issues. \n \n(Item 6 at 5). \n \nApplicant noted that he and his wife have \u201cspent time with financial advisors to \nhelp [them] understand and change [their] money management skills.\u201d (Item 4 at 3). \nTheir financial management advisor has shown Applicant correct ways to budget (Item \n4 at 3). \n   \nThe FORM at 6 reminded Applicant that additional corroborating documentation \nwas important to resolving security concerns stating: \n \nHowever, in the absence of additional documentary evidence \nsubmitted in response to this FORM to show that Applicant has \nacted in \u201cgood faith\u201d to repay or settle his unresolved debts, as \n \n6Applicant provided a pay statement, dated October 3, 2008, indicating his gross pay to date for \n2008 was $114,641 (Item 6 at 12). His gross pay for September 12-25, 2008, was $8,401 (Item 6 at 12). \nHis pay statement for January 16-29, 2009, was $6,003 (Item 6 at 13). A substantial part of his income is \nfrom overtime.     \n \n7Applicant\u2019s credit report includes a $290,000 mortgage, which was 120 days past due until it was \nsettled for less than full balance (Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 6). The foreclosure account was closed in January \n2008 (Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 6). No adverse inference is drawn from this debt because it was not listed on \nthe SOR, and Applicant has not had an adequate opportunity to fully explain the circumstances of this \ndebt\u2019s resolution.      \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nrepresented in his Answer, and to document his utilization of \nfinancial counseling, Applicant\u2019s overall financial instability remains a \nlingering concern impacting his eligibility for a security clearance.    \n \nId. (emphasis in original). Applicant did not provide any documentation after he received \nthe FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \u201cIt \nis well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the \nsubstantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under [Directive] \u00b6 \nE3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish \neither that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) (internal citation omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his response \nto DOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response. His debts, including a delinquent car \nloan and several collection accounts, have been delinquent for a substantial period of \ntime.  \n \nApplicant paid two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). One debt was a duplication (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). Another debt was resolved through a quit claim deed (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant said \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhe was starting a payment plan on one debt (SOR 1.d). He said he was disputing two \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f). After he paid his other debts, he planned to start a payment \nplan on SOR \u00b6 1.c. However, he did not provide any supporting documentary evidence \nof such payments, such as an account statement from the creditor or his bank account \nstatements. There is insufficient evidence of an established payment plan. He did not \nprovide sufficient information about his overall financial situation to establish that he was \nunable to start payment plans on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. \n       \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent \nSOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by \nunemployment from August 1997 to February 1998, from January to February 2000, \nand from November 2001 to January 2002. The first period of unemployment caused \nhis bankruptcy in October 1998. However, he has not been unemployed since January \n2002, and has ample income to address his delinquent debts. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to his unresolved SOR debts. The two income statements he provided appear \nto indicate that he had income in 2008 of substantially more than $100,000. He did not \nprove that he had insufficient income to resolve or at least to establish payment plans \nfor the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f.8  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant and his wife spent time with financial \nadvisors to help them understand and change their money management skills. They \nlearned how to budget. This is sufficient to satisfy the financial counseling requirement. \nHe generated a budget as part of his personal financial statement. Applicant cannot \nreceive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has not paid, started payment plans, \nadequately disputed, or otherwise resolved four of his SOR debts. There are some \ninitial, positive \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He \nhas admitted some responsibility for three of the four unresolved SOR debts. Although \nhe may have a payment plan on one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d), he did not provide \ndocumentation showing any payments to this creditor. He promised to eventually \nresolve his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He also established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nbecause he showed some good faith9 in the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting \nresponsibility for most of his SOR debts, payment of two SOR debts, resolving his time-\nshare with a quit claim deed, and promising to resolve his delinquent SOR debts.  \n \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant said he disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f. He also thought the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c treated him unfairly when his vehicle was involuntarily \nrepossessed. However, he did not provide evidence showing he has \u201ca reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of [his] past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e) cannot be applied to mitigate \nthese three debts. \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment for more \nthan five years, and he has not shown significant progress on his SOR debts. His steps \nare simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant is 53 years old. He is sufficiently mature to \nunderstand and comply with his security responsibilities. He has been an aircraft \nelectrician/mechanic for 25 years. In 2008, he was deployed to Iraq on behalf of his \nemployer. He has held a security clearance and worked on classified projects for many \nyears. He attended college from September 1997 to December 2000. He married his \nspouse in 1976. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1974 to August 1978. \nWhen he received his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, he was an E-5. He \ndeserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an \nemployee of a defense contractor. There is no evidence that he has ever violated \nsecurity rules. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nDepartment of Defense, and his employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol \nor uses illegal drugs. He has never been fired from a job or left employment under \nadverse circumstances. His unemployment from August 1997 to February 1998, from \nJanuary to February 2000, and from November 2001 to January 2002 contributed to his \nfinancial woes. He paid two debts for $104 and $42. He resolved his time-share debt \nusing a quit claim deed. One SOR debt is a duplication of another SOR debt. These \nfactors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He began to have financial \ndifficulties several years ago during a period of unemployment. In October 1998, his \ndebts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In February 2008, he \nwas fully aware of the debts raising security concerns when he responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories, and in July 2009, in his SOR response, he discussed his SOR debts. He \nhad ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to contact his \ncreditors. He did not make sufficient progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did \nnot pay, start payments, document and justify any disputes, or otherwise resolve four \nSOR debts. He had sufficient income to make greater progress. I do not accept his \nstatement that he was starting a payment plan on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d as sufficient to \nshow he has an established payment plan on this debt. His promise to pay the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is insufficient to mitigate this debt because he has had the income to start a \npayment plan and has not done so. The FORM provided clear notice to Applicant that \nadditional documentation was essential to show his efforts to resolve several SOR \ndebts; however, he did not provide any documentation in response to the FORM.  \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant made insufficient progress to resolve his delinquent SOR \ndebts, even though he had steady employment for the last seven years and ample \nopportunity to contact his SOR creditors and provide documentation. He was on clear \nnotice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories, and even more so after he received the \nSOR and the FORM, that he needed to show substantial progress in the resolution of \nhis delinquent SOR debts; however, he did not provide documentation showing his \nefforts to accomplish this security responsibility.    \n   \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Architect, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 10, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\n           Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on August 7, 2008.  On August 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines B and C for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 2, 2009, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on July 23, 2010.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on July 29, 2010, and he submitted a reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on August 19, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nconcerning the current political conditions in Iran.  (FORM at pp. 5 - 20 and attachments\n1 thorough 16.)  Applicant has no objection.  The request and the attached documents\nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDING OF FACTS\nThe Applicant is 50 years old and married.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Architect, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence, which could result in the\ncompromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Tehran, Iran in 1959.  He migrated to the United\nStates in 1977, at the age of seventeen.  He attended college from 1986 to 1989, and\nobtained a Bachelor\u2019s Degree.  Over the next twenty-three years, he lived and worked\nin the United States and made it his permanent home.  In September 1999, he became\na naturalized United States citizen.  In 2001, he obtained a United States passport.\nThat same year, he married a native born United States citizen.  He is a dual citizen of\nIran and the United States.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  \nHis mother, father and sister are citizens of Iran.  His parents reside in Iran.  His\nmother is a 75 year old retired school teacher.  His father is an 86 year old retired civil\nengineer.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  The Applicant maintains regular telephonic contact\nwith them on a weekly basis.  His sister currently resides in the United States but he has\nno contact with her.  The Applicant states that neither his parents nor his sister are\nassociated in any way with the Iranian government, nor are they are aware that he is\napplying for a security clearance.  The Applicant began working for his current employer\nin April 2008.  (Government Exhibit 4.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a\nway as to show a preference for another country over the United States.\nThe Applicant applied for and obtained an Iranian passport in 1976, for the\npurposes of traveling to Iran.  After becoming a United States citizen in 1999, he\nrenewed his Iranian passport in May 2004, and used it to enter and exit Iran in March or\nApril 2005, during his travel to Iran to visit his parents.   His Iranian passport expired in\nMay 2009.  When learning of DoD\u2019s policy concerning possession of a foreign passport,\n\n3\nthe Applicant gave his passport to the security officer at his company for safekeeping, to\nbe returned when needed.  (See Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)  He has not destroyed\nhis Iranian passport.  (See Government Exhibit 3 and Response to the FORM.)  The\nApplicant states, \u201cI have maintained my dual citizenships [sic] only to enable me to\ntravel to Iran in cases of medical emergencies that may occur due to the aging of my\nparents\u201d.  (Response to FORM at p. 3.)  In fact, he indicates that he would not renounce\nhis Iranian citizenship because he wants the ability to travel to Iran to visit his parents\nwithout being harassed by the Iranian government.  (Government Exhibit 3.)\nIn the past, when the Applicant\u2019s previous security officer, to whom he had given\nhis passport for safekeeping, terminated her position with the company, the Applicant\u2019s\npassport was returned to him.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are\nnot limited to the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, and\nother weapon of mass destruction, (2) its sponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its\nintervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine the\nMiddle East peace process, and (5) its human rights violation against its own people.\nAs a result of these concerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.  Also, the United\nStates does not encourage travel to Iran.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided\ninto \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\n \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \n\n4\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry;\n11.  (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The voluntariness of participation;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress;\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in foreign influence and foreign preference that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant is subject to foreign influence (Guideline B) and has a foreign preference\n(Guideline C).  This evidence indicates unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines B and C of the SOR.\n\n6\nUnder Foreign Influence, Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe mitigation conditions are applicable.  \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  Although he has\nlived in the United States for many years, has become a naturalized citizen, and is\nmarried to a native born American citizen, he has close, immediate family members in\nIran that he has a strong emotional bond with.  This is evidenced by his regular weekly\ntelephonic contact with his parents in Iran.  The nature of his relationship with his\nparents in Iran is not casual and/or infrequent, but clearly of a nature that is regular,\nconsistent and ongoing. This deep emotional bond with his parents in Iran are foreign\ncontacts that pose a security risk.  Under the heightened scrutiny analysis, the\nApplicant\u2019s family in Iran pose a significant security risk.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under this guideline.   \nAdmittedly, the Applicant is a citizen of Iran by birth.  However, he has exercised\na right and privilege of a foreign citizen, by applying for and using an Iranian passport,\nafter becoming a United States citizen.  Although he has recently given his now expired\nIranian passport to his company\u2019s security department, he has not \u201csurrendered\u201d the\npassport in a manner that satisfies the language, meaning and intent of the regulation.\nSince, he may retrieve it at any time, and renew it, it has not been surrendered.  He has\nnot destroyed it, nor does he intend to.  It is apparent that he will use it in the future if he\ndecides to travel to Iran.  He has specifically indicated that he does not wish to\nrenounce his Iranian citizenship because he would like to travel to Iran to visit his\nparents when he chooses.    \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member applies.  Mitigation Conditions 11(a) dual\ncitizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country and, 11(e)\nthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated are arguably applicable in this case, but are not controlling here.\nThe Applicant is not willing to renounce his dual citizenship with Iran that clearly shows\na foreign preference.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under this guideline.  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, including his favorable\nrecommendations, however, it does not mitigate the negative effects of his foreign\ninfluence and foreign preference and the effects that it can have on his ability to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She submitted interrogatory answers (Item 7) concerning\ndelinquent accounts to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) adjudicators\non February 24, 2009. On March 24, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations (Guideline F). The\naction was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nNovember 13, 2009\n\n Applicant incorrectly indicated that the duplicate entry was SOR \u00b6 1.e. (answer to SOR). \n1\n In her answer to the SOR, she mistakenly identified this account as SOR \u00b6 1.f.\n2\n2\nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on May 14, 2009. She requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on July 16, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on July\n28, 2009. Her response was due on August 27, 2009. No response was received.

($7,075), a judgment was entered against Applicant in\nOctober 2004. Applicant admitted the debt and provided documentation showing she\nhad worked out a payment plan calling for $50 payments every two weeks. No\nadditional information was provided. As with SOR \u00b6 1.a., the statute of limitations for\njudgments in this state is 12 years. \nApplicant admitted the delinquent account identified in SOR \u00b6 1.c. ($9,630). She\nprovided documentation indicating the creditor offered to settle the account on May 21,\n2009 for $2,661. No additional information was provided. \nApplicant stated in her answer that she could not locate the creditor identified in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d. ($314). She claimed she paid the delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.e. ($152)\non May 22, 2009. No additional documentation was provided to verify that her check\nwas processed and/or that the amount was withdrawn from Applicant\u2019s checking\naccount. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.g. ($1,253)  explaining that the account was removed\n2\nfrom her credit report when the collection agency did not provide information within the\n\n3\nstatutorily mandated 30-day period.

In that period, she also made payments on\nthree other delinquent accounts (unlisted). Her total payments amounted to $1,166. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted no evidence of her job performance. She supplied no\ncharacter evidence of her lifestyle away from the job. Lastly, there is no evidence she\nhas had financial counseling. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept\" that brings together all available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nAG \u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nBoth AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) apply to the circumstances of this case.\nCarrying delinquent debt of more than $14,500 means Applicant is unable to satisfy her\ndebt. Having a documented history of past due delinquent accounts and judgments that\ndate to June 2002 constitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations that is likely\nto continue in the future. See also, ninth factor of the whole person concept.\nFive mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. No mitigation is available\nunder AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). Applicant still owes more\nthan $14,500 in debt. She has provided no evidence that convinces me the\nindebtedness will not continue. The absence of a comprehensive plan that addresses\nmost or all the past due accounts raises ongoing doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and\nreliability. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) does not apply. The mitigator refers to unemployment, economic issues,\nmedical issues, and marital problems, as unanticipated events that may hamper or\nimpede a person from paying their debts. Applicant has raised none of the foregoing\nissues, and I cannot assume that they caused or exacerbated her financial problems. \n\n5\nApplicant needs financial counseling to show her how to regain control of her\nfinances. AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ndoes not apply because she has furnished no evidence of counseling. \nApplicant receives some consideration under AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) based on the\npay-offs and settlements she made to four unlisted creditors. However, Applicant has\nfurnished no evidence regarding payments to creditors listed in the SOR.\nDocumentation that a payment plan has been established to repay an account means\nlittle without documented payments under the plan. Applicant demonstrated she\ncomprehended the importance of documentation in her interrogatory answers in which\nshe supplied documentation from the unlisted creditors showing she made payments or\nsettlements. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue) has limited application because Applicant employed some of the procedures to\ndispute SOR \u00b6 1.g. However, the dispute is not complete until the dispute is processed\nthrough one of the three credit agencies. They research the account and return current\ninformation within a reasonable period of time. Their reports will show either that the\naccount has been removed and why, or they will reaffirm the account with reasons for\ntheir reaffirmation. The limited mitigation Applicant is credited with under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d)\nand 20(e) is not sufficient to successfully rebut, extenuate, and mitigate the adverse\nevidence under the financial considerations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe record shows that Applicant has had financial problems since June 2002. By\n2006, Applicant had incurred a second judgment, a car repossession, and a wage\ngarnishment. She exercised good judgment in paying off or settling four unlisted\ndelinquent accounts, and providing payments to three unlisted creditors between March\n2008 and February 2009. \nAs recently as August 27, 2009 (last day to respond to the FORM), Applicant had\nan opportunity to supply updated information regarding the payment arrangements she\nmade with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. She also had a chance to supply the canceled check or\nchecking account ledger to prove she had paid off SOR \u00b6 1.e. It is reasonable to infer\nfrom the lack of verification of payment that no payments were made. With no plan in\nexistence to comprehensively address the debts, it is likely the indebtedness will\ncontinue. The financial considerations guideline is resolved against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 1, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn May 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on May 27, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on June 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 12,\n2009, and the hearing convened on August 13, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified, and one additional witness testified on her behalf. She also\nsubmitted Exhibits A through G, which were entered into evidence without objection.\n\n2\nThe transcript (Tr) was received on August 20, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 29 years old. She was previously married, and she has two children.\nApplicant is a high school graduate. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists two allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. and 1.b., under Adjudicative\nGuideline F.\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $45,000.\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $150,000. \nIn her RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant admitted that both of these\nallegations are correct. These two debts were as a result of a home equity loan and a\nfirst mortgage loan on the home that she previously owned with her husband (Tr at 27). \nApplicant testified that in July 2001, she, and her boyfriend at the time,\npurchased a home together. In 2002, they married, and the marriage formally ended in\nJanuary 2007. Applicant testified that during the later years that she and her husband\nwere living together, he stopped working and spent a lot of their money on drugs. She\nworked overtime for a period of one and one half years, just so that she could earn\nenough to pay their bills (Tr at 35). In September 2006, because she was the victim of\ndomestic violence from her husband, she fled her home with her two young children. \nIn October 2006, she filed a  restraining order against her husband because of\nthe domestic violence. Exhibit E is a copy of an \u201cExtended Order For Protection Against\nDomestic Violence\u201d filed by Applicant against her husband on January 9, 2007, which\nwas first issued on October 23, 2006, for the protection of Applicant from her husband.\nWhen she left the home, a family court judge ordered her husband to continue making\nthe mortgage payments on the house, make the necessary repairs, and obtain the\nservices of a realtor to place the home on the market for sale (Tr at 31). \nApplicant testified that her husband paid the mortgage for one month, but\nthereafter failed to make any additional payments. He lived in the house for a total of\n\n3\nfive months, before he moved out of the home, as a result of the order of the family\ncourt judge. After her husband vacated their home, Applicant\u2019s father brought the\nmortgage and equity loans up to date, and even paid one additional year on both loans.\nDuring that one year period the house was unoccupied. Because her husband had\nseriously damaged the home, she had to have the home repaired to make it\nmarketable, and her father contributed an additional $12,000 to make the necessary\nrepairs. She thereafter place the home for sale, but despite the house being on the\nmarket for more than two years, and its price being continually reduced from $320,000\nto as low as $150,000, she was unable to sell the home. On March 20, 2009, the bank\nforeclosed on her home (Tr at 31-33). \nShe has now filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for the two debts listed on the SOR.\nExhibit B consists of the court documents showing that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy was\nfiled by Applicant on August 3, 2009, in the United States Bankruptcy Court. \nApplicant testified that, with the exception of these two debts, she is, and has\nalways been, current on all of her other debts. She has even paid several months in\nadvance for her present rent (Tr at 37-38, 43-44). Her ex-husband has been ordered to\npay her $866 a month, but since he is not working, she currently receives $400 a month\nfrom his unemployment compensation (Tr at 40-41). \nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on her behalf. He has known Applicant for two\nyears and been her supervisor for the past year. He described her as \u201can excellent\nworker, willing to learn, and always bettering [herself]\u201d (Tr at 47).  Additionally, as\nsomeone who has held a security clearance for five years, he indicated that he would\nstrongly recommend her for a security clearance, and he does not believe that she\nwould ever jeopardize national security (Tr at 49).\nApplicant also offered into evidence eight very positive character letters from\nindividuals who have known Applicant in a variety of settings (Exhibit A). She was\ndescribed in such laudatory terms as \u201ctrustworthy, responsible, honest and courteous.\u201d\nExhibit F consists of three certificates of achievement or commendation that\nApplicant  has received from her current employer. Exhibit G has documents she\nreceived from a credit counseling course taken by Applicant on July 24, 2009. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had  financial difficulties and\noverdue debts.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\n\n5\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated two significant delinquent debts that she has\nbeen unable to satisfy. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 there are certain conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from the domestic abuse Applicant suffered form her\nex-husband, which forced her to flee from her own home with her two young children. \nDespite this situation, when Applicant was given the opportunity to resolve the\nfinancial difficulties from the home, she, with the help of her father, brought the\ndelinquent loans up to date and even paid for an additional year on these debts. She\nmade the necessary repairs to make the home marketable, and she thereafter placed\nthe home on the market, and attempted to sell the home for more than two years,\ncontinually lowering the selling price. However, because of the falling economy and\nhome values, she was unable to sell the home, which ultimately was lost in foreclosure.\nApplicant thereafter continued to act responsibly by availing herself of the legal remedy\nof bankruptcy. l find this mitigating condition is a significant factor for consideration in\nthis case as Applicant has continually done everything reasonably possible to try to\nresolve this very difficult situation. \n Applicant is currently financially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I\nconclude that she has mitigated the financial concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove, as to why the Mitigating Condition applies, and considering the testimony of the\nadditional witness, the character letters and the other mitigating evidence discussed\nabove, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old heavy-duty truck driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Between May 1997 and August 2005, Applicant served in the active reserves of the U.S. Army (see ex. 1). He re-enlisted in the Army reserves in 2005, but encountered difficulties inprocessing (see ex. 2). Unable to inprocess, for reasons unknown to hm at the time, he returned home. Three years later (around March 2007), he was informed by local police that the U.S. Army was looking for him (ex. 2). Pending arrival of his military orders, he was taken into custody. When he arrived at the designated military facility he was inprocessed and taken before a military judge to explain his situation. Once he explained the circumstances of his absence, he was granted an honorable discharge from the Army and released (see ex. 2). Applicant married his first wife in March 1980 (ex. 1) at the age of 21, and has two adult children from this marriage (Tr. 22). Both he and his wife were young and irresponsible at the time and incurred a considerable amount of credit-related debt (see ex. 2). In both his security clearance application (e-QIP) and his interrogatory answers, he reported that he divorced her around September 1999 (see exs. 1 and 2).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn July 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended\nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security  clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 27, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on September 1, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 6, 2009. A hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, the government's case\nconsisted of six exhibits (ex. 1-6).  Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no\nMarch 24, 2010\n\n2\nexhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2009.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record\nwith his documented annulment papers, verification of accounts belonging to his ex-wife,\nhis arrangements with his account monitor, and character references. For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant submitted the following documentary exhibits:\na cover letter detailing the status of his listed accounts; inquiry letters covering two of his\ncreditors (not identified), a billing and settlement offer from an unlisted creditor, a receipt\nof payment in full from creditor 1.j, and a documented request for records from the divorce\ncourt that houses Applicant\u2019s divorce records.  His  post-hearing exhibits were admitted as\nexhibits A through E.\nApplicant submitted additional documentation for consideration: a cover letter and\ncopies of papers included in his ex-spouse\u2019s divorce petition.  His submission included an\nexpense declaration from Applicant and his ex-wife\u2019s income and expense declaration\n(which includes the creditor 1.e debt). This post-hearing exhibit was submitted out of time,\nbut without any objection from Department Counsel, and for good cause, was  admitted\nas exhibit F.\nIn another post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted a cover letter and account\nstatements from creditors 1.h and 1.i covering their delinquent accounts with Applicant.\nLike exhibit F, this submission was filed out of time, and for good cause, was admitted as\nexhibits G through I. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated fourteen delinquent\ndebts that exceed $20,000 in the aggregate.  The debts are listed as follows:: \u00b6 1.a ($760),\n\u00b6 1.b ($13,481), \u00b6 1.c ($955), \u00b6 1.d ($765), \u00b6 1.e ($1,071),  \u00b6 1.f ($305), \u00b6 1.g ($581), \u00b6 1.h\n($68), \u00b6 1.I ($2,270), \u00b6 1.j ($210), \u00b6 1.k ($865), \u00b6 1.l ($927), \u00b6 1.m ($13,481), and \u00b6 1.n\n($1,120). \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations in the SOR.\nHe denied five of the allegations (\u00b6 \u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n), and claimed these debts\nbelong to his ex-wife. He explained that he has not taken his credit seriously in the past,\nand is now taking an active role in cleaning up his old accounts.  He claimed one of the\naccounts is paid off (\u00b6 1.m) and is working on resolving the remaining accounts. \n\n3\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old heavy-duty truck driver for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBetween May 1997 and August 2005, Applicant served in the active reserves of the\nU.S. Army (see ex. 1). He re-enlisted in the Army reserves in 2005, but encountered\ndifficulties inprocessing (see ex. 2). Unable to inprocess, for reasons unknown to hm at the\ntime, he returned home.  Three years later (around March 2007), he was informed by local\npolice that the U.S. Army was looking for him (ex. 2).  Pending arrival of his military orders,\nhe was taken into custody. When he arrived at the designated military facility he was\ninprocessed and taken before a military judge to explain his situation. Once he explained\nthe circumstances of his absence, he was granted an honorable discharge from the Army\nand released (see ex. 2). \nApplicant married his first wife in March 1980 (ex. 1) at the age of 21, and has two\nadult children from this marriage (Tr. 22). Both he and his wife were young and\nirresponsible at the time and incurred a considerable amount of credit-related debt (see ex.\n2).  In both his security clearance application (e-QIP) and his interrogatory answers, he\nreported that he divorced her around September 1999 (see exs. 1 and 2).  However, in his\nhearing testimony, he claimed his marriage to his first wife was annulled (Tr. 43-44). \n Afforded an opportunity to document his annulment, Applicant provided excerpts\nof an apparently ongoing divorce proceeding (see ex. B). His divorce papers include a\ndeclaration from his estranged wife that they separated in February 2002 and were\ninvolved in a pending divorce proceeding (see ex. G).  In a summary of his interview with\nan agent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2008, he told the agent\nonly that he was previously married to his first wife; he omitted all of the details of his\nseparation and ensuing legal proceedings (see ex. 2). Based on the information he has\nprovided to date, the dates and circumstances surrounding the dissolution of his first\nmarriage are unclear. \nBetween 1992 and 2000, Applicant and his first wife accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts. Applicant cited several reasons for his debts: insufficient withheld income\nto cover his income taxes; unemployment (during parts of 2003, 2004, and 2005), forced\nassumption of some of the debts belonging to his ex-wife (ex. 2). He experienced\nadditional setbacks after his current wife was laid off from her job in the latter part of 2007\n(ex. 2).  While Applicant did not recognize some of the accounts in the SOR (Tr. 60-63),\nhe has never formally challenged any of the listed debts in the SOR.  All of these listed\ndebts are covered in Applicant\u2019s credit reports and heretofore have not been formally\nchallenged by Applicant (see exs. 3 through 6).  \nApplicant married his second wife sometime in November 2002 (see ex. 1). They\nhave no children from their marriage (see ex. 1).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s largest reported debt is a loan balance of $13,481 on a vehicle he\npurchased jointly with his second wife in June 2002. His credit report lists a purchase price\nof $27,256 and scheduled monthly payments of $517 on the installment loan balance (see\nexs. 3 and 4). Applicant and his wife never received a bill for the vehicle and returned it\nafter two or three months to the seller (Tr. 39). Upon their return of the vehicle, the seller\ntold them that the financing fell through (Tr. 39). The seller, in turn, informed Applicant and\nhis wife that they would place the lost sale in Applicant\u2019s credit report and treat it as a\ndefault (Tr. 40). The last reported loan balance on this returned vehicle when the account\nwas charged off in August 2002 was $13,481 (see ex. 4). Whether this sum represents the\ndeficiency balance on the original loan after according credit for proceeds from the seller\u2019s\nsale of the vehicle is not known.  \nWhen his current spouse began receiving her U.S. pension benefits in March 2008,\nApplicant looked forward to having additional funds to pay on his old debts. He assured the\nOPM investigator who interviewed him in May 2008 that he would be able to begin\naddressing the debts he could identify as his own (see ex. 2).  Besides his listed debts in\nthe SOR, Applicant has two outstanding tax liens he is currently addressing: one with the\nIRS for around $5,000 and others with his state of residence (Tr. .  \nTo date, Applicant has paid less than $300 (including his payoffs of creditors 1.j and\n1.m, and his partial payment on his creditor 1.h account) that he documents (see exs. C,\nD, F, and J). He provided no proof of repayment plans completed with any of his other\nlisted creditors, and no concrete plans to address any of his remaining creditors listed in\nthe SOR.\nIn the personal financial statement he completed in January 2009, Applicant\nreported net monthly income for his wife and himself of $6,235, and net monthly expenses\nof $3,965 (see ex. 2). His listed personal debts exceeded $13,000 (of which $11,000 is\nowed to the IRS), and monthly payments on these debts of $476 (see ex. 2).  Applicant\nlisted a monthly remainder of $1,793 and no additional allocated monies to his listed\ncreditors in the SOR.   He did not provide any updated financial statement or evidence of\nfinancial counseling.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding\nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The\nguidelines do not require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\n\n5\ndecision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in\naccordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) of\nthe revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nconcerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.\nIt may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires administrative judges\nto make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on\nthe relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial proceedings, the\njudge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial evidence\nany controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\ngovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a licensed truck driver for a defense contractor who accumulated\ndelinquent debts during periods of unemployment and difficulties with some of his tax\nobligations.  While he has addressed his tax obligations (not covered in the SOR), and paid\nseveral of his smaller debts, he has not been able to make any headway with his remaining\nbalances. His still outstanding delinquent debts raise continuing security concerns over the\nstability of his finances.   \nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR (sometimes\nreferred to as official admissions) negate the need for any independent proof (see\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6  ed. 2006)). All of his listed debts are fully documented\nth\nin his latest credit reports, and provide ample independent proof of his debts. Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nWith his limited payment history on his listed debts, and inability to address most\nof his debts, either before the hearing or within the extended time afforded him after the\nhearing to contact his creditors and obtain documentation of his claimed marriage\nannulment from his first wife, Applicant can not be credited with any more than modest\nprogress to date in regaining control of his finances. Based on his limited repayment record\nto date (a little more than $300 on a debt aggregate in excess of $20,000) he can provide\nno reliable assurances of any sustainable commitments to resolve his outstanding debts\nwith the income sources currently available to him. \n\n7\nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsome extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations. As a result, MC\n\u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly),\u201d has partial application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts with creditors 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m entitle him to some\nmitigation credit under MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating condition has partial\napplication to Applicant\u2019s situation, given the limited financial resources he has had to work\nwith over the past few years.  Full mitigation credit is not available to Applicant, however,\nbased on the facts of this case. Neither Applicant\u2019s oral nor written evidence reflect\nsufficient repayment efforts on his covered debts to warrant safe predictions that he can\nresolve his debt delinquencies within the foreseeable future. \nMoreover, even though Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies arose in large measure  due\nto disputed debts associated with his ex-wife and periods of unemployment, he could have\nbeen reasonably expected to have exerted more responsible efforts in fulfilling the\npromises he made to the OPM investigator who interviewed him after his finances\nimproved.  See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Not only are his listed\ndebt delinquencies ongoing, but he has failed to demonstrate any payment progress on\nall but a few of the debts since his divorce and remarriage.      \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s duties\nand access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust and\ncandor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically imposed\non government employees and contractors involved in other lines of government business.\nSee Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. While the principal\nconcern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to\ncoercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in financial cases.  Failure\nof the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts when able to do so\nraises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated\ntrust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts. While unemployment and\ncircumstances associated with his prior divorce play a considerable role in Applicant\u2019s\naccrual of his delinquent debts, Applicant has not provided sufficient documented\nexplanations as to why he has been unable to make more concerted efforts to repay or\n\n8\nresolve his outstanding debts since he and his current wife began accumulating more\navailable income.  \nBased on the documented payment information available for consideration in this\nrecord, the evidence is insufficient to enable Applicant to establish judgment and trust\nlevels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of his accumulation of delinquent\ndebts. Applicant\u2019s efforts to pay off his listed debts are encouraging. They remain a work\nin progress, though, and require more concrete efforts to address his debt delinquencies.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, his disagreements with his ex-wife over payment\nresponsibility, the limited resources he has had to address them in the past , and the\nmodest steps he has mounted to address his old debts with his current resources, it is still\ntoo soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his accrued\ndebts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security\nclearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, 1.I, 1.k through 1.l, and 1.n.  His documented\naddressing of the debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m are sufficient to\nmitigate security concerns associated with these debts.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each\nof the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.g, \n   1.I, 1.k through 1/l, and 1.n\n          \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparas 1h, 1.j, and 1.m:\n                      For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                 \nRoger C.

With his answer, he   \nrequested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The \nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 11, 2010. The \nFORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 12. On June 14, 2010, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on \nJune 22, 2010. His response was due on July 22, 2010. Applicant filed additional \ninformation within the required time period. On September 17, 2010, the case was \nassigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol \nConsumption, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b(1), 1.b(2), 1.b(3), 1.b(4), 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.) and four \nallegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \nthrough 2.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the eight Guideline G \nallegations, and he admitted three of the four Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.b., and \n2.c.). He denied the SOR allegation at \u00b6 2.d. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as \nfindings of fact. (Item 1; Item 4.) \n  \n \nThe facts in this case are established by the record provided by the Government \nand by Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. The record evidence includes Applicant\u2019s \n2006 e-QIP; the FORM from ISCR Case No. 02-13857, dated November 19, 20041; the \nDOHA administrative judge\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. 02-13857, dated February 17, \n2005; Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories concerning alcohol, dated October \n15, 2009; Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories (Adoption of Statement), dated \nOctober 15, 2009;2 Applicant\u2019s medical and alcohol treatment records; Applicant\u2019s \nChapter 13 bankruptcy records, and a credit bureau report for Applicant, dated February \n1, 2010. In his response to the FORM, Applicant provided information about his alcohol \nconsumption, his student loan debt, and his divorce from his second wife. (See Items 5 \nthrough 12 and Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.) \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior software engineer. From 1987 until 1995, he \nserved in the U.S. military. In 1993, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in \ncomputer science. He has worked for his present employer, a government contractor, \nsince 1998. He was first awarded a security clearance in 1996. (Item 5.) \n \n1 On August 23, 2004, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR. In response to the SOR, Applicant requested an \nadjudication on the record. DOHA then prepared and served Applicant with the FORM dated November \n19, 2004. \n \n2Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on July 25, 2008. On October 15, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant signed a \nnotarized statement affirming that he had read the summary of the interview and found it to be true and \ncorrect. He also added information about his abstinence from alcohol, his attendance at meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), and his church work. Additionally, he enclosed a copy of his 2008 \nperformance evaluation.  (Item 9.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant has been married and divorced twice. He married for the first time in \n1991, and he and his wife divorced in 1994. When he married for the second time in \n2000, Applicant became the step-father of two children, who are now young adults. \nApplicant was granted a divorce from his second wife in May 2010. The record does not \nreflect that children were born to either of Applicant\u2019s marriages. (Item 5; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to FORM at 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and older brother were alcoholics. Applicant began to consume \nalcohol in college. His average alcohol consumption was six or seven beers a day. \nFrom 1996 until at least August 2007, he consumed alcohol to excess and to the point \nof intoxication. (Item 1; Item 4; Item 9 at 2; Item 10 at 1.) \n \n \nIn August 2004, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR alleging two alcohol-related \nincidents and one treatment for alcohol dependence. Applicant requested that DOHA \nadjudicate his case on the record. A DOHA administrative judge reviewed the FORM in \nApplicant\u2019s case and made the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant was arrested in November 1996 and charged with Driving Under \nthe Influence (DUI). His blood alcohol levels were .147% and .162%. \nApplicant was found guilty of DUI, sentenced to one year supervised \nprobation, ordered to attend DUI Counterattack School and participate in a \nVictim Awareness Program, and to complete 50 hours of community \nservice. He was fined $492.50, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for six \nmonths.     \n \nFrom February 1997 until May 1997, Applicant received outpatient \ntreatment for a condition diagnosed as alcohol dependence. \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 2000 and charged with (1) Driving \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs and (2) Driving While Having a \n.08% or Higher Blood Alcohol Level. Count (1) was dismissed. Applicant \nwas found guilty of Count (2), sentenced to three years unsupervised \nprobation, fined $1,464, plus court costs, and sentenced to 48 hours in jail. \nHe was also ordered to attend a Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) program, \nand his driver\u2019s license was restricted for 90 days. \n \nApplicant continued to drink intoxicating beverages after he was \ndischarged from the program in which he had been treated for alcohol \ndependence in 1997.3  \n \n(Item 6; Item 7) \n \n \n3 Applicant completed Basic Outpatient Substance-Abuse Treatment on May 28, 1997. His discharge \ndiagnosis was \u201cAlcohol Dependence, (in apparent remission).\u201d His prognosis was good, provided he \nfollowed treatment recommendations to abstain from all mood-altering substances and attend AA \nmeetings. (Item 6.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant objected to the SOR allegation that he \ncontinued to abuse alcohol and, by letter dated November 11, 2004, he provided the \nfollowing information to the administrative judge: \n \nI am not sure how to put this, but I have made many positive changes in \nmy life since February 2002. During the months of February and March of \n2002, I really woke up, when my wife and stepchildren confronted me with \nmy drinking problem. I started going to a local church . . . where I live. I \nspoke with the pastor and he mentioned it would be a good idea to start \nattending [AA] meetings. At first I was scared, but when I stepped into the \nAA doors I realized for the first time that I needed this. After a few \nmeetings, I spoke up and got me a sponsor. A sponsor is a person that \nhad a drinking problem at sometime in his life. He really helps me if I get \nthe urge to drink. I have been in the AA program for over two years now. \nThis has changed my life. I spend my nights at home with my family, and \nwe have dinner together, and it\u2019s a joy. I also take time with my \nstepchildren now, and they love me. I go to my kid\u2019s games and events \nnow. \n \n(Item 6 at 5.) \n \n \nThe administrative judge weighed all of the evidence in light of the applicable \nadjudicative guideline and the whole-person standard. In February 2005, he granted \nApplicant a security clearance. (Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nIn early August 2007, Applicant visited his parents and other family members in a \nneighboring state. He father had suffered a stroke, and his mother was in hospice care. \nApplicant felt stress because of his parent\u2019s illnesses. His relatives were heavy drinkers, \nand Applicant felt social pressure to join them in drinking alcohol. Applicant drank \nalcohol with his relatives every day for a week. At the end of the week, he realized he \ncould not stop drinking by himself, and he sought medical help. (Item 9 at 2.) \n \n \nWhen he presented himself for treatment at a hospital, he was transferred by \nambulance to a mental health and chemical dependency facility. His diagnosis at \nadmission was Bipolar Disorder. His diagnosis by a physician at the hospital after \nevaluation was, in part, alcohol dependence. He was treated at the facility in August \n2007. He was treated at the facility also from December 2007 until January 2008.  (Item \n9 at 2; Item 10 at 12, 20.) \n \n \nClinical notes from the mental health and chemical dependency facility report that \nApplicant\u2019s Bipolar Disorder was treated with medication. In designing an individualized \ntreatment plan for Applicant, an interdisciplinary team of mental health professionals \nidentified Applicant\u2019s assets and strengths as \u201cmotivated for treatment\u201d and \u201cable to \nbenefit from [treatment] milieu.\u201d They identified his stressors or weaknesses as \u201cpoor \ncoping skills,\u201d financial difficulties,\u201d and \u201csubstance abuse.\u201d (Item 9 at 4; Item 10 at 15, \n25.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn discussing his alcohol consumption, Applicant stated that he had used alcohol \nsince 1987. He stated that consequences of his excessive alcohol use were compulsive \nspending, arguments with his wife about his alcohol use, two DUIs, blackouts, and \nwork-related stress. (Item 10 at 26.) \n \n \nAfter completing inpatient care, Applicant was provided with a discharge plan that \nincluded out-patient therapy, group aftercare, participation in a 12-step recovery group, \nand medication management. Clinical notes in the record reflect that Applicant was \ntreated at a family psychiatry practice and saw a psychiatrist for therapy from about \nSeptember 2007 until May 2009. (Item 10 at 8, 29-30.) \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in July 2008, Applicant stated that he intended never to \nuse alcohol in the future. He further stated that his judgment was affected negatively \nwhen he drank alcohol. He said his return to alcohol use in August 2007 was an isolated \nincident. (Item 9 at 2-4.) \n \n \nIn his October 15, 2009 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported \nthat he had not drunk alcohol since August 2007. He also stated that he attended AA \nmeetings \u201calmost every day,\u201d had an AA sponsor, and was involved in his church. \nApplicant also provided a copy of his 2008 performance evaluation. The performance \nevaluation reflected that he was a valued employee who carried out his assignments \nand met his employer\u2019s expectations. (Item 9 at 7-15.)    \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has filed for bankruptcy \nprotection three times. In February 1995, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; his debts \nwere discharged in bankruptcy in May 1995. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) Seven years later, in March \n2002, Applicant filed again for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and that bankruptcy \nwas discharged in July 2002. (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) In April 2008, Applicant and his wife filed for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection; and that bankruptcy case was closed in January \n2010. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.) The SOR also alleges that Applicant is responsible for delinquent \nstudent loan debts totaling approximately $22,313. (SOR \u00b6 2.d.) Applicant admitted the \nthree bankruptcies but denied the student loan delinquencies.  (Item 1; Item 4; Item 11; \nItem 12.) \n \n \nIn a July 2008, interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant stated that he filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy because his wife incurred large balances on her eight credit \ncards, and, because she had a low income, they were unable to pay the credit card \ndebts. He stated he was paying the bankruptcy trustee $612 a month and would \ncontinue these monthly payments for five years. Applicant took an on-line course in \ncredit counseling before filing for bankruptcy. (Item 9.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy documents establish that Applicant\u2019s petition \nfor bankruptcy was confirmed in July 2008. He reported assets of $160,397 and \nliabilities of $221,690. His total non-priority unsecured debt was $70,909. He proposed \nto pay the trustee $685 a month for 60 months, for a total of $41,100. The payment plan \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nwas modified in June 2009 to reflect five monthly payments of $175 to the trustee, \nbeginning July 1, 2009, and thereafter $275 a month for 41 months for a new plan base \namount of $21,740. The modification was sought to cure plan arrears to the trustee, to \nmodify treatment for home mortgage and automobile secured claims after Applicant\u2019s \nsurrender of collateral with no further payments due, and to reflect changed income and \nexpenses. (Item 11.)    \n \n \nOn December 7, 2009, the trustee submitted a final report and account. He \nreported $10,042 paid by or on behalf of the debtor. Of that amount, $2,772.61 was \nidentified as expenses of administration, and $7,269.39 was disbursed to creditors. On \nJanuary 14, 2010, a United States bankruptcy judge signed an order discharging the \nstanding trustee, terminating further liability on bond, and closing Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 \ncase. (Item 11.) \n \n \nApplicant reported a gross monthly income of $7,078.40 and payroll deductions \nof $1,867.86, for a net monthly income of $5,210.54. His wife reported $700 in monthly \nincome. Together, Applicant and his wife reported a net monthly income of $5,910.54. \n(Item 11.) \n \n \nApplicant reported the following monthly expenses: rent or home mortgage4, \n$1,040; electricity and heating oil, $200; water and sewer, $90; cell phone, internet, and \ncable, $350; food, $350, clothing, $75; laundry and dry cleaning, $150; medical and \ndental expenses, $200; recreation, clubs and entertainment, newspapers, magazines, \n$400; automobile, $90; alimony, maintenance, and support paid to others, $1,100; and \nattorney fees, $1,000. His net monthly remainder is $165.54. (Item 11.)   \n \n \nApplicant filed a response to the FORM dated August 23, 2010. He denied that \nhis student loans were in delinquent status. He stated that he was paying his student \nloans through his Chapter 13 payment plan. He provided a document showing that his \nstudent loans totaled $26,018 and entered repayment status in September 1994. As of \nJuly 31, 2010, Applicant owed an outstanding principal student loan balance of $22,308 \nand an outstanding interest balance of $3,670.5 (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM at 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s documentation established that his student loans were in repayment \nstatus as of September 15, 1994; in forbearance status as of October 7, 2003; in \nrepayment status as of May 19, 2004; in forbearance status as of July 20, 2007; in \nrepayment status as of February 19, 2008; and stayed by his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nfiling, active as of May 30, 2008. Applicant\u2019s documentation does not establish that \npayments were made on his student loans by the bankruptcy trustee. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to FORM at 2; Item 11; Item 12.) \n \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s wife reported that she paid $700 each month in rent or in a mortgage payment. (Item 11.) \n \n5 The document provided by Applicant contained small print which was difficult to read, which may \nexplain why the outstanding principal balance and the outstanding interest balance do not appear to \nequal the total student loan amount. (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM at 2.)  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nIn his August 23, 2010 response to the FORM, Applicant stated:  \n \nAll of my financial problems have been brought forward from my wife \ngetting credit cards in her name without telling me and other items. This \ncaused me to file bankruptcy twice. To resolve this situation, I have \ndivorced her. I am up to date with my chapter 13 and I always paid my \ncredit debts, it was all of her credit cards. My credit reports will show this. \n \n(Response to FORM at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant provided for the record a copy of a judicial order granting him a divorce \nfrom his wife. The order is dated May 4, 2010. (Response to FORM at 3.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risks of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n The following conditions could raise disqualifying security concerns under \u00b6 22 \nof the alcohol consumption adjudicative guideline: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22. Applicant   \nconsumed alcohol to excess and at times to intoxication from 1996 to at least August \n2007. In 1996, he was arrested, charged, and found guilty of DUI. From February 1997 \nuntil May 1997, he was treated in an alcohol treatment program for a condition \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependence. After completing the treatment program, he \ncontinued to consume alcohol, and in January 2000, he was arrested and found guilty of \ndriving while having a blood alcohol level of .08% or higher. In August 2007, he \nconsumed alcohol with family members for a week, and when he realized he could not \nstop drinking alcohol on his own, he sought admission to a hospital for treatment. Upon \nadmission, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and treated. Later, he continued his \ntreatment for alcohol dependence at the hospital from December 2007 until January \n2008. Additionally, he was under psychiatric care and treated for his alcohol \ndependence from September 2007 until at least May 2009. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \n22(c), 22(d), and 22(f) apply to the facts in this case.  \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23(d) if \u201cthe individual has \nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with \nany required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \n\n \n10 \n \n \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has \nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d \n \n \n \nApplicant was found guilty of a DUI in 1996. He was diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent in 1997 and completed outpatient treatment. He continued to consume \nalcohol, and three years after completing his outpatient treatment, he was arrested and \nfound guilty of driving with a .08% or above blood-alcohol level. His letter of November \n11, 2004, in response to the FORM he was sent by DOHA in October 2004, suggests \nthat he continued to consume alcohol until at least February and March 2002, when his \nwife and step-children confronted him about his drinking problem.  \n \n \nAfter this confrontation, Applicant, to his credit, sought help for his alcohol \ndependence. He joined AA, obtained a sponsor, and became active in a church. He \nbecame involved in the life of his family. In light of his apparent rehabilitation, he was \ngranted a security clearance.  \n \n \n However, three years later, Applicant felt stress while visiting his parents, both of \nwhom were seriously ill, and he drank alcohol every day for a week. He again sought \nand received treatment for his alcohol dependence. He is again in AA, has a sponsor, \nand seeks to permanently abstain from alcohol use. He claims he has not used alcohol \nsince August 2007. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s excessive use of alcohol spans a period of at least eleven years and \nis habitual. He acknowledged that his alcohol use impairs his judgment while it also \nrelieves his stress. Twice, after treatment for alcohol dependence, Applicant returned to \nthe use of alcohol. His relapses have occurred at intervals of about three years, despite \nhis active participation in AA, making the possibility of future alcohol use likely at this \ntime. Under these circumstances, I conclude that insufficient time as passed to \ndemonstrate that Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol is unlikely to recur. I conclude that none of \nthe Guideline G mitigating conditions fully applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe Guideline F security concern is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns in this \ncase. Under AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \n\n \n11 \n \n \ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. AG \u00b6 19(f) reads: \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to \ndrug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues of security concern.\u201d \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency. In his alcohol treatment, he \nstated that his drinking resulted in financial problems and compulsive spending. In 1995, \n2002, and 2008, Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his creditors and satisfy his financial \nobligations led him to seek protection from his creditors through bankruptcy. With his \nfirst Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant received a fresh start in his financial life, \nand there was the possibility that he would acquire financial discipline and avoid the \nfinancial overextension that caused his debts to overwhelm him. However, this did not \nhappen, and by 2002, Applicant again had so many debts that he filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy again. Six years later, in 2008, Applicant\u2019s repeated indebtedness led him to \nfile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. After three bankruptcies, he failed to satisfy the student \nloans he incurred in 1994. From 1998 to the present, Applicant had steady and lucrative \nemployment with one employer. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to \nthe facts in Applicant\u2019s case.    \n \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions could apply to the \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial \ndelinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(a)). \nAdditionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, \nor separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 \n20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence \nthat \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \n\u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  Finally, security concerns related to financial \ndelinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n   \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 1995. \nDespite resolving some of his debts through Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and despite a \ngross annual salary of approximately $84,000, he continues to owe over $22,313, plus \ninterest, in student loans which he incurred in 1994. His delinquencies are recent and \non-going. They have occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur.  \n \nApplicant has been steadily employed with his current employer since 1998. He \nstated that his financial delinquencies resulted from his wife\u2019s spendthrift behavior, but \n\n \n12 \n \n \nhe failed to provide documentation to establish that his wife, and not he, was \nresponsible for the debts that led to his 2002 and 2008 bankruptcies. The record does \nnot support a conclusion that his failure to satisfy his creditors is the result of \ncircumstances beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s financial counseling was limited to an on-\nline course he took before filing for his most recent bankruptcy. His net monthly \nremainder is $165, suggesting that an unexpected expense could cause him to fall \nbehind.  \n \nIn determining an individual's security worthiness, the Government may consider \nhis or her financial history. The discharge or partial resolution of an applicant\u2019s debts in \nbankruptcy \u201cdoes not immunize the applicant\u2019s history of financial problems from \nscrutiny for its security significance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 98-0156 at 2 (App. Bd. November \n12, 1998.) Applicant\u2019s reliance upon consecutive bankruptcies as a tool for resolving \nfinancial delinquency raises concerns about his trustworthiness and reliability. I \nconclude that none of the financial considerations mitigating conditions fully applies to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has battled alcohol \ndependence for many years. Unfortunately, he relapsed after participating in two alcohol \ntreatment programs, thereby causing security concerns about his ability to protect \nclassified information. Insufficient time has elapsed since his last relapse to conclude \nthat he can abstain from alcohol use in the future. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies which arose in part from his \nexcessive use of alcohol. He blamed his second wife for the financial delinquencies that \n\n \n13 \n \n \ncaused him to petition for bankruptcy in 2002 and 2008, and he provided documentation \nto show that he had divorced his second wife in May 2010. He failed to establish that \nthe financial delinquencies were primarily the consequence of his wife\u2019s actions. \nMoreover, he provided no documentation to show a plan to pay his debts and remain \nsolvent in the future. After three bankruptcies in 13 years, Applicant must establish a \ntrack record of financial responsibility before the Government can have confidence in \nhis judgment and reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:                     Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b(1) - 1.b(4): \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. - 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n                                              Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 10, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn October 8, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on December 1, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n2, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 17, 2010. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 10, which were entered into evidence without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were\nalso admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nMarch 30, 2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 31,\n2010, to submit additional documents, Applicant timely submitted three additional\ndocuments, which have been identified and entered into evidence without objections as\n\n2\nExhibit G. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony\nof Applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 24 years old. He is not currently married, but he is engaged to be\nmarried, and he and his fiancee are expecting their first child. Applicant served in the\nUnited States Air Force from November 2003 to November 2007, and he received an\nHonorable Discharge. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant is alleged to have \u201cconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to\nthe point of intoxication, from approximately 2004 to at least 2009.\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he first consumed alcohol at the age of 19,\nwhen he was in technical training in the Air Force in 2004, after high school. He started\nout drinking about two weekends each month, three or four drinks at a time.  He then\nincreased his consumption of alcohol to one time each weekend, three to five drinks per\noccasion. This pattern of alcohol consumption continued until May 2006, when the\nincident that is the subject of 1.b., below occurred. (Tr at 43-49.)\nSince May of 2008, after he began his current employment and he became\nengaged, his alcohol consumption has been significantly reduced. He now consumes\none beer on Thursday with his coworkers, as a company tradition, and he also has two\nor three beers, once a month. (Tr at 76-79.) He testified that he now takes classes at a\ncollege and coaches a high school wrestling team, and with a baby on the way, he does\nnot want to go back to his old way of life. (Tr at 79-82.)\n1.b. In May 2006, Applicant received a Non-Judicial Punishment under Article 15\nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for Consuming Alcohol Beverages While\nUnderage, being Drunk and Disorderly and Making Unwanted Sexual Advances. He\nreceived punishment consisting of forfeiture of pay, reduction in grade, being restricted\nto base and being required to perform extra duty. \nApplicant testified that this incident initially occurred when he was at a party with\nhis co-workers, including a young woman who was a friend of his and in the same\nSquadron as he. With her permission, he stayed in her room for the night. He averred\nthat they kissed for a period of time, and after consuming \u201ca little too much\u201d alcohol he\npassed out. When he woke up, she gave him a ride back to his dorm, and everything\n\n3\nseemed alright to him. He even spent some time with her the next night in her room,\nand there did not seem to be any problem. Approximately two weeks later, when he was\non leave, he became aware of her allegations that he that he made unwanted sexual\nadvances to her. He was also accused of drinking alcohol, when he was under the legal\nage limit, and he conceded that this allegation was correct.  After the incident he had no\nfurther contact with the woman. He testified that after three months his reduction of\ngrade was mitigated and reversed. Applicant conceded that after the 30 days\npunishment, he began consuming more alcohol every weekend, for four or five months.\n(Tr at 49-55.)\n1.c. In January 2007, Applicant received a Non-Judicial Punishment under Article\n15 of the UCMJ for Assault, being Drunk and Disorderly, and Using Provoking Words.\nHe received punishment consisting of forfeiture of pay, reduction in grade, and he was\nordered to attend an alcohol awareness program. \nApplicant testified that this incident occurred when he was at an enlisted bar with\nfour of his friends. All of them had consumed alcohol, and he estimated that he had\nconsumed one pitcher of beer and two mixed drinks, and he was \u201ca little intoxicated.\u201d  A\nfight ensued among some of the friends, and he became involved to defend one of his\nfriends from another friend. Eventually the incident ended, and he went back to his\nroom. He was thereafter confronted by security officers, and he gave a statement of\nwhat transpired. He stated that by the next night all of the friends were together at the\nsame bar. (Tr at 55-60.)\n1.d. Because of the incidents listed as 1.b. and 1.c., above, Applicant was\nordered to attend an alcohol awareness program. He received treatment from April\n2006 to August 2007, for a condition that was diagnosed as Alcohol Abuse.  Applicant\nattended two meetings a week during the period of his treatment, and he averred that\nhe never missed a scheduled meeting, and he completed the program. He abstained\nfrom alcohol consumption during his treatment period. (Tr at 60-64.) Exhibit 5 consists\nof the records from the treatment facility. In the final treatment page, dated September\n4, 2007, his supervisor indicated that his goals were met, and he was an \u201cExcellent\nPerformer. Consistently produces high quality work.\u201d\n1.e. In December 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Felony\nGrand Theft, (2) Receiving Stolen Property, (3) Resisting Arrest, and (4) Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI). Applicant had consumed alcohol prior to the arrest.\nApplicant testified that this incident, which occurred after he had been discharged\nfrom the Air Force, happened when he and his friends had been coming home from a\nbar. His friend was driving and Applicant was asleep in the passenger seat. Another\nfriend was also asleep in the back seat. Their vehicle was struck from the rear and\nwhen the police arrived they arrested the driver of the other vehicle and the driver of the\nvehicle in which Applicant was riding, both for DWI. \nApplicant explained that after his friend was arrested, and the vehicle was going\nto be impounded, he attempted to take some of the items of his friend from the car. He\nwas accused of handling stolen property, and Applicant conceded that rather than go\n\n4\nback to the station and explain the situation to the police, he began arguing in a\nbelligerent manner. (Tr at 64-75.)\nOn May 16, 2008, Applicant plead Nolo Contendere to Count 3  Resisting Arrest,\nand he was convicted. He was sentenced to perform 45 days of community service and\nthree years of summary probation, which has not yet been completed.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts:\n2.a.  The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under paragraph\n1.b. through 1.e., above, constitutes criminal actions. At the hearing, the SOR was\namended so that SOR allegation 1.d. was removed from this paragraph. The amended\nSOR now alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under subparagraphs 1.b.,\n1.c, and 1.e., above, constitutes criminal actions. \nMitigation\nAs stated above, Applicant introduced three post hearing documents. (Exhibit G.)\nThe first is a letter, dated March 31, 2010, from a Ph.D., who is the mental health\nprofessional for Applicant\u2019s current employer and a state licensed psychotherapist.   He\nstated that he performed a mental health assessment of Applicant, and he found,\n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s] use at present is 1-2 beers over the course of a two week period. No\nGeneral symptoms, no physical symptoms, no behavioral symptoms . . . No indication\nof chemical dependency or abuse apparent. No reason to refer client for evaluation or\ncare.\u201d\nApplicant also submitted an evaluation from his current employer, dated April 21,\n2009. (Exhibit E.) Applicant received Outstanding or Exceeds Performance\nRequirements in each of 10 categories. It was stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cmilitary training\nand your ability to work with others makes you a great addition to the 2  shift\nnd\norganization. You are always looking ahead and completing tasks assigned. Keep up\nthe good work!\u201d            \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in two Non-Judicial Punishments\nunder Article 15 of the UCMJ, and one arrest and Nolo Contendere plea for resisting\narrest. The Government has established that Applicant was involved in \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work,\u201d and binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgement.\u201d Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 22(a) and (c) apply to this case.  \nAs stated above, Applicant has drastically reduced his consumption of alcoholic\nbeverages, and he has received an evaluation from a licensed clinical psychologist that\nthere is \u201cNo indication of chemical dependency or abuse apparent.\u201d As a result of this, I\nfind that Mitigating Conditition \u00b6 23(b) \u201cthe individual acknowledges his alcoholism or\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser)\u201d applies. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.\n\n6\nParagraph 2 Guideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, by\nhis acts that are listed under paragraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e. I find that \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d applies in this case. \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged,\u201d is also applicable to this case. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol, which was the underlying cause of\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct, has been greatly reduced, I find Mitigating Condition under\n\u00b6 32(d) is applicable. There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the sincere remorse of Applicant, which I base on Applicant\u2019s testimony, and\nhis good employment record. Additionally, Applicant is now involved in improving his life\nby taking classes, coaching a high school wrestling team, and preparing for marriage\nand fatherhood, Applicant\u2019s criminal activity has been mitigated. Paragraph 2, Guideline\nJ is found for Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply, considered with all the steps Applicant\nhas taken to improve his life, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. -1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Sysko, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  Applicant\u2019s clearance is denied.\n1\nOn 19 June 2009 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nG, Alcohol Consumption, H, Drug Involvement, J, Criminal Conduct, and F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n2\nassigned the case to me 28 August 2009, and I convened a hearing 6 October 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript 14 October 2009.\nOctober 13, 2010\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.h, 3.a, and 4.a. He is a\n48-year-old network administrator employed by a defense contractor since March 2003.\nHe served on active duty for over 20 years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a Technical\nSergeant (paygrade E-6). He seeks to retain the clearance he obtained in the Air Force\nin 1992, and transferred to his civilian employment when he retired.\nApplicant grew up in a dysfunctional family, and began drinking when he was 13\nor 14 years old. An older sister died from an aneurism that was related to her drug\nabuse. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by four alcohol-\nrelated incidents between May 1984 and June 2000, and culminating in his first\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence in April 2001.\nIn May 1984, Applicant was arrested for DUI (>.10% BAC) and later convicted.\nBecause of this arrest, he was referred for a military evaluation, which concluded that\nApplicant was a problem drinker who was in the early/middle stages of alcoholism, and\nrecommended him for a rehabilitation program. However, he was not sent to the\nprogram.\nIn June 1991, Applicant was again arrested, and later convicted, for DWI. He\npaid a fine. In November 1998, he was arrested for DWI (.12% BAC) and later\nconvicted. The pertinent part of his sentence was five year\u2019s probation and an order to\nattend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). His final DWI (.13% BAC) was June 2000. His\nJanuary 2001 sentence for that conviction included jail time and another year\u2019s\nprobation\nBecause of his June 2000 arrest, Applicant received alcohol treatment from\nOctober 2000 to April 2001. The evaluator was a Certified Associate Counselor Alcohol\nand Drug (CAC\u2013AD), the designation of his state licensing board. Applicant was ordered\nto treatment by the judicial system. Applicant abstained from alcohol while in treatment,\nand had six negative urinalyses during the program. He resolved his legal problem,\ngained a working knowledge of alcohol dependency, and developed a support system\nfor ongoing recovery. The narrative summary noted:\nIt appears that this client is taking his Alcohol Dependency very seriously\nand is willing to take the necessary steps to treat his Alcohol Dependency\non a daily basis. It is this counselor\u2019s impression that his client has\naccepted that he is Alcohol Dependent. (GE  2)\nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, told to abstain from alcohol,\nattend at least two AA meetings per week for two years, and continue to use his support\nsystem to fully understand the 12-step AA program for ongoing recovery. His prognosis\nwas good, provided he followed his continuing care plan.\n\n\u00b6 22. (d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\n3\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program;\nThe evaluation contained in both GE 2 and 3 is dated 01/15/05 at the beginning of the evaluation and\n4\n01/15/04 at the end of the evaluation\u2014which I consider a typographical error for two reasons. First, Applicant\ngot the evaluation because of DOHA\u2019s December 2004 requirement. He could not have gotten the evaluation\nin January 2004. Second, the counselor who made the evaluation also executed the interrogatories which\nwere hand-dated 15 January 2005 by Applicant when he submitted them to DOHA.\n\u00b6 E3.1.17. The SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her own motion,\n5\nor upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence\nadmitted or for other good cause. W hen such amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant\neither party's request for such additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate for further\npreparation or other good cause.\n3\nOn 22 December 2004 DOHA required Applicant to get a current medical\nprognosis concerning his resumption of alcohol following treatment (GE 2). The\nevaluation was to be performed by a treatment professional within the meaning of AG \u00b6\n22. (d) and (e),  and include consideration of Applicant\u2019s answers to other questions in\n3\nthe interrogatories. Applicant went to the same counselor who treated him in 2000-\n2001, and got an evaluation dated 15 January 2005.  There is conflicting evidence on\n4\nwhat the evaluation consisted of. At the hearing, Department Counsel proffered that\nbased on representations by Applicant and his counsel, the evaluation\u2014although dated\n15 January 2005\u2014reflected only Applicant\u2019s program participation in 2000-2001,\nrendering SOR 1. h moot. Based on those representations, SOR 1.h was stricken (Tr.\n16-17). However, at the conclusion of Applicant\u2019s testimony (Tr. 95-93), I reinstated the\nallegation in accordance with \u00b6 E.3.1.17 of the additional procedural guidance\n(Directive, Enclosure 3).  Neither party requested additional time to address the\n5\nallegation, and both declined  the opportunity to further question Applicant (Tr. 93).\nContrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, the 15 January 2005 evaluation shows that it\nwas based on a detailed reevaluation of Applicant on that date. The evaluation correctly\nstates that Applicant had to get an evaluation for his security clearance processing. The\nevaluation records the tests and techniques used by the counselor, the test results, and\nthe interpretation of the test results\u2014items missing from the April 2001 evaluation. The\ncounselor concluded that Applicant was alcohol dependent (early stage), but had\nexcellent knowledge about alcohol dependency. He recommended no treatment, and\nstated that Applicant was medically and mentally fit to perform his job duties. However,\nhe noted that Applicant had test results:\n . . . that are consistent with the scores of an individual who\nis Alcohol Dependent, which (sic) has an excellent\nknowledge of Alcohol Dependency. His verbal responses,\nhis self reported Drinking History (sic) tends to support this\nfinding.\n\n4\nThe counselor emphasized that \u201c[e]ach component of this evaluation was discussed\nwith [Applicant] in detail. [Applicant] is aware that he needs to address his Alcohol\nDependency on a daily basis.\u201d\nApplicant no longer drinks and drives, and he does not go out to drink. He\nestimates that he drinks two glasses of wine with dinner 3-4 times per week, and maybe\na few beers per month. He has had no alcohol-related incidents since 2000.\nApplicant states that the counselor did not conduct an interview in January 2005\nor give him any tests (Tr. 72). He says their meeting was only to get the counselor to\nconfirm his treatment in 2000-2001. He admits that the counselor told him he was\nalcohol dependent in 2001, and recommended that he use the AA 12-step program. He\ninsists that he was told to abstain from alcohol only during his treatment. He last went to\nan AA meeting in 2003 and cannot recite any of the 12 steps. When he went to AA,\nsometimes he thought he was an alcoholic, and sometimes not. He does not think he is\nan alcoholic now, but admits he had an alcohol problem in 2000. He admits it was\nimportant for his criminal case and his job for him to get a favorable evaluation from the\ncounselor in April 2001 (Tr. 75).\nOn 21 August 2009, Applicant consulted a Licensed Clinical Professional\nCounselor (LCPC) for \u201can alcohol assessment and evaluation for security purposes for\nhis job.\u201d (AE B) The counselor interviewed him for about 1\u00bd hours, but performed no\ntests. Applicant told her that he had been treated for alcoholism, but had not had a drink\nin public for many years, although he occasionally drank wine spritzers in his home. She\ndid not render a diagnosis or prognosis, but stated he was fully capable of performing\nhis job duties. However, she recommended he get a second opinion.\nApplicant got the second opinion in September 2009, when he consulted a\nLicensed Clinical Alcohol and Drug Counselor (AE C). The counselor directs a program\nthat has been approved by several state agencies and courts. The counselor examined\nApplicant and concluded:\n[a]fter an in-depth interview, a psycho-social assessment,\ncortical function test, and [state] Addictions Questionnaire, it\nis my belief that [Applicant] does not have a problem with\ndrugs and/or alcohol. Therefore, I feel that neither an\neducational program not treatment program is necessary at\nthis time.\nHowever, the counselor did not otherwise explain the basis for his opinions, specifically\nin light of Applicant\u2019s resumption of alcohol after treatment and diagnosis as alcohol\ndependent. The record is silent on any scope of practice limitations concomitant with\nlicensing as a CAC-AD, LCPC, or LCADC.\nApplicant used marijuana one time in 1999, when he held a clearance. Applicant\nalso failed to report rental income on his income tax returns from April 2000 to May\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n5\n2002. He bought a house in 2000. A friend needed a place to stay, and Applicant\nobliged him. The friend lived on and off with Applicant for about two years and paid him\nrent sporadically. Applicant did not know he had to claim those payments as income.\nWhen he found out he had to claim the income, he submitted amended tax returns and\npaid the additional tax, penalties, and interest (AE D, E).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and coworker consider him an excellent employee, who is\nhonest and trustworthy. He has good evaluations (AE F). Both witnesses are somewhat\naware of Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues, but neither is aware of the full extent. They have\nnot observed him under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, punctuated by four alcohol-related\narrests between May 1984 and June 2000, his subsequent diagnoses of alcohol\n\n\u00b622.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n7\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; . . . (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who\nis a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; (f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\n\u00b623.(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\n8\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b623.(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\n9\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent)\nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\u00b623.(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has\n10\nno history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n6\ndependence in April 2001 and January 2005, and discontinuing his recovery program\nand abstinence after his 2001 release from his rehabilitation program.  Applicant failed\n7\nto fully mitigate the security concerns.\nThe mitigating conditions under Guideline G provide incomplete amelioration of\nthe security concerns. Although his alcohol abuse was not recent, as measured by\nalcohol-related incidents, it was frequent, and not under unusual circumstances.8\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his alcohol abuse is limited to the period 1984-2000. He\nviews the problem as limited to his drinking and driving; thus the only action he took to\novercome the problem was drinking only at home. Arguably, he has established a\npattern of responsible use, but this only applies to a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. \nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2001, and he has not\nestablished a pattern of abstinence.  His claim that he was to abstain from alcohol only\n9\nwhile in the rehabilitation program is simply unbelievable, as is his claim that he did not\nundergo a full evaluation in January 2005, an evaluation which confirmed his diagnosis\nof alcohol dependence. Applicant stopped going to AA in 2003, and has no other\nsupport system in place. Without some kind of program, his demonstration of\nresponsible drinking is insufficient where abstinence is the standard.  Finally, Applicant\n10\nreturned to drinking after he completed his treatment program in 2001, a circumstance\nthat led to his being again diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2005. His 2009\nevaluations do little to refute that diagnosis.\nApplicant completed a rehabilitation program in 2001, but returned to drinking\nand stopped going to AA, contrary to treatment recommendations. His 2001 prognosis\nwas good, but conditioned on his continued adherence to his recovery program. His\n2009 evaluations note only that Applicant does not currently demonstrate any alcohol\nproblem. But neither of them reconciles this finding with the earlier diagnoses of alcohol\ndependence, neither of them addresses their findings in the context of Applicant\u2019s\n\n\u00b623.(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\n11\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, . . . and has received a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ;\n12\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n13\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n14\nof abstinence;\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n15\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n7\nresumed alcohol consumption, and neither of them contains a prognosis for Applicant.11\nWithout a prognosis, Applicant\u2019s drinking at home limits the likelihood that he will drink\nand drive, but does not vitiate the security concerns that Applicant\u2019s drinking will evolve\nto abusive drinking again. Put another way, once Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent and resumed drinking contrary to treatment recommendations, he had the\nburden of establishing that the diagnosis of alcohol dependence was no longer valid and\nthat his current alcohol consumption presented no security concerns despite the earlier\ndiagnosis. Applicant\u2019s 2009 evaluations fail to meet that burden. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline G against Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H.12\nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Although Applicant\u2019s drug abuse\noccurred when he had a clearance, the remoteness and infrequency of use, the\ncircumstances of that use, and 18 years abstinence from drug use, suggest he is\nunlikely to use drugs in the future.  With no indication of any psychological or physical\n13\ndependence on drugs, his 18 year abstinence from drug use is adequate to\ndemonstrate an intent to refrain from drug use in the future.  I conclude Applicant is\n14\nunlikely to use illegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for\nApplicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by\nestablishing Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal conduct and his illegal use of drugs.15\nHowever, the gravamen of the security concerns in this case revolve around Applicant\u2019s\nalcohol abuse issues. Separate allegation of the criminal nature of his conduct, whether\nalcohol abuse or drug abuse, adds nothing of substance to the analysis of Applicant\u2019s\nfitness for access to classified information. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline F.\nApplicant\u2019s not knowing that the sporadic \u201crent\u201d payments made to him by the friend\nwho lived with him occasionally was income, and thus not declaring those payments as\n\n8\nincome on his tax returns, does not demonstrate poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or\nunreliability. Once he knew it was income, he amended his tax returns and paid the\namounts due. Further, the additional taxes, penalties, and interest imposed did not\ncreate any financial difficulty for Applicant. I resolve Guideline F for Applicant.\nIn my whole-person evaluation of Applicant, I have given particular consideration\nto his 20 years honorable military service, his favorable work and character references,\nand the favorable conclusions of his 2009 alcohol evaluations. However, I find those\nfactors insufficient to overcome the adverse inferences attendant to his resumption of\nalcohol after his diagnoses of alcohol dependence.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 2.a. He denied 1.e., 1.f., and parts of 2.b. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: Applicant is 61 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He received a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. He indicated that he plans to retire in March 2011, but he is considering working on a casual basis after his retirement. (Tr at 21-22.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that is either criminal, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may subject an individual to undue influence or coercion. 1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant solicited sex from prostitutes from about the 1970s to at least 1990. As reviewed above, Applicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Joseph Testan, Esquire,\nMay 10, 2011\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn June  23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines D and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nOn August 18, 2010, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was initially assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 28, 2010,\nand the hearing was scheduled for November 16, 2010. Because of scheduling conflict,\na second notice of hearing was issued on November 8, 2010, and the hearing was held,\nas scheduled for December 16, 2010. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on December 7, 2010. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received and entered\ninto evidence without objection without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Exhibits A through D at the time of hearing, which were also entered into\nevidence without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nJanuary 3, 2011, to submit additional evidence.  I received a one page character letter,\nidentified as Exhibit E, and entered into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on December 29, 2010. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 2.a.\nHe denied 1.e., 1.f., and parts of 2.b. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 61 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He received a\nBachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering. Applicant is employed by a defense\ncontractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in\nthe defense sector. He indicated that he plans to retire in March 2011, but he is\nconsidering working on a casual basis after his retirement. (Tr at 21-22.)\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that is either criminal, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may\nsubject an individual to undue influence or coercion.  \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant solicited sex from prostitutes from\nabout the 1970s to at least 1990.  As reviewed above, Applicant admitted this allegation\nin his RSOR. At the hearing, Applicant estimated that his last solicitation of a prostitute\nwas between three and five years ago. (Tr at 22.) He estimated that he has solicited a\nprostitute between 100 and 200 times, and continued to do this even during his period\nof attending a 12 step sexual recovery program. He testified that his solicitation has\ngradually decreased over the years, and, \u201cIt has really gotten quite rare these days.\u201d (Tr\nat 41-42, 58.) \n1.b. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant engaged in illegal activity of a sexual\nnature, to include exhibitionism, voyeurism, unauthorized touching, and masturbation\nfrom about the 1970s to at least 1990. Applicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR.\nDuring Applicant\u2019s testimony, it was clarified by his attorney that the allegation of\n\n3\nmasturbation referred to Applicant masturbating in public. He estimated that he last\nengaged in the conduct listed in this subparagraph between five and 10 years ago. (Tr\nat 22-23.) He also estimated that he engaged in public masturbation \u201ca couple of\nhundred times.\u201d (Tr at 55.)\n1.c. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant was arrested in about 1990 and\ncharged with Solicitation of a Prostitute.  He was found guilty and placed on probation.\nApplicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR.\n1.d. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant was arrested in about 1991 and\ncharged with (1) Indecent Exposure, and (2) Making False Statement to the Police. He\npled guilty to Disturbing the Peace and was fined and placed on three years probation.\nApplicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR and confirmed it during his testimony. (Tr\nat 23-24.) This arrest occurred as a result of Applicant masturbating in his vehicle, and a\nwoman claiming that he was engaged in indecent exposure. (Tr at 43.) \n1.e. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant possessed child pornography prior to\n1999. Applicant denied this allegation in his RSOR. Applicant testified that he denied\nthis allegation because he had \u201cold nudist magazines\u201d that included people of all ages,\nincluding children who were nude, but no sexual activity was depicted. He also testified\nthat he had never had an interest in child pornography, and he had not obtained these\nmagazines with the purpose of viewing underage people in sexual positions.  (Tr at 24-\n25, 45.) \n1.f. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant utilizes the services of a massage\nparlor that offers the additional services of a sexual nature three to four times a year.\nApplicant denied this allegation in his RSOR. Applicant testified that he denied this\nallegation, which was based upon a statement he made, Exhibit 3, because his \u201cslips,\u201d\nas he described them, involved different forms of breaking the definitions of abstinence\nfrom his sexual recovery program called Sex Addicts Anonymous. (Tr at 58.) These\nincluded more than massage parlor visits alone; they also included going to sexual\nvideo arcades, getting lap dances at a strip club, or going to a hostess dance club. All of\nthese activities were included in his \u201cslips.\u201d (Tr at 27-30.)\nApplicant made the distinction between acts that may not be illegal, such as\ngoing to sexual video arcades, getting lap dances at a strip club, or going to a hostess\ndance club, but they were not allowed on his 12 step program, so by engaging in these\nactivities he violated the tenets of his sexual recovery program. This would be similar to\na member of alcoholics anonymous  who consumes alcohol.\nApplicant testified that he had not frequented massage parlors within the last\nyear before the hearing, but upon reflection, he did concede that he did go to a\nmassage parlor in March 2010. (Tr at 26-30.) This massage included sexual\ngratification. Applicant first testified he was not seeking this service, but when it was\noffered, he could not refuse because he could not control his compulsion.(Tr at 47, 49.)\nUpon further examination, Applicant conceded that he had anticipated this massage\nmay include sexual activity, and even though he was aware that he was being\n\n4\ninvestigated as part of his security clearance application, he could not overcome his\naddiction. (Tr at 60-63.) He also received a lap dance at around the same time frame. \nApplicant testified that he considers himself a sexual addict. He began a 12 step\nprogram for sexual addicts in 1990, which he continues to attend weekly. He believes\nthe program has helped him with his addiction. He stated that his sexual behavior has\ndiminished over the years because of this program and also as he has aged he is less\ninclined to engage in this conduct. He and his wife also have been attending a 12 step\nsexual addict program for couples during the past 16 years. He plans to continue\nattending both programs and does not plan to engage in the sexual conduct that is the\nsubject of this case in the future.  (Tr at 31-35, 67.) \nApplicant testified that his wife is aware of his sexual activity, and I note that she\nwas present at the hearing and heard all of the testimony. He estimated that three\npeople at his place of employment are also aware of his sexual conduct. (Tr at 35-36.)\nApplicant does supervise three employees, and he testified that none of them was\naware of his sexual conduct. (Tr at 51.) He also testified that his two children, who are\n22 and 17, his three brothers, and his one sister are not aware of the full extent of\nsexual conduct, although they are aware that he attends a 12 step program. (Tr at 53.)\nHe indicated that if someone threatened to inform his children of his sexual activities, he\nwould inform the authorities. (Tr at 56.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he engaged in conduct that exhibited questionable judgement,\nunreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and untrustworthiness.  \n         2.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant was denied program access by another\nGovernment agency in about April 1999 due to criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and\npersonal conduct. Applicant admitted this allegation in his RSOR.\n2.b. It is alleged in the SOR Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1,\nabove, constitutes the kind of behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it\nexhibits questionable judgement, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nand untrustworthiness.  Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., above.\nMitigation\nApplicant introduced a document titled \u201c\u201dIntent to Retire On\u201d which indicated that\nhe notified his employer that he planned to retire on March 1, 2011. (Exhibit A.) \nHe also introduced a letter from a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, dated\nDecember 13, 2010, who met with Applicant on three occasions. (Exhibit B.) She\nreviewed the information that he provided to her and wrote, \u201cIt is also my professional\nassessment, based on three interviews with [Applicant] that he is unlikely to commit any\nillegal sexual behavior. He has shown an ongoing commitment to his sexual recovery\n\n5\nand he and his wife are both active in working with other couples as part of their own\nrecovery.\u201d In reviewing this report, including Applicant\u2019s history, I note there is no\nmention of Applicant receiving the sexual massage or the lap dance in 2010, nor is\nthere any discussion about Applicant\u2019s amount of solicitation of prostitution (100 to 200\ntimes) or his public masturbation (200 times), so I do not know if this therapist was\naware of Applicant\u2019s full sexual history. Therefore, I do not give this report a great deal\nof weight. \nApplicant submitted two letters of reference. The first one is from Applicant\u2019s line\nmanager for the past three years, who has known Applicant for almost 20 years. He\nwrote he \u201calways regarded [Applicant] as being reliable and trustworthy, and have never\nencountered any reason to doubt his loyalty or suitability to work on national security\nprograms.\u201d  No mention was made of Applicant\u2019s sexual issues. (Exhibit D.) The second\nletter was from Applicant\u2019s sponsor in Sexual Addicts Anonymous, who has known him\nfor 20 years. He confirmed that Applicant is conscientious in attending the meetings and\nworking the 12 step program. (Exhibit E.) \nApplicant also submitted his performance evaluations signed in 2008 and 2009.\n(Exhibit C.) He received Satisfactory rather than Unsatisfactory for both years regarding\n\u201cSafeguarding of Classified Information\u201d and \u201cMaintaining Safe Work Environment.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n6\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct\nIt has been established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in the\nkind of sexual behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it is criminal conduct,\nand it exhibits a lack of discretion and good judgement.  Applicant engaged in the\nsolicitation of prostitution between 100 and 200 times and public masturbation on 200\noccasions. Even when he was aware that he was being investigated because of his\nsecurity clearance, he engaged in sexual massage and a lap dance in 2010.  While it\nappears that he would like to abstain from this conduct, and the conduct has diminished\nin frequency, when I consider the frequency and longevity of his sexual history and the\nfact that he continues to have \u201cslips\u201d from his sexual 12 step program, I cannot conclude\nthat he has established a pattern of significant sexual abstinence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6  13 (a) \u201csexual behavior that is of criminal nature, whether or not the\nindividual has been prosecuted\u201d applies to the facts of this case. AG \u00b6 13 (d) also\napplies because Applicant \u201cengaged in sexual behavior that reflects lack of discretion or\njudgement.\u201d  No mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 14 can be found to apply here.\nParagraph 1, Guideline D is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant engaged in\nconduct, which considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and a lack of candor. I resolve\nParagraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and no Mitigating Condition is\napplicable regarding Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct over many years. I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\n           Against Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He submitted interrogatory answers (Item 7) concerning delinquent financial\naccounts to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) adjudicators on March 11,\n2009. On June 30, 2009, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns under financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was\ntaken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, dated July 20, 2009, he admitted SOR 1.a.,\n1.b., and 1.d., and denied 1.c. He requested a decision be made on the record in lieu of\na hearing. A copy of the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the\ngovernment\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant\non August 21, 2009. He received the FORM on August 31, 2009. His response was due\non September 30, 2009. No response was received. The case file was assigned to me\non November 9, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 45 years old. He married in August 1995, and has three children.\nAfter unexpectedly learning his wife was having an affair in the spring of 2002, he\nobtained a divorce in January 2003 (Item 2). \nIn May 1996, Applicant received an Associate\u2019s degree in Applied Science (AAS)\n(Item 3). He has been employed as a pilot since 1998 (Id.). He held a Top Secret\nsecurity clearance while on active duty in the United States Army between 1982 and\n1986 (Id.). He seeks a Secret security clearance. \nApplicant has four delinquent debts totaling $29,825. They are listed in his credit\nbureau reports dated July 22, 2008 (Item 7), December 12, 2008 (Item 6), and August\n19, 2009 (Item 5).\n# SOR 1.a. In his answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant acknowledged owing\nthis creditor $3,627. The last date of activity on this account before becoming delinquent\nwas April 2004 (Item 6). Applicant explained that on March 5, 2009, a settlement of\n$2,000 had been worked out with the creditor (Item 4). The settlement would be\nsatisfied after Applicant made a down payment of $545, followed by eight monthly\npayments of 181.88 (Id.). Documentation from the creditor reflects the down payment\nwas made, but no subsequent payments were made to complete the settlement (Id.).\nApplicant still owes the debt.\n# SOR 1.b. Applicant admitted this judgment of $10,005 (Item 2). Before\nbecoming delinquent, the last activity on this account was February 2004, and a\njudgment (based on this account) was entered against Applicant in February 2008 (Item\n7). Applicant planned to contact the collection firm in October 2009 (Item 2). He started\na savings account to accumulate funds to pay this judgment (Item 4). No other action\nhas been taken on this account. The judgment is resolved against Applicant.\n# SOR \u00b6 1.c. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied he owed the collection\nagency $2,488. He was renting an apartment in April 2004 when his employer advised\nhim to look for a new job because his employer was being sold (Item 2). Applicant\nspoke with his apartment manager about breaking the lease since he had to find\nanother job. The manager told him she understood his predicament, and there would be\nno problem in terminating the lease because of a waiting list of prospective tenants (Id.,\nItem 4). No independent verification was produced to substantiate Applicant\u2019s claim.\n\n3\nBecause the manager told Applicant she understood his problem, he had no intention of\npaying the past due debt (Item 2, 4). I find Applicant owes the debt.\n# SOR 1.d. Applicant acknowledged he owed this delinquent account amounting\nto $12,805 (Item 2). The last activity on the account occurred in November 2004, and\nthe account was assigned to a collection agency in October 2008 (Item 6). Applicant\nindicated that because his father anticipated an inheritance of money in September or\nOctober 2009, his father decided to give him property he had been renting. Applicant\nplanned to use the property as collateral in the repayment of this debt (Id.). On the\nadvice of several attorneys, Applicant indicated he started a savings account to\naccumulate money to pay the judgment in SOR 1.b. and the delinquent account in SOR\n1.d. (Item 4). Following the legal advice, when he saves $5,700 (25% of the total debt in\nSOR 1.b. and 1.d.), he will begin negotiating settlement with both creditors (Id.).\nApplicant provided documentation indicating his savings account totaled $510 in March\n11, 2009 (Id.). No additional information was presented concerning the savings account.\nThe SOR 1.d. account remains Applicant\u2019s responsibility.\nIn a credit report dated March 7, 2009, submitted by Applicant as an attachment\nto Item 4, he made handwritten entries claiming he paid certain creditors. The only\ndocumented proof Applicant furnished proving payment of any creditor, besides the\ncreditor in SOR 1.a., is a money order of $65 dated March 9, 2009, to an unlisted\ncollection agency (Id.).  \nApplicant believes he has always exercised good judgment and self-control, and\nhe has no gambling habit (Item 2). His financial problems were caused by his divorce,\njob change/salary reduction, and move occurring in the winter of 2002 and 2003 (Item\n4). For about a one and one-half year following his divorce, Applicant dropped into a\ndeep depression resulting in a lack of interest in personal and financial affairs (Id.). After\nhe resolves or reduces his student loan, his delinquent taxes for 2002 and 2005, and his\nchild support, in the next 1 to 18 months, he will have more money to save for the\ndelinquent accounts identified in SOR 1.b. and 1.d. (Id.). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted no evidence of his job performance. He supplied no\ncharacter evidence of his lifestyle away from the job. Lastly, there is no evidence he has\nhad financial counseling. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\n\n4\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is to reach a fair and impartial decision\nthat is based on common sense. The decision should also include a careful, thorough\nevaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person concept\" that brings\ntogether all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to the potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nParagraph 18 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) sets forth the security concern\nrelated to financial considerations: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\n\n5\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies to disqualify\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application because he owes four collection agencies\napproximately $28,925 that he is unable to satisfy. In addition, he is unwilling to repay\nthe balance on the lease (SOR 1.c.) he broke in 2004. \nThe last activity on the SOR 1.a. account before it became delinquent occurred in\nApril 2004. The last activity on the remaining three accounts was also in 2004. The\naccumulation of four delinquent accounts (one of those accounts becoming a judgment\nin October 2008) over the last five years triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations).\nFive mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. However, no mitigation is\navailable under AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). Even though the four\nlisted accounts became delinquent in 2004, Applicant has paid only $545 toward the\nsettlement of one account. But, since he has not complied with the remaining settlement\nterms on that account, he will probably have to negotiate another settlement or pay off\nthe balance of the original debt. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the remaining terms of\nthat settlement, and his unwillingness to repay the apartment lease balance, continue to\nraise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) does apply, but on a limited basis. The mitigator refers to\nunemployment, underemployment, marital problems, and other unanticipated events\nthat may hamper or impede a person from paying their debts. In addition, to gain full\ncredit under the condition, once the unexpected events pass, Applicant is required to\nact \u201cresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant had unforseen marital problems\nleading to his divorce, child support, and depression. He also confronted tax problems\nand unemployment/underemployment problems. Yet, the only documented action\nApplicant has taken on his delinquent accounts is a $545 payment to a listed creditor in\nFebruary 2009, and a $65 payment to an unlisted creditor on March 9, 2009. The lack of\nsubstantial action to address his debts since 2004 entitles Applicant to only limited\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ndoes not apply because Applicant has furnished no evidence of counseling. \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Documentation\nthat a payment plan has been established to repay an overdue account has little\n\n6\nprobative value without proof that at least some documented payments were made\nunder the plan. Applicant provided documentation he paid $545 to the SOR 1.a.\ncreditor, but he supplied no proof of any of the eight payments required to complete the\nsettlement. Applicant\u2019s payment of an unlisted creditor, and partial payment of the SOR\n1.a. creditor entitles him to limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).\nAG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue) does not apply to the circumstances of this case. Applicant provided no\ndocumented proof of his dispute with the SOR 1.c. delinquent account. His statements\nin his answer to the SOR and his interrogatory answers that he does not intend to pay\nthe debt cannot be mitigated under this condition, or any of the other mitigating\nconditions under the financial considerations guideline.\nThe limited mitigation Applicant is credited with under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) is\nnot sufficient to successfully rebut, extenuate, and mitigate the adverse evidence under\nthe financial considerations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial considerations guideline. I have\nalso weighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAt age 38, Applicant unexpectedly discovered his wife was having an affair. He\nnoted that in the one and one-half year period following his divorce in January 2003, he\nencountered difficulties with mental issues, finding a suitable job, paying his taxes for\n2002 and 2005, and paying child support. The credit bureau reports show that the listed\naccounts became delinquent in 2004. The credit bureau reports show that the listed\naccounts are still delinquent in August 2009. See, Item 5. In addition, Applicant\u2019s\ninterrogatory answers (Item 4) indicate that he still has the back taxes and student loan\nto resolve. Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to the FORM by providing\ninformation about the listed accounts as well as the back taxes and student loan. His\ndecision not to provide any information raises a reasonable inference that he has not\n\n7\nmade the remaining payments on the SOR 1.a. settlement, or payments on the other\ndelinquencies, including his back taxes and student loan. Without documentation of\npayments to his listed creditors and other creditors he mentioned, it is likely Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent financial trouble will extend into the future. Given that likelihood, he has not met\nhis burden of demonstrating his suitability for security clearance access.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on August\n21, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 26, 2009. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 1, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nJanuary 13, 2010\n\nGE 1; Tr. 16.\n1\nGE 1; Tr. 15-16, 20.\n2\nTr. 16-29.\n3\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on September 8, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on September 18, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on October 8, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 19, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 3, 2009. The government\noffered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She did not submit any exhibits.\nThe record closed on November 3, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on November 12, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated she received the hearing notice less than 15\ndays before the hearing. (Tr. 9.) I advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the\nDirective to receive the hearing notice 15 days before the hearing. Applicant\naffirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR. Her admissions are included as part of my findings of fact discussed below.\nApplicant, who is 25 years old, works as a security analyst for a Department of\nDefense contractor. She began her employment in August 2008.   \n1\nApplicant graduated from high school in 2002. She plans to start college through\nonline classes in January 2010. Approximately four years ago, Applicant began a\nrelationship with a man with whom she lived for several years. They never married, but\nshe has a two-year-old daughter from this relationship. Applicant ended the relationship\nin January 2009. Applicant now lives in an apartment with two co-workers and her\ndaughter.2\nIn 2006, Applicant opened two credit card accounts with one bank, which she\nused to pay her boyfriend\u2019s legal bills. He agreed to pay these charges, but did not. She\nalso had a bank account at this same banking institution. She opened two other store\naccounts and had a car loan. Applicant worked as a sales representative until January\n2008. From January 2008 until August 2008, she was unemployed. She did not receive\nunemployment benefits. During her unemployment, her boyfriend paid her normal living\nexpenses, but did not make any payments on her credit accounts.  \n3\n\nGE 3; Tr. 16-29.\n4\nApplicant is paid weekly. Eight months of the year, she receives four paychecks. Four months of the year,\n5\nshe receives five paychecks. I have calculated her monthly income on the basis of four weeks a month. See\nTr. 29.\nGE 3; Tr. 31-35.\n6\nGE 3; Tr. 27, 35-39.\n7\nGE 4; GE 5; Tr. 20-27.\n8\n3\nApplicant\u2019s car broke down in late 2007 or 2008. She did not have the money to\npay for the car repairs and for her monthly car payment. She learned that a class action\nlawsuit with the car company was proceeding through the courts because of mechanical\nproblems like hers. She asked the car company to repair the car, but it declined,\nindicating it would repay her if the lawsuit settled and payments were required. Based\non advice from her father, she voluntary returned the car to the car company. The car\ncompany treated this as a voluntary repossession.4\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net pay is $1,669.  She does not receive any child support\n5\nfrom her daughter\u2019s father. Her monthly expenses include $433 for rent, $400 for food,\n$200 for utilities, $75 for cell phone, $100 for transportation, and $100 for entertainment.\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s former boyfriend provided child care for their\ndaughter. She paid him $200 a month for child care and she purchased food for her\ndaughter while in his care. Applicant decided to end this arrangement. She enrolled her\ndaughter in a child care program, which began a week after the hearing. This program\nincluded three meals a day and cost $163 a week, for a total monthly cost of $652. She\nplans to pay this expense with the $200 child care expense she paid her former\nboyfriend and half of her monthly food expenses. Applicant lives paycheck to\npaycheck.   \n6\nApplicant pays her current monthly expenses. Since she does not have any\nadditional funds each month, she has not paid any of the debts listed in the SOR. In\nMay 2009, she applied for a government program to help pay her child care costs. She\nexpects to receive financial assistance early in 2010, which would eliminate her monthly\nchild care costs. She plans to use this extra income to repay her debts. She has not\nconsulted with a financial counseling agency. She is, however, working with a friend on\nher budget, looking for ways to cut small expenses. Since ending her relationship with\nher daughter\u2019s father, her monthly expenses have stabilized.7\nApplicant acknowledged all the debts listed in the SOR. She admitted to two\ncharge accounts and one account with the same bank. The bank sold these accounts to\ncollection agencies. Through the selling process, the account numbers changed and\none additional account with this bank appeared on the credit reports. Applicant has not\nchallenged the validity of the additional account or otherwise provided information which\nreflects that the account is not hers.  \n8\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and has been unable to\npay these obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose\nabout two years ago and are ongoing. This mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose during her relationship with her daughter\u2019s father, who failed to repay\nApplicant for debts incurred on his behalf, and when she was unemployed for eight\nmonths in 2008. Her debts arose from circumstances beyond her control. She lacked\nthe financial resources to pay her debts when she was unemployed, and still lacks\nincome to pay her past due debts. Thus, her debts remained unresolved. I find this\nmitigating condition has some applicability. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling, nor has she\ndeveloped a payment plan which would resolve her delinquent debts. While her current\nmonthly expenses are paid, she lacks the financial ability to pay her past debts. These\n\n6\nmitigating conditions are not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) mitigating conditions are\nnot applicable in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a grant. In\nreaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems began when she developed a relationship with her daughter\u2019s father.\nShe obtained credit cards to help pay his legal fees, believing that he would pay the\ndebt. In 2008, she did not work for eight months. Although her boyfriend paid living\nexpenses, she did not have any income to pay her bills, including her debts. She\nreturned to work in August 2008 and ended the relationship with her daughter\u2019s father in\nJanuary 2009. For the last year, she has been able to pay her current expenses, but\nlacks sufficient income to pay her past debts, even the small debts. A friend is helping\nher evaluate her monthly expenses and look for ways to decrease her spending. She\napplied for a government program to help with child care expenses, and if accepted, will\nuse this money to pay her past debts. At this time, Applicant has not shown a track\nrecord for payment of her past debts. Under the Directive, a sponsored Applicant can\napply for her security clearance one year from the date of this decision. If she can show\n\n7\nthat she has developed and complied with a debt payment plan, she would be a good\ncandidate for being granted a security clearance, assuming no other issues of a security\nconcern arise.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances\nunder Guideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B, \nForeign \nInfluence, \nGuideline \nE, \nPersonal \nConduct, \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations, and a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. His eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on August 23, \n2006. On August 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B, \nForeign Influence, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was signed and notarized on September 10, \n2009.  He requested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government \ncompiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 13, 2009. The FORM \ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 11. Additionally, in the FORM, the \ngovernment requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about the \nRepublic of Iraq and provided, for reference, six official U.S. Government source \ndocuments containing those facts. By letter dated October 13, 2009, DOHA forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information \nand objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on October 31, \n2009. His response was due on November 30, 2009. Applicant did not submit any \nadditional information within the required time period. On February 17, 2010, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains seven allegations that raise security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.), one allegation that raises a security \nconcern under Guideline E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and 19 allegations that \nraise security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. \nthrough 3.s.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the seven Guideline B \nallegations. He admitted the Guideline E allegation, and he admitted seven Guideline F \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.e., 2.h., 2.m., and 2.p.). He denied 12 Guideline F \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d., 2.f., 2.g., 2.i., 2.j., 2.k., 2.l., 2.n., 2.o., 2.q., 2.r., and 2.s.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old, married, and the father of three young children. He was \nborn and raised in Iraq. As a young man, he opposed the regime of Saddam Hussein \nand was imprisoned. At the end of Dessert Storm in 1991, he joined in an uprising \nagainst the Saddam regime and, for several weeks, was part of the leadership that took \nover and managed an Iraqi city until it was recaptured by Saddam\u2019s military forces. \nSoon thereafter, he and four of his siblings left Iraq. After two years in a refugee camp in \nSaudi Arabia, Applicant and his siblings immigrated to the United States. He became a \nU.S. citizen in 1999. Since 2006, he has been employed as an Arab linguist/cultural \nadvisor, and he seeks a security clearance. (Item 5; Item 6 at 5.) \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant traveled to Syria, where he married his wife. His wife is a \ncitizen of Iraq and has U.S. permanent resident alien status. He was introduced to his \nwife by a person who is now a high official in the government of Iraq. The official is \nmarried to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s cousin. Applicant and the Iraqi official are good friends. \nApplicant contacted the official when he visited Iraq for several months in 2006. The \nofficial has dined at Applicant\u2019s home when he has visited the United States. Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreceived a letter of congratulations from the official when he assumed his present job as \na linguist/cultural advisor.  (Item 6 at 10-11.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and three of his brothers are citizens and residents of \nIraq. Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her mother by telephone about once a month. (Item 6 \nat 11-14.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, who is deceased, was active in Iraqi political life, and he \nopposed  Saddam Hussein\u2019s Ba\u2019athist Party. When Applicant was unemployed in 2006, \nhe traveled to Iraq to visit his family. While in Iraq, he relied for his support on his own \nsavings. He was invited to speak about democracy. He gave several speeches to \nvarious community groups in which he described democracy and the freedoms that \nexisted in the United States. He also spoke on the telephone about reforming the \ngovernment of Iraq with his friend who holds a high position in the Iraqi government. \n(Item 6 at 8,11.) \n \n \nApplicant was first hired as an Arab linguist contractor in 2004. He served in Iraq. \nOne of the majors in his command allowed him to carry a firearm, unofficially, for \nprotection. When the command changed, another major confronted Applicant and \nadvised him that he was not authorized to carry a weapon. Applicant protested and \nreported that other linguists also carried weapons. He asked the major to reconsider his \ndecision. The major did not change his mind, and it was established that Applicant\u2019s \npossession of a firearm was in breach of his contract as a linguist. His command \nrequested his immediate removal and replacement. In November 2005, Applicant \nresigned from his job and returned to the United States. (Item 6 at 7; Item 7 at 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management in August 2008. The investigator discussed with Applicant \nfinancial delinquencies identified on his credit report of August 8, 2008. Applicant told \nthe investigator he would contact some of his creditors to determine the status of the \ndebts, and, if he owed the debts, he would pay them. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted responsibility for seven delinquent debts that totaled approximately \n$13,875. Applicant also denied 12 delinquent debts that totaled approximately $15,215. \nThe debts were established on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of September 19, 2006, August \n8, 2008, January 12, 2009, and July 9, 2009. He failed to provide documentation to \nestablish payment, settlement, or dispute of any of the delinquent debts alleged on the \nSOR. (Item 4; Item 6 at 15-17; Item 8; Item 9; Item 10; Item 11.) \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by the authorized investigator, Applicant reported a net \nmonthly income of $10,300. He also reported the following: household expenses: \n$1,639; debt payments: $1,733; net monthly remainder: $6,928. Nothing in the record \nsupports a conclusion that Applicant has received financial counseling. (Item 6 at 16-\n17.) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of facts about the Republic of Iraq. The facts in the \nfollowing summary were provided by Department Counsel to Applicant and to me. The \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nfacts were derived from official U.S. Government documents provided as attachments to \nthe FORM: \n \nIn 2003, a U.S.-led coalition removed Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist \nregime from power. In March 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office \nafter being freely elected by the Iraqi people. However, despite recent \nimprovements in the security environment, Iraq remains dangerous, \nvolatile, and unpredictable. Remnants of the former Ba\u2019ath regime, \ntransnational terrorists, criminal elements and numerous insurgent groups \nremain active throughout Iraq. Terrorism committed by illegal armed \ngroups receiving weapons and training from Iran continued to endanger \nthe security and stability of Iraq. Foreign terrorists from North Africa and \nother Middle Eastern countries continued to flow into Iraq, predominantly \nthrough Syria. Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) still possessed the means to launch \nhigh-profile attacks against Iraqi civilians and infrastructure. \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens of the dangers \ninherent in travel to Iraq and recommends against all but essential travel in \ncountry given the fluid security situation. Furthermore, the State \nDepartment has noted the following threats to security: \u201cAttacks against \nmilitary and civilian targets through[out] Iraq continue, including in the \nInternational (or \u2018Green Zone\u2019).  Foreign nationals and the facilities as well \nas Government officials and buildings are targeted. Such attacks can \noccur at any time.\u201d  \n \nIn addition, to terrorist attacks, sectarian violence occurs often. Moreover, \nthe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq has posted a travel notice that \nstates[:] \u201cThe State Department continues to strongly warn U.S. citizens \nagainst travel to Iraq, which remains very dangerous.\u201d \n \nThere are U.S.-substantiated reports of human rights abuses, including a \n\u201cclimate of violence; misappropriation of official authority by sectarian, \ncriminal \nand \ninsurgent \ngroups; \narbitrary \ndeprivation \nof \nlife; \ndisappearances; torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \nor punishment.\u201d The Iraqi government\u2019s effectiveness in adhering to the \nrule of law has been hampered by on-going violence, corruption, sectarian \nbias, and the lack of civilian oversight and accountability. Treatment of \ndetainees under government authority has been generally poor. The \njudiciary is weak, and judicial independence impaired by threats and \nkillings by insurgent, sectarian, tribal, and criminal elements. Security \nthreats hinder the ability of citizens to access the courts, and witness \nintimidation continues.1  \n \n1The facts recited in this summary are derived from the following source documents: U.S. Department of \nState, Background Note: Iraq, February 2008; U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information: \nIraq, October 22, 2008; U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iraq, June 13, 2008; U.S. Embassy, \nBaghdad, Iraq, Information for Travelers, printout dated May 21, 2009; U.S. Department of State, Country \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n    \n \n \n \n              Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nReports on Terrorism 2008, Chapter 2;  Country Reports: Middle East and North Africa Overview, April \n30, 2009 (pages 1, 5, 6, excerpts concerning Iraq (3 pages); U.S. Department of State, 2008 Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices: Iraq, February 25, 2009 (37 pages.) The verb tenses in the summary \nare as in the original.    \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n                                                         Analysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \nThe United States strongly supports Iraq\u2019s advancement toward a democratic \nfree society. Despite remarkable advances in achieving this new governmental status, \nIraq remains a dangerous and volatile country. Many groups, including former Ba\u2019athist \nIraqis, transnational terrorists, criminals, and insurgents, have migrated to Iraq with an \nintent to destroy or destabilize the current U.S.-backed government.  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant traveled to Iraq to visit his three brothers who are citizens of \nIraq. While there, he appeared in several public fora and delivered lectures about \nfreedom and the democratic process, thereby exposing himself and his family to \nretaliation and danger. \n \nApplicant counts an Iraqi high government official as a personal friend. The \nofficial introduced Applicant to the woman who became Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s cousin is the wife of the official, making Applicant and the official extended family \nmembers. The official sent Applicant a congratulatory letter when he acquired his most \nrecent job as a contractor linguist and cultural advisor. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, a citizen of Iraq and a U.S. permanent resident alien, resides \nwith him in the United States. Her mother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s \nwife is close to her mother, and she communicates with her mother monthly by \ntelephone.  \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts in this case raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d) reads: \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, \nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his wife and his brothers in Iraq are neither casual \nnor infrequent, but are based on long-standing family ties of affection and obligation. \nMoreover, his wife\u2019s relationship with her mother, who is a citizen and resident of Iraq, is \nfamilial and based on strong ties of obligation and affection. Applicant\u2019s friend is a high \ngovernment official in Iraq and is aware of his work as a contractor linguist and cultural \nadvisor. The individual has dined in Applicant\u2019s home when he visited in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s long-standing relationships are with individuals with strong political \nand familial ties to Iraq.  His friend, who is also an extended family member by \nmarriage, is in a high position in the Iraqi government, making it possible that Applicant \ncould experience a conflict of interest or be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual or government and the interests of the \nUnited States. These facts raise ongoing security concerns which Applicant failed to \nrebut or mitigate. I therefore conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply in \nmitigation to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nIn 2005, when he was employed as a contractor linguist in Iraq, Applicant was \ntold by the responsible military officer in his command that he was not permitted to carry \na firearm, even though a previous responsible military officer had unofficially allowed \nhim to carry a weapon. Applicant was unwilling to comply with the second officer\u2019s \nrefusal to permit him to carry a weapon. He advised the officer that other linguists \ncarried weapons for self protection. He asked the officer to reconsider his position on \nthe matter. It was determined by U.S. military authorities that Applicant was in violation \nof his contract when he possessed and carried a weapon. Applicant resigned his \nposition and returned to the United States.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). AG \u00b6 \n16(d)(3) reads: \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is \nnot limited to consideration of . . .  a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d \n \nI have carefully reviewed the facts in this case and the several mitigating \nconditions under Guideline E. Nearly five years ago, Applicant carried a weapon openly \nfor self-protection in a difficult situation when he was serving as a translator in Iraq. He \ndid this with the permission of the military officer in charge of his unit. Later, when \nanother officer took command of the unit, he was told he could not carry a weapon. \nApplicant made an honorable choice, resigned his position, and returned to the United \nStates. I conclude that AG 17(c) applies to the facts of this case. AG 17 (c) reads as \nfollows: \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or it happened under \nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG & \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), DOHA\u2019s Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Applicant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply. If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for seven delinquent debts that totaled \napproximately $13,875. Applicant also denied 12 delinquent debts that totaled \napproximately $15,215. The debts were established on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of \nSeptember 19, 2006, August 8, 2008, January 12, 2009, and July 9, 2009.  \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by the authorized investigator, Applicant reported a net \nmonthly income of $10,300. He also reported the following: household expenses: \n$1,639; debt payments: $1,733; net monthly remainder: $6,928.  The record does not \nsupport a conclusion that Applicant has received financial counseling, and Applicant \nfailed to provide documentation to establish payment, settlement, or dispute of any of \nthe delinquent debts alleged on the SOR. I conclude that none of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is to be commended for \nserving as a contract linguist and cultural advisor in Iraq. He put himself in harm\u2019s way \nworking alongside U.S. Armed Forces on numerous occasions. He made significant \ncontributions to national security, fully aware of the risks to himself and his family. \n  \nHowever, a careful review of his family relationships in Iraq and his friendship \nwith a high Iraqi government official raise security concerns about his vulnerability to \nconflict of interest, foreign exploitation, inducement, and coercion. At the present time, \nIraq remains dangerous, volatile, and subject to unpredictable terrorist attacks. Despite \naggressive governmental action by the United States and Iraq, terrorist attacks have \ntargeted Iraqi citizens as well as U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians.   \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant acquired significant delinquent debt and \nfailed to meet his burden to show that the debts were satisfied or did not belong to him. \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved financial delinquencies also raise security concerns. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude that while Applicant mitigated security concerns under the personal conduct \nadjudicative guideline, he failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nforeign influence and financial considerations adjudicative guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.g.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. - 3.s.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H (drug involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, which DOHA \nreceived on May 12, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 14, \nNovember 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n2009.

He has not been charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type, non-traffic-\nrelated offenses. He has not had any debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy \npetitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid liens. Apart from the Drug Involvement discussed \ninfra, the case file contains no derogatory information about the Applicant. GE 1, GE 2. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nThe underlying basis of Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement is derived from his \nself-disclosure and is not disputed. Summarized, his past drug use consists of: (1) he \nused cocaine six times from about October 2007 to July 2008; (2) he contributed $40 \ntowards the purchase of cocaine one time during this time frame; and (3) he used \nmarijuana two times from about January 2008 to February 2008. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.c.) Applicant\u2019s use of drugs was limited to a discreet period and only occurred when \nhe was in the company of a former tennis team member, discussed infra. Response to \nSOR, GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 67-71. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFrom an early age, Applicant was an avid tennis player. He began playing varsity \ntennis in high school, which continued into college. AE B, Tr. 65-66. During his senior \nyear in college, Applicant shared a townhouse with three other tennis team members. \nOne of the tennis team members (friend) introduced him to cocaine in October 2007. \nApplicant used cocaine a total of six times. His friend also introduced him to marijuana \nin January 2008. Applicant used marijuana twice. His friend was the sole source of \ncocaine and marijuana and all uses occurred in the townhouse they shared. Tr. 65-71. \nIn July 2008, Applicant\u2019s friend wanted to know if anyone in the townhouse wanted to \ncontribute money towards cocaine and Applicant gave him $40. Tr. 82-83. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use was limited to a 10-month period. Tr. 87 \n \n \nApplicant described his drug use as a \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d Tr. 78. He \ncandidly discussed his drug use and accepted full responsibility for his actions. Since \nhis last drug use in July 2008, he has disassociated himself from his friend and does not \nassociate with anyone who uses drugs. Tr. 73-74, 81. Applicant credibly testified that he \ndoes not now use drugs and does not intend to use drugs in the future. Tr. 87-88. \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily underwent a substance abuse assessment performed by a \nqualified and licensed professional counselor and certified addiction counselor on \nSeptember 11, 2009. The counselor\u2019s evaluation included the use of Substance Abuse \nSubtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-3), Alcohol Use Profile (AUP), and Urinalysis \n(observed September 2, 2009 \u2013 Negative). The counselor concluded that the SASSI \nand AUP support and are congruent with Applicant\u2019s self-report of drug use, and noted \nApplicant does not have any indications of abuse or dependency issues. The counselor \nadded his negative urinalysis lends evidence of no current illicit drug use as well. The \ncounselor opined that after reviewing the SASSI, AUP, urinalysis results, and clinical \ninterview, it was his professional opinion that Applicant \u201cdoes not have an illicit drug \nproblem.\u201d He concluded that Applicant\u2019s commitment to remain drug free is credible \n\u201cdue to his maturity, stable personality and emotional condition, his understanding that \nhis use of illicit drugs was wrong, his 14 months of abstinence, and his strongly \nexpressed desire to pursue a career with [his employer]\u201d. AE D. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn statement of intent, dated August 24, 2009, \nthat he will continue to refrain from engaging in any illegal drug activity, with the \nunderstanding that any drug violation will result in the automatic revocation of any \nsecurity clearance held by him. AE C, Tr. 87-89. He stated that he will \u201cnever use drugs \nagain.\u201d Tr. 87. He added that he has found a career that allows him to excel, and that \nthe people in his workplace are mature and upstanding. Tr. 92-93. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, co-worker, and father testified on his behalf. His \nsupervisor and co-worker hold secret security clearances, are senior company \nemployees, and observe Applicant on a daily basis. Their testimony confirmed that \nApplicant is an honest, trustworthy and reliable employee. Applicant is their \u201cgo-to \nperson,\u201d who handles payroll for their 400-person division. They added that their \ncompany has no tolerance for drugs and are of the opinion that Applicant\u2019s past drug \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nuse is behind him. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and co-worker both recommended that he be \ngranted a security clearance. Tr. 15-48. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is an accomplished and successful attorney. He has been and \ncontinues to be involved with his son. Although they do not live near each other, they \nmaintain daily contact by e-mail and telephone contact on the weekends. They have \nsimilar sporting interests, which include tennis and soccer. Applicant\u2019s father has \ndiscussed with Applicant the serious implications of drug involvement and made it clear \nto him that drug use is unacceptable and dangerous. His father described him as the \n\u201cperfect\u201d son, who never gave him any problems. He described how Applicant \nunderwent a kidney transplant at age 18 and received a donor kidney from his mother. \nApplicant conveyed to his father that his drug mishap was an exercise of bad judgment \nand that will it not occur again. Tr. 48-63. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

He fully disclosed his drug abuse in his \nResponse to the SOR and at his hearing. He admitted to use of marijuana and cocaine. \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two drug involvement \ndisqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition);\u201d1 and AG \u00b6 \n \n1 AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, \nsale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of \ndrug involvement mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, \nsuch as: (1) disassociation form drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of \nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation.\u201d  \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d2 \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3, 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I(c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine). \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board \nstated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies. Applicant\u2019s last drug use was in July 2008, about 15 \nmonths before his hearing. His overall illegal drug use occurred during a 10-month \nperiod primarily during his senior year in college, and ceased altogether in July 2008. \nThe absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, his promise not to use \nillegal drugs in the future, and his favorable evaluation by a licensed professional \ncounselor and certified addiction counselor eliminates doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal drug \nuse.3   \n   \n                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. With maturity and new found responsibilities of his career, and \ncomplete disassociation from his former drug-using associate and former environment, \nhis 15-month period of abstinence, and signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation, he has broken his patterns of drug abuse, and \nhe has changed his own life. He has abstained from drug abuse and has no problem in \ndoing so. AG \u00b6 26(b) fully applies.  \n \nHis testimony and character evidence from senior company representatives \nshow Applicant\u2019s work behavior has not been indicative of a drug problem. He is viewed \nas a valuable employee, who is reliable, dependable, and professional. His value to the \ndefense industry is supported by senior company officials who know him personally and \nprofessionally, and by his own credible testimony and evidence presented. His father\u2019s \ntestimony demonstrated strong family support to avoid future drug use. At his hearing, \nApplicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career, \nand manifested a steadfast commitment to continue a lifestyle consistent with total \nabstinence of any drugs.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n3In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. His employer and family support him. He has a history of \nstable employment and a strong work ethic. This support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and \ncommitment to remaining drug free. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I believe \nApplicant has learned from his mistakes, and his questionable behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. In sum, I find Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d4 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.
