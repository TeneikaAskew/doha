Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence and Guideline E, personal conduct. DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 16, 2019. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 19, 2019, \nwith a hearing date of July 24, 2019. Because of a miscommunication, Applicant did \nnot attend the hearing scheduled on July 24, 2019. I granted a continuance and DOHA \nissued a subsequent notice of hearing on September 10, 2019, with a hearing date of \nSeptember 25, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection, \nexcept for GE 2 to which Applicant objected and I sustained. I included GE 2 in the \nrecord, but did not consider it. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as a hearing \nexhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-H (which were attached to \nhis answer), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Djibouti. Applicant did not object and the request was granted. The request \nwas not admitted into evidence but was included in the record as HE II. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted some of the SOR allegations and \ndenied one (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He was born in Djibouti in 1975. He graduated from \nhigh school there and completed his college in France in 1998. He immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in November 2015. He is divorced \nand has two children. His ex-wife and both children are U.S. citizens and residents. He \nis currently unemployed, except he is driving for a car service. (Tr. 7, 26, 31, 33; GE 1, \n3 AE D-E) \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that the Applicant failed to disclose the \nexistence of two brothers and six sisters on his April 2017 security clearance \napplication (SCA); and that on December 2015, he sent threatening texts and voice \nmessages to a classmate who was in his training class. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b). Under Guideline \nB, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s father is a retired Djiboutian congressman; that his \nbrother is employed by the United Nations office of West Africa; that another brother is \na colonel in the Djiboutian Army; that two sisters are employed by the Djiboutian \ngovernment agency; that another sister is a former Djiboutian congresswoman; that \nanother sister is the chief executive officer (CEO) of a major Djiboutian cable channel; \nthat a brother-in-law is a former Djiboutian ambassador; that a brother-in-law is a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncounselor to a Djiboutian ministry; and that a brother-in-law is a retired Djiboutian \ncabinet member. \n \n \nIn approximately 1999, Applicant was hired by the Djibouti Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and was sent overseas to work as a counselor. His brother-in-law was the \nambassador to the country at the time. Applicant later returned to Djibouti and quit \nworking for the government. He joined an opposition political party and began writing \nnewspaper articles in support of this political movement. He claimed these actions \ncaused derision with his family. He subsequently sought and was granted political \nasylum in the United States. He has not traveled outside the United States since 2008. \n(Tr. 26, 28; GE 3; AE D) \n \n \nIn December 2015, while attending a police academy course, Applicant \nthreatened a school administrator and a fellow student because he was failing the \ncourse. The threats were communicated by telephone and text messages. Several of \nthe texts were captured and submitted to school authorities. Applicant admitted this \nbehavior in his answer. As a result of his actions, Applicant was expelled from the \nacademy, barred from the academy campus, and charged with criminal harassment. \nHe was convicted and sentenced to one year of probation, fined, required to perform \ncommunity service, and attend anger management. He has had no similar incidents. I \nnote that when Applicant was asked about this incident during his May 2017 \ncounterintelligence (CI) interview, he gave a completely different account of what \noccurred at the academy, which led to his expulsion. That version lacks credibility. (Tr. \n33-39, 50-51; GE 4-5; AE B) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified as accurate his SCA in April 2017. In Section \n18, which requires a listing of relatives, Applicant failed to list two additional brothers \nand six additional sisters. Although not alleged in the SOR, he also failed to list his ex-\nwife and two children (I will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but \nI may consider it to weigh Applicant\u2019s credibility, determine the applicability of \nmitigating conditions, and in considering the whole-person factors). Applicant testified \nthat his failure to list his omitted siblings was not intended to deceive the government. I \ndo not find his testimony credible. During a polygraph interview in May 2017, he \nadmitted deliberately withholding this information in order to increase his chances for \nemployment. (Tr. 29, 31, 48; GE 1, 3; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his father died in February 2019. He admitted that the \nremaining relatives listed in the SOR were in the locations and positions as alleged. His \nbrother employed by the United Nations is still in that position. Applicant\u2019s last contact \nwith him was in February 2019. He has no further information about his brother who is \na colonel in the Djiboutian Army. His last contact with this brother was in 2008. His two \nsisters remain working for the Djiboutian Ministry of Energy. His last contact with them \nwas in February 2019. His sister who was a former Djiboutian congresswoman now \nlives in France. His sister remains the CEO of a cable company. It is a French-owned \ncompany. He cannot recall his last contact with this sister. His brother-in-law is no \nlonger the Djiboutian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. He has had no recent \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontact with him and does not know his current location. His brother-in-law remains the \ncounselor to the Djiboutian Ministry of Transportation. He was also the former CEO of \nthe Djibouti airport. Applicant has no regular contact with him. His last contact with the \nbrother-in-law who was the Djibouti Secretary of Energy was in 2008. (Tr. 39-45; \nAnswer; AE D)  \n \nDjibouti \n \nDjibouti is a republic with a parliament and executive branch led by the \nPresident. Djibouti is strategically located in the Horn of Africa and is a key U.S. partner \non security, regional stability, and humanitarian efforts across the region. (HE II; Note: \nno information was provided concerning Djibouti\u2019s human rights record or potential ties \nto terrorist activities)    \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s threatening behavior towards a school staffer and fellow student led \nto his expulsion from the police academy, barment from the college campus, and a \ncriminal conviction. This conduct as a whole demonstrates questionable judgment, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nuntrustworthiness, and shows an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to list several brothers and sisters on his SCA. In a \nsubsequent interview with a polygrapher, he admitted intentionally withholding \ninformation in order to secure a job. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe guidelines also include conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant:   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.   \n \nAlthough the police academy incident is somewhat removed in time and \nApplicant successfully completed the terms of his sentence, he also minimized his \nculpability in a subsequent statement. This suggests that he failed to take full \nresponsibility for his actions. Applicant also failed to disclose several siblings, his ex-\nwife, and two children on his SCA. He subsequently admitted these nondisclosures \nafter prompting by investigators. Overall, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony on these \nmatters not credible and unreliable. He demonstrated a pattern of untruthfulness and \ndeceit that casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of \nthe mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated \nor induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n7 \n \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant has two brothers, three sisters, and three brothers-in-law who are \ncitizens and residents of Djibouti, and hold influential positions there. His father died in \nFebruary 2019 and one sister, the former congresswoman, now resides in France. \nThose two relatives no longer create a heightened risk of exploitation. The same \ncannot be said for the remaining relatives listed in the SOR. Though he has not visited \nDjibouti since moving to this country, Applicant has had recent contact with several \nsiblings. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.   \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nBased upon the prominent positions several of Applicant\u2019s relatives currently \nhold, or have held, in Djibouti, a situation exists where Applicant could be placed in a \nposition to choose between the interests of his relatives in Djibouti and those of the \nUnited States. Although Applicant has lived in the United States since 2008, he failed \nto produce evidence of substantial ties to this country through his employment, \npurchasing of a residence, or other similar actions. On the contrary, the evidence \nproduced showed that Applicant engaged in criminal behavior, which caused his \nexpulsion from a police academy. As stated above, the protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration and any doubt must be resolved in favor of \nnational security. I am unable to find either of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome the \nsignificant security concerns that exist.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nassociates are vulnerable to government coercion. Applicant has not overcome the \nvulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress created by his relationship \nto relatives in Djibouti.  \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s circumstances in immigrating to the United States. \nOn the other hand, I have also considered Applicant\u2019s deceitfulness and false \nstatements on his SCA, as well as his expulsion from a police training program.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct or the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   2.a, 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs   2.b - .d, 2.f \u2013 2.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Those facts are set \nout in the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice - Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, marked as Item 7. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters \nof general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The pertinent facts \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old and married. He was born in Afghanistan in 1991. In 1992, \nhis father, a commander in the Afghan military, was assassinated. Shortly thereafter, his \nmother fled to Pakistan with Applicant, his sister, and his brother. They remained in \nPakistan until 2001 when they immigrated the United States as refugees. They became \nU.S. citizens in 2007 and continue to reside in the United States. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2009. He subsequently obtained student \nloans and attended a U.S. college between August 2010 and May 2015. He did not \ncomplete a degree. While in college, he was unemployed for some months and financially \nsupported by his brother. (Items 4-6)  \n \n \nApplicant visited Afghanistan multiple times since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2007: \nfrom December 2013 to January 2014; June 2014 to July 2014; December 2014 to \nJanuary 2015; March 2015; July 2015; August 2016; June 2017; and August 2017. In \nDecember 2013, Applicant married his wife in Afghanistan. She is an Afghanistan citizen \nand was residing there at the time. (Items 4 and 6) Applicant and his wife had a son born \nin Afghanistan. In 2017, his wife moved to the United States with their young son and she \nbecame a permanent U.S. resident. (Item 3)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. His mother-in-law is a homemaker and his father-in-law is a taxi driver. His \nfather-in-law is also Applicant\u2019s uncle. Applicant has three brothers-in-law. Two are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. One brother-in-law is citizen of Afghanistan and a \npermanent U.S. resident. That brother-in-law previously worked for the Afghan police. \nApplicant has monthly contact with his in-laws residing in Afghanistan. Applicant stayed \nwith his in-laws when he visited Afghanistan. (Item 3, 4, 6)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant has eight friends and a cousin, who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. He has yearly contact with six friends and quarterly contact with two friends. \nHe contacts his cousin yearly. (Item 5) Applicant said that since his wife has moved to the \nUnited States, he no longer needs to maintain contact with multiple family members or \nfriends in Afghanistan. (Item 3) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from May 2017, January 2018, and May \n2018, the SOR alleged six debts that became delinquent between 2014 and 2018, and \ntotaled over $14,503. They included an automobile repossession, three unpaid credit \ncards, an unpaid cell phone bill, and unpaid tuition. (Items 8, 9, 10) \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that he is responsible for resolving the alleged \ndebts. He said that he is making payments on the $371 credit card debt. The most recent \nCBR confirmed that the $371 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a had a balance of $143 as of April \n2018. (Item 10). He also stated that he paid the $143 cell phone debt, but there is no \nevidence to confirm that status. Applicant said he intended to pay the other four debts \nwhen he has more money. (Item 3)  \n \n \nAccording to the May 2018 CBR, Applicant has student loans that total about \n$53,350. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that one of those loans has a delinquent balance of $2,607. \nApplicant has not made arrangements to make payments on that loan. He makes nominal \npayments of $1 to $3 on several other student loans. (Item 10)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed full-time from October 2015 to January 2016 with a \ntemporary staffing firm. He then obtained a full-time position with a healthcare company. \nHe continues to work for that company while his application for a security clearance is \npending. (Item 6) \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he provided $19,400 of financial support to his wife from \n2013 until 2017, before she moved to the United States. Throughout the case file, he \nstated that as a consequence of sending her money and traveling to Afghanistan, he did \nnot have sufficient money to pay the alleged delinquent debts. (Items 3-6) \n \n \nApplicant did not provide a current budget or other information related to his \nfinancial obligations from which to determine his current financial reliability, compliance \nwith payment agreements, or ability to maintain payments on the debts. There is no \nevidence that he has financial investments or other monetary connections in the United \nStates. Applicant asserts that his loyalty is to the United States. (Item 2)   \n \nAfghanistan \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the state of Afghanistan. Specifically, Afghanistan faces \nmany challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are \nincreasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, \nand the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be \n\n \n \n \n \n4\navoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights situation; the active and \nhostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and \nextremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military \nforces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. \n.  \nPolicies \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \neligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 1  and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, that factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \nAfghanistan has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate \nopenly and contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections and \nfrequent visits to family and friends there generate  significantly heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant has ongoing connections with his in-laws and friends, who are citizens \nand residents of Afghanistan. He frequently visited those in-laws and provided support to \nhis wife from 2013 until 2017 while she lived there with her parents. These relationships \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists \nand insurgents in Afghanistan seek intelligence or engage in behaviors that are hostile to \nthe United States\u2019 interests. Applicant\u2019s relationship with family members and friends \ncreates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation or technology and his desire to help family members living in Afghanistan. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the substantial anti-western insurgent and terrorism threats \nin the region, Applicant did not demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government \nand those of the United States due to his family ties there. He has perfectly legitimate and \nappropriately close relationships with family members and friends now living in \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAfghanistan, and a strong interest in protecting those people. His communication and \ncontact with them are neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, he failed to establish the \nmitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c). \n \nThe evidence also fails to establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has some connections to the United States: his \nmother, and two siblings are citizens and residents of the United States; he graduated \nfrom a U.S. high school in 2009; he is currently employed with a U.S. healthcare company; \nand in 2017, his wife and child came to live with him in the United States. However, those \nconnections do not outweigh his strong and recent connections to Afghanistan where he \nspent a significant amount of time between 2013 and 2017, met his wife, married, and \nhad his son. While there, he stayed with his in-laws and saw friends. His father-in-law is \nalso his uncle. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are so \ndeep and longstanding that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests \ninvolving to his family in Afghanistan in favor of the U.S. interests. Accordingly, he did not \nfully mitigate the security concerns raised under this condition. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation.2 \n \nBased on his admissions and CBRs, Applicant has a history of being unable and \nunwilling to meet financial obligations, which began in 2014 and continues into the \npresent. The evidence raises security concerns under the above disqualifying conditions, \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Four are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR arose between 2014 and 2018; five of \nthe debts remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply, as his failure to address the \ndelinquent debts over the past years casts doubt on his reliability and judgment. Applicant \nstated that he could not pay his debts after he married in 2013 because he was sending \nhis wife financial support and traveling to Afghanistan to visit her. Both of those \ncircumstances were within his control. He did not provide evidence that he attempted to \nresponsibly manage his financial obligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is no \nevidence that Applicant participated in credit or financial counseling, and that his \ndelinquent debts are being resolved and under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He \nprovided evidence that he was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, establishing mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(d) for this debt. He did not submit evidence that he made-good faith efforts to \nrepay or resolve any of the other five debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to them.  \n \n \n                                            \n2 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe Guideline B security concerns do not arise from any questionable conduct by \nApplicant, but rather circumstances that are normal results of his family situation. There \nis no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States. He expressed loyalty to the United States. Although his immediate family \nmembers now live in the United States, he (and presumably his wife) continues to have \nstrong connections to Afghanistan, as demonstrated by his numerous trips there between \n2013 and 2017, and consistent contact with family and friends since then. As a \nconsequence of those relationships, he has chosen not to prioritize the resolution of \nfinancial obligations he incurred in the United States, which establish the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts \nand circumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and financial considerations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n                     For Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b through 2.f: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 5, 2017. On \nFebruary 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, admitting all of the SOR allegations. He \nadmitted to using marijuana (MJ) with varying frequency since 2001; using LSD once; \nand hallucinogenic mushrooms twice, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Applicant \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me \non January 3, 2019. On February 21, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n04/25/2019\n\n2 \n \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the video teleconference (VTC) hearing was scheduled for \nMarch 28, 2019. I convened the VTC hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted a packet of documents, which was \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A (AE A) and admitted without objection. (Tr. 20) It included \nfive attachments to Applicant\u2019s previous response to a file of relevant material (FORM) \nsubmitted by the Government. These will be referred to as attachments 1-5.

He previously left graduate school to work for a major \nautomobile manufacturer in Detroit from 2014 to 2017. He was married in 2013 and \nreports no children and no military service. Applicant has not previously held a security \nclearance. (Tr. 43)   \n \nOn May 5, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), and \nin section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded \u201cyes\u201d to questions about \nillegal drug use and/or misuse of prescription drugs within the last seven years. He \nestimated his use of marijuana MJ was from 2001 with varying frequency and his last use \nwas in 2017.2 He also disclosed that he used LSD once in 2016, and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms twice, in 2010 and 2015.3 He indicated that his spiritual and soul-searching \nexperiences are over and he does not intend to use any controlled substances in the \nfuture. He also signed a statement promising to abstain from future use of illegal drugs \nand medicinal MJ and acknowledging any future use would be grounds for revocation of \nhis national security eligibility. (AE A, attachment 1; Tr. 15) \n \nApplicant was forced to take medical leave from college in 2010 due to a \ndevastating disease diagnosis. (Tr. 22) He required extensive surgery, removal of a large \npart of his intestine, and multiple transfusions. (Tr. 23) He provided a detailed summary \nof his medical conditions and treatments. (AE A, Attachment 4) He is coping with multiple \nlife-threatening illnesses. He also required an ostomy bag (Tr. 26) Consequently, he \nsuffered from anxiety and depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \ndue to what he describes as a lack of adequate coping skills. (Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant described himself as a socially awkward youth. He smoked marijuana  \nsocially every couple of weeks during high school (HS) due to peer pressure. However, \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 5, 2017 SCA (GE \n1).  \n \n2 At the hearing, he testified that his last use of medical marijuana was in December 2018. \n \n3 GE 1, pp.  32-33. \n\n3 \n \nhe stopped using it early in HS when his mother caught him in 2003. He resumed using \nMJ in college, but never purchased MJ or sold it. (Tr. 31-32) He used MJ once every two \nor three months in college. (Tr. 57) He stopped using MJ socially once he started working \nfull time after college as it no longer fit his lifestyle and he no longer associated with the \nsame friends. (Tr. 31)  \n \nThe first time Applicant took hallucinogenic mushrooms was in 2010 after his initial \ndiagnosis. (Tr. 32) They were a gift. (Tr. 52) A friend suspected Applicant was depressed \nand offered the mushroom suggesting it would help. The second time was when Applicant \nand his wife took mushrooms that were given to them as a proposed bonding experience. \n(Tr. 33) Neither one liked the effects nor will they ever use mushrooms again. (Tr. 33) \nApplicant also admitted to experimenting with LSD one time in 2016. (Answer, Tr. 33) It \nwas offered to him in a social setting at a Spring festival. (Tr. 34) He did not enjoy it and \nwill never try it, or any other illegal drug, again. He no longer associates with the festival \nattendees. (Tr. 34)  \n \nMost of the pain management surrounding Applicant\u2019s multiple surgeries was \nopiate based. (Tr. 35) He was prescribed medicinal MJ by a physician in April 2017 to \nhelp with stress and aid recovery. MJ was legalized in his state in 2008. (Tr. 60) He \nreceived a medical marijuana card. (AE A, attachment 5, Tr. 35) Applicant testified \ncredibly that the medical MJ helped with his unique medical conditions. (Tr. 36) He last \nused MJ recreationally before he left college in 2014. He believed that his medical MJ \nuse starting in 2017 was legal in his state, and he never shared it with anybody. Now, \nsince receiving the SOR, he understands that the Federal Government considers all MJ \nuse to be illegal. (Tr. 37) Applicant attributes his past drug use to untreated or poorly \nmanaged medical conditions. (Tr. 40) He is taking different medications now.   \n \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he informed his current employer about his medical \nMJ use. (Tr. 39) He was hired by a college friend who responded that it was fine so long \nas Applicant had the medical MJ certification. (Tr. 39) He concedes that his MJ use before \n2014 was illegal. (Tr. 52) Applicant stopped using medical MJ in December 2018 after \nenduring two more surgeries in 2017. (Tr. 66) That was about nine months after the SOR \nissued. (Tr. 65) He did not stop using sooner due to confusion about the interplay of \noptions and laws surrounding MJ use. (Tr. 66) \n \nApplicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and \nhe did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ \nrecreationally. He last used MJ recreationally in 2014, and subsequent use was under \nphysician\u2019s care and for medicinal purposes only.   \n \n \n                                           Policies \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n\n4 \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n          The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG  \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n\n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n          The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \n \n           Applicant used MJ on sporadic social occasions while he was in high school and \ncollege. He experimented with mushrooms twice, and LSD once, when these drugs were \ngiven to him over three years ago. He resumed use of MJ, on a medicinal basis, in April \n2017, and ceased medical MJ use in December 2018 once he understood the impact on \nthe security clearance process. The government provided sufficient evidence to establish \nthat the disqualifying conditions above are applicable, and the burden shifts to Applicant \nto show mitigation.  \n \n \n           AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n           (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n           (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n     (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n                                                   \n \n              Applicant\u2019s last recreational use of MJ was over five years ago. He did not use MJ \ncontinuously during the period from 2014-2017. He self-reported and he has \n\n6 \n \ndisassociated from friends who use illegal drugs, and provided a letter of intent to abstain \nin the future acknowledging that any future use will be grounds for revocation of his \nnational security eligibility. He was confused about the laws in his state with respect to \nlegalizing the use of MJ and medicinal use of MJ. There is considerable confusion \nsurrounding the patchwork of state laws around the nation, legalizing MJ.4 \n \n \n \n         Applicant\u2019s recreational use of MJ and experimentation with mushrooms and LSD \nhas been mitigated by the passage of time. He self-disclosed his illegal drug use in his \nMay 2017 SCA. While, it is disturbing that Applicant continued to use medical MJ after he \nreceived the SOR, I am not convinced that he understood that his MJ use conflicted with \nfederal law, until he consulted with counsel. Moreover, Applicant presented a compelling \ncase that his medical conditions affected his physical and mental state, and probably \ncompromised his judgment temporarily. I perceive his voluntary disclosure as candor and \ncooperation. The government would never know about his earlier illegal drug use but for \nhis own disclosures. In any event, he now knows, and he has taken appropriate actions \nto overcome this disqualification including signing a statement of intent to abstain and \ndisassociating from former friends. His conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply and his self-reported \ndrug use is mitigated.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n                                                          \n4 The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: Changes to state laws . . . pertaining to marijuana \nuse do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations.  \n\n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Most importantly, Applicant was candid and cooperative \nthroughout the security clearance process. He has overcome significant adversity. He \nresolved the specific violations alleged in the SOR, and he has unequivocally declared \nhis intention to refrain from further use of illegal drugs.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement no longer remains a security concern. These self-\nreported offenses were committed under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has \nacknowledged the egregiousness of his drug involvement and taken steps to insure that \nsuch behavior does not recur. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:                     For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on June 1, 2018, and she requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 22, 2018, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on November 27, 2018. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through \n6, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list \n01/17/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwas identified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit (AE \nA), which was admitted without objection. The record remained open until December \n31, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. She submitted AE B, \nwhich was admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 6, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted four SOR allegations and denied the remaining three. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She recently began \nworking at her present job in approximately November 2018. She was laid off from her \nprevious contractor job and was unemployed from May to October 2018. Before that, \nshe worked for other federal contractors. She is married, but recently separated from \nher husband. She has four adult children. She has a high school diploma and has taken \nsome college courses.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns \nfor years 2012 and 2013, and that she had five delinquent collection debts totaling \napproximately $11,430. Four of the debts are delinquent medical debts and the fifth is a \ndeficiency from a vehicle repossession for a car loan she cosigned with her daughter. \nShe admitted not filing her tax returns during her interview with a defense investigator in \nMarch 2017 and during her testimony. The debts were listed in credit reports from May \n2016, August 2017, and May 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g).2  \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that she failed to file her tax returns because she \nexperienced a series of medical issues that debilitated her to the point that she thought \nshe had filed those returns when she had not. She was also unemployed during some \nof this time. She explained that she had hip surgery in 2009; back surgery in 2010; foot \nsurgery in 2013; and another back surgery, involving fusion, in 2014. She was heavily \nmedicated after these surgeries, which caused her to lose focus on daily life matters. \nAfter she completed her security clearance application (SCA) in March 2016, she \nreceived correspondence from the IRS indicating that she failed to file her tax returns for \n2012 and 2013. This is when she was first made aware that those returns were not filed. \nApplicant filed her 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns in April 2017. She contacted the \nstate taxing authority to determine what years she needed to file. Because of a \ncommunication breakdown with the state tax authority, she did not file her 2012 and \n2013 state tax returns until March 2018. She paid the required tax due for those years \n(totaling $80) at the same time. She filed all of her federal and state tax returns before \n2012 and has filed them all for tax years 2014 forward.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 5, 19-21; GE 1. \n \n2 GE 3-6. \n \n3 Tr. at 23, 25-27; Answer; GE 2-3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe status of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \nRepossession account-$4,626. This is an automobile loan account Applicant \ncosigned with her daughter in 2011. Applicant\u2019s daughter stopped making payments on \nthe debt, and Applicant continued to do so through approximately 2014. Her \nunemployment and medical issues caused her to stop making payments at that time. \nShe has been in contact with the creditor attempting to work out a payment plan.4 \n \n \nFour Medical Accounts-$2,788; $1,822; $2,144; $50. Applicant documented \nthat three of the medical debts were settled and are resolved. Concerning the remaining \ndebt, Applicant provided post-hearing information that she entered into a payment plan \nto make $100 monthly auto payments to the creditor. None of these accounts appear on \nher most recent credit report.5  \n \n \nApplicant testified that her current finances are in good order and that she \ntypically has an $800 monthly surplus after paying all her expenses. She is current on \nher car loan, her camper, and her student loans. Her May 2018 credit report \ncorroborates these assertions.6    \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 28-29; GE 6. \n \n5 Tr. at 29-30; Answer; GE 6; AE A-B. \n \n6 Tr. at 35; GE 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n\n \n5 \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns for 2012 and 2013, \nand she accrued several delinquent collection debts. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAlthough Applicant should have responded in a more timely fashion, she has \nresolved her federal and state tax issues. She also addressed her delinquent debts. \nShe missed filing her 2012 and 2013 tax returns when she experienced severe medical \nissues, which caused her to lose track of filing her returns. She also experienced \nperiods of unemployment. These were conditions beyond her control. Given her health \nand employment status, she acted responsibly by filing her tax returns before the \nissuance of the SOR and by addressing her delinquent debts. There are clear \nindications that her financial issues are being resolved and that recurrence is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) - 20(d) are applicable. Applicant filed her 2012 and 2013 federal and \nstate income tax returns and has filed all her succeeding tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, and the circumstances \nsurrounding her indebtedness, specifically the medical issues she faced from 2009 \nthrough 2014 and her periods of unemployment. I am convinced she will act in a timely \nmanner with her taxes from now on, and that she will not incur tax problems or \ndelinquent debts in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \n For Applicant: Leon Schachter, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On June 15, 2018, \nApplicant timely submitted a response in which he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was \nassigned the case on November 8, 2018. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February \n26, 2019, setting the hearing for March 27, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled.  \nThe Government offered nine documents as exhibits (Exs.). Applicant objected to \nthe admission of the documents proposed as Exs. 8-9. With the Government in \nagreement, those two exhibits were noted as proffered but not accepted, and the others \naccepted without objection as Exs. 1-7. Applicant offered testimony and eight \ndocuments, which were accepted without objection as Exs. A-H. The transcript (Tr.) was \n08/08/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nreceived on April 5, 2019, and the record was closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, \nand record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated all security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a computer systems analyst who has worked in administration for the \nsame defense contractor for nearly six years. He served for 14 years on active duty in \nthe United States Air Force, reaching the rank of staff sergeant and receiving numerous \nawards and notable performance ratings, and is presently a reservist. Multiple positive \nletters of recommendation were accepted into the record from individuals aware of the \nallegations raised in the SOR. (Tr. 20; Ex. A)  \n \nAt 39-years-old, Applicant supports and lives with his two children, as well as his \nfemale cousin and her two children. He is single. He volunteers within his community by \nassisting at sporting events. At issue in this matter are six allegations raised under \nGuideline J (1.a-1.f) and two allegations raised under Guideline E (2.a-b). \n \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant went out and ordered some take-out food. He and a \ndelivery person, with whom he previously had a disagreement, exchanged words. The \ndelivery person then cursed at Applicant. Applicant went indoors to complain to \nmanagement. Soon, Applicant was confronted by seven individuals from the take-out \nand a fracas arose. Applicant was arrested and charged with simple assault, a \nmisdemeanor, but the matter was dismissed. (Tr. 37-38) This was noted on his July \n2011 e-QIP. \n \n \nIn April 2003, someone was arrested and charged with marijuana possession in \na state near Applicant\u2019s state of residence. That individual was found guilty in absentia \nin July 2003. (see SOR allegation 1.e) Through some confusion, the named individual \nand Applicant have been assumed to be one and the same. Applicant was adamant he \nwas not the individual named in the case. He sought out clarification on the matter, and \nafter fingerprint verification, it was determined that Applicant was not the person \narrested and tried. (Tr. 36; Ex. F-1) Because the charge was in error and subsequently \nresolved, Applicant did not note this incident on his e-QIP. \n \n \nIn around October 2004, Applicant and his now ex-wife had a \u201csituation . . . \nwhere things got a little bit out of hand. We were arguing. She hit me in my nose. I \ngrabbed her by her arms, left some marks on her arm. Police were called.\u201d (Tr. 33) The \nspouses were charged with domestic assault (battery). The matter was ultimately \ndismissed. Based on what he was told during these processes, Applicant was under the \nimpression the matter would be deleted from his record and there would be no need to \nreport the incident on his e-QIP. (Tr. 35)  \n \n \nIn late 2007, Applicant and that same ex-wife were still married. He was fresh \nback from a deployment, the marriage was suffering, and he was relegated to sleeping \non the couch. One day in July 2007, he was awakened to his child screaming. He \ndiscovered his spouse hurting the child. A fight ensued and Applicant shoved his \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nspouse hard. The police were called and Applicant was arrested for second degree \ndomestic assault in November 2007. This matter was also dismissed. Although there \nwas no conviction, Applicant reported the incident in his July 2011 e-QIP. (Tr. 33; Ex. 1 \nat 34 of 39) Today, the former spouses are \u201cactually, like, best friends. . . .\u201d (Tr. 34) \n \n \nIn January 2010, during a New Year\u2019s Day party, Applicant was mildly intoxicated \nand punch was spilled on his clothes. Applicant borrowed a friend\u2019s jacket to wear, not \nknowing there was a controlled substance (amphetamines) in the pocket. Applicant was \nlater questioned about loitering, and the pills were found by the authorities. He was \ncharged with possession of the drugs. He explained his situation. The possession \ncharge was ultimately dropped in favor of the charge of loitering, a matter he disclosed \nin his 2011 e-QIP, at page 33 of 39, where he referenced the original charge for \npossession of a controlled substance. (Ex. 1 at 32 of 39; Tr. 29-30) \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant was with a female friend and his brother after driving to a \nsocial venue. Applicant left his cell phone in the car. As he went back to retrieve it, he \nsaw his brother being attacked and his friend calling his name. (Tr. 23-24) Applicant \ninterceded in the tussle and was eventually arrested for simple assault/robbery, felony \ncriminal charges. He noted the related charges on his more recent 2016 e-QIP at \nSection 22. (Ex. 2 at 35 of 42; Tr. 23-24) The case was ultimately dismissed after his \nbrother\u2019s trial resulted in a not guilty determination. (Tr. 41) \n \n \n \nOn July 26, 2016, Applicant executed an e-QIP (Ex. 2). Although he disclosed \nthe most recent event from May 2016 under e-QIP \u201cSection 22 \u2013 Police Record,\u201d he did \nnot list any of the earlier incidents previously reported on his 2011 e-QIP. This is true \nregarding questions inquiring about whether, in the past seven years, he had been \nissued a summons; been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime; or been \non probation. It is also true with regard to the questions inquiring whether, in his lifetime, \nhe had ever been convicted in any U.S. court of a crime; charged with a felony; \nconvicted of an offense involving domestic violence or crime of violence; or been \ncharged with any offense involving firearms, drugs, or alcohol. Having disclosed all \nincidents in 2011, except for the mistaken charge from 2003 and the 2004 domestic \ndismissal he was led to believe would be expunged and not in need of reporting, \nApplicant limited his disclosures in 2016 to the newest incident from May 2016. He was \nunder the impression that expunged or soon to be expunged charges need not be \nreported. (Tr. 35) Having listed the older incidents before, he had no intention of trying \nto mislead or obfuscate. (see Tr. 39)  \n \n \nSince the last incident, Applicant has successfully completed an anger \nmanagement course. He takes the path of avoidance in the presence of potential \nconflict. He has never been disciplined at work, where he is a valued employee. He was \npleased to receive a promotion two years ago. He has healed his relationship with his \nex-wife, with whom multiple alleged criminal issues arose.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s series of multiple arrests and charges are sufficient to establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nWith one exception, all of the criminal incidents alleged occurred about 10 years \nago and beyond. All of these incidents at issue were ultimately dismissed, except for the \n2003 drug possession charge which was shown to have been waged against him in \nerror. Both spouses were equally engaged in the marital spats, and each related charge \ndismissed without a determination as to fault. As for those charges brought for domestic \nreasons, each appears to have found him in the wrong place at the wrong time or in \notherwise exceptional situations.  \n \nToday, Applicant is older and wiser. Divorce has eliminated tensions between \nApplicant and his ex-wife; indeed, the two are close friends today. He has developed a \ngood work record and garnered high praise from peers. He volunteers within his \ncommunity with local sports. He is helping raise his cousin\u2019s children along with his own. \nThe record as a whole reflects that Applicant has been sufficiently candid with regard to \nthe incidents at issue, both in general and in response to inquiries (see below). In sum, I \nfind Applicant has mitigated criminal conduct security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant saw charges arising from the incidents noted in the SOR, \ndescribed above, dismissed against him. In addition, he failed to disclose all of the \nincidents at issue in the SOR in his 2016 e-QIP which, if purposefully done to obfuscate \nor falsify, could raise the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Four \nare potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n AG \u00b6 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nAs a threshold issue, there is no indication Applicant intended to falsify, \nobfuscate, or mislead when he failed to disclose the dismissed charges noted at SOR \nallegation 1.a-1.e on his 2016 e-QIP. He had adequately disclosed those matters on his \n2011 e-QIP, thus giving investigators sufficient knowledge of the instances to conduct \nan investigation, and limited his answers to the most recent incident from a couple of \nmonths earlier. He knew the earlier instances from 2002-2010 were known. Moreover, \ndespite the wording of the questions, he did not see a reason to repeat their disclosure. \nDuring the hearing, he displayed a weak understanding of expungement and dismissal \nwhich also may have contributed to his failure to answer the question correctly. \nRegardless, while it is clear he failed to note some of the incidents on his 2016 e-QIP, \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude they were intentionally wrong. Lacking such \nevidence, disqualifying conditions are only raised under this guideline with regard to his \npast criminal charges and dismissals.  \n \nAs for the actions by Applicant that give rise to both criminal and personal \nconduct security concerns, I add my thoughts from the preceding section to this \nguideline discussion. Those incidents not disclosed on the 2016 e-QIP are from 2002-\n2010 and, therefore, far from recent. Half the incidents transpired due to marital stress, \nwhile the other half is comprised of extraordinary incidents from his teens and twenties \n(i.e. pills in a borrowed jacket, misidentification by a court of being a defendant in cased \ntried in absentia, a confrontation with a take-out staff, etc.). None of these types of \nincidents are likely to recur given Applicant\u2019s divorce, his behavior management \ncounseling, and more mature personal focus on his career and activities. Given those \nfactors, I find Applicant raised mitigating concerns AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), (e), and (g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the two \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, his past military service, divorce, behavioral changes, maturation, \nand current lifestyle. \n \n \nApplicant is now on the cusp of 40 years of age. While charged with criminal \nconduct five times, a sixth charge having been brought incorrectly, Applicant has never \nbeen found guilty or pled either guilty or no contest. Each charge was dismissed. While \nhe was obviously in the wrong place at the wrong time on multiple occasions, there is \ninsufficient reason to conclude that his ill luck or dubious behavior will continue into his \n40s, particularly given his maturation and recent personal accomplishments. Applicant \nis aware that another, similar brush with the law could prove fatal regarding any security \nclearance granted here. Given these considerations, I find Applicant has mitigated \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: John Martinson, Personal Representative \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nNo disqualifying concerns were established under Guideline C, foreign preference. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and C. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on April 26, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On September 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn October 18, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 28, 2018. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.1 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e, \nwith explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1983. He lived there until he \nimmigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2006, he \nreceived his bachelor\u2019s degree from an Iraqi university. He is employed in the private \nsector, but is pursuing a linguist position with a federal contractor, for which he is \nseeking a security clearance. He has never been married and has no children.3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother, four brothers and his sister are all \nresidents and citizens of Afghanistan. It further alleged that one brother works for the \nIraqi National Police. The SOR also alleged that Applicant has one friend, who is a \nresident and citizen of Iraq, and who is also currently enlisted in the Iraqi Army; and a \nsecond friend, a resident and citizen of Iraq, who is employed by the Iraqi \nCounterterrorism unit. The SOR alleged that Applicant admitted his allegiance to the \nUnited States and Iraq was divided to about 50 percent to each country. \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). \n \n2 See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice).  \n \n3 Tr. at 20, 22, 65, 78; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2004 to 2008 for U.S. forces in Iraq. \nHe provided linguist services at several different locations and for several different \nmissions. In approximately 2005, he began working at a police academy providing \nlinguistic services to U.S. forces who were training Iraqi police candidates. He later \ntransitioned to missions that had him working \u201coutside the wire\u201d providing linguistic \nservices to U.S. forces at roadside checkpoints and providing liaison services between \nU.S. forces and local leaders. His work was hazardous. He experienced frequent rocket \npropelled grenade (RPG) attacks from insurgent forces. In approximately 2007, he \nbegan providing linguistic services at an Iraqi detention facility. At this facility, where \napproximately 20,000 Arabic-speaking detainees were held, Applicant translated \nsensitive written and oral documents for U.S. forces. He was awarded a certificate of \nappreciation from a U.S. Army Military Police Battalion for his work at the detention \nfacility.4 \n \n \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s mother (M). M is 68 years old and in poor health. She immigrated \nto the United States in 2015. She is a legal resident alien in this country (green card \nholder). She lives with Applicant who provides for her. She is currently visiting Iraq. She \nreturned to Iraq in May 2018 to visit her husband\u2019s gravesite (he passed away in \nJanuary 2018). She intended to stay approximately 15 days. She experienced bleeding \nwhile there and was diagnosed with cancer. Currently, she is undergoing chemotherapy \nand unable to travel. She is staying in the house her husband owned presently occupied \nby her sons and daughter. She intends to return to the United States when she is \nhealthy enough to do so. She has no affiliations with the Iraqi government or military.5  \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s four brothers and sister (B1-B4, S1). B1 immigrated to this country \nin 2015 with his mother. He is a legal resident alien (green card holder). He lives with \nApplicant and their mother. He works for a private sector employer. He took his mother \nto Iraq in May 2018, but returned alone after 15 days when she experienced medical \nissues. B2 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works for the Iraqi National Police as a \ncorrections officer. Applicant has infrequent contact with him, possibly on a quarterly \nbasis through social media. B3 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He is unemployed. He \nhas no government or military affiliation. Applicant has contact with him approximately \ntwice a year. B4 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works in customer service for a \ntelecommunication company. He has no government or military affiliations. Applicant \nhas quarterly contact with him. S1 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. She is a school \nteacher. Applicant has quarterly contact with her. All of Applicant\u2019s siblings were aware \nof his linguist work for U.S. forces from 2004 to 2008. There were no repercussions as a \nresult.6 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 23-25, 28-30, 34-35; Ans. (See attachment). \n \n5 Tr. at 59-64; GE 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 43-51; GE 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n3. Applicant\u2019s two friends (F1 and F2). Both F1 and F2 are residents and citizens \nof Iraq. Applicant met them when he was attending college. Applicant\u2019s last contact with \nF1 was in 2016. Applicant knew that F1 was in the Iraqi Army at one time, but now he \nhas no idea as to F1\u2019s status. Applicant\u2019s last contact with F2 was in April 2017. He \nknew that F2 was working for an Iraqi counterterrorism unit. At present, Applicant has \nno idea what F2 does for a living.7 \n \n \nApplicant addressed his apparent statement to a defense investigator in June \n2017 during his background interview. The investigator noted in his report that Applicant \nstated that his allegiance to the two countries was 50 percent each. In March 2018, \nwhen given a chance to review the investigator\u2019s summarized interview, Applicant \nexplained that he meant that he still appreciated the culture, history, and the arts of Iraq, \nhowever, he has no allegiance to the government of Iraq. His undivided allegiance is to \nthe United States as demonstrated by his willingness to put himself in harm\u2019s way while \nworking with U.S. forces in Iraq. During his testimony, he reiterated his allegiance to the \nUnited States, while also explaining that he will always love the history and culture of \nIraq. He documented that his Iraqi passport expired in 2016 and has not been renewed. \nHe has a current U.S. passport that was issued in 2017.8 \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant supplied character references from four military commanders \nassociated with his translator duties from 2007 to 2008. All those commanders noted his \ntrustworthiness and other positive character traits that made him a valuable asset. \nAdditionally, the Deputy Task Force Commander, a Marine major general, stated that \nApplicant \u201crisked his life in support of Coalition Forces in Iraq while other interpreters \nhave been kidnapped, killed, or quit. [Applicant\u2019s] dedication, commitment, and support \nto our cause no doubt saved the lives of American soldiers.\u201d9 \n \nAdministrative Notice. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The \nU.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to \nbe serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, \nmaintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.10 \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 51-53; GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 54-56; GE 2; AE A-B. \n \n9 Ans. (See attachments). \n \n10 HE II. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwith his relatives and friends living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist his relatives and friends living in Iraq who \nmight be coerced by governmental entities, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d11 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his relatives, or his \nfriends living in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members and two friends who \nare residents and citizens of Iraq, and his mother and B1\u2019s living arrangements with \nhim.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n                                                          \n11 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has limited contact with his relatives and \nfriends in Iraq. He presented sufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely that he \nwould be placed in a position to choose between the interest of his relatives and friends \nliving in Iraq and those of the United States. He already has demonstrated that he would \nput the United States\u2019 interests first when he worked as a translator from 2004 to 2008 \nwhile his family members were living in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He worked as a translator from 2004 to 2008 \nperforming different missions for U.S. forces where he earned praise for his loyalty, \nbravery, and trustworthiness while serving in harm\u2019s way. He became a U.S. citizen in \n2013. He currently works and lives in the United States with his mother and B1. The \nevidence supports that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States and would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. His \ncontact with F1 and F2 is so infrequent, he does not know the current status of either. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign preference\u201d as follows:  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \n \n \nWhile being questioned by a defense investigator, Applicant was trying to explain \nthat although he was a proud U.S. citizen, a country he risked his life for, he would \nalways have a love for the culture, history, and arts of his native country of Iraq. The \ninvestigator misconstrued Applicant\u2019s explanation as an admission that his allegiance \nwas split 50/50 between the two countries. Applicant credibly denied such was the case. \nApplicant\u2019s actions and words clearly indicate that his preference is toward the United \nStates over Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 10(f) have not been established. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the glowing comments by his commanders, \nwho attested to Applicant\u2019s loyalty and commitment to U.S. forces. I also considered his \nstrong ties to this country as a translator serving in harm\u2019s way while assisting U.S \nforces. He has demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. Therefore, \nhe provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. His actions also \nsupport his assertion that his allegiance is to the United States over Iraq.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated and that no disqualifying conditions were established under Guideline C.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph       2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

He came to the United States (U.S.) in 1996 to further his education because Turkey plummeted into chaos. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree 1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SCA) dated August 23, 2016 (GE 1) and the summary of personal subject interview conducted on September 25, 2017.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 23, 2016. \nOn February 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, foreign influence. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2018, admitting all of the SOR \nallegations with explanations under Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 19, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for January 24, 2019. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 - 2 were admitted into evidence without objection. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified, and he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 G, which \nwere admitted without objection. I left the record open until February 8, 2019, for \nApplicant to submit supplemental documentation. Applicant timely submitted post-\nhearing documentation including an e-mail dated February 7, 2019, and 15 pages of \ndocumentation showing the conveyances of two properties in Turkey that were owned \nby Applicant and his wife. These were collectively marked as AE H and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 5, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice - Turkey \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Turkey. The request listed supporting documents to show \ndetail and context for those facts. A risk assessment in this case necessitates \nadministrative notice of facts concerning Turkey.  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE 1 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The \nfacts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts from HE 1: \n \nNotwithstanding the long strategic U.S. \u2013 Turkey relationship, current country \nconditions are problematic.  The U.S. State Department urges citizens to avoid travel to \nTurkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups explicitly target \nWestern tourists and expatriates for kidnapping and assassination. The potential for \nterrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high. \nThe U.S. Government does not allow family members to accompany personnel \nassigned to the U.S. Consulate in Adana, unless they are working in the Consulate. \nTurkey is a transit country for foreign terrorist fighters wishing to join the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Since a July \n2016 coup attempt, the Turkish Government has operated under a state of emergency, \nwith far reaching effects on the country\u2019s society and institutions, restricting the exercise \nof many fundamental freedoms. Profound and significant human rights abuses persist.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and married. He reports no children. He was born in \nBulgaria and moved to Turkey at age seven. He came to the United States (U.S.) in \n1996 to further his education because Turkey plummeted into chaos. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree \n                                                          \n1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SCA) dated August 23, 2016 (GE 1) and the summary of personal subject interview \nconducted on September 25, 2017. (GE 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nbefore emigrating from Turkey. He obtained his Ph.D. in the U.S. in 2000. (GE 1, Tr. 12) \nHe has been employed as a senior engineer by a U.S. corporation since 2000 and he \nhas recently applied for another position with a federal contractor, which approval is \ncontingent on Applicant obtaining a security clearance. (Tr. 60) Applicant provided \ndocuments listing his professional accomplishments, including numerous certificates \nand awards, and 12 U.S. patents in his field of micro-electrical mechanical systems. He \nalso listed his academic accomplishments. (AE A, B, C)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he or his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, owned three real \nestate parcels in Turkey before he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 15, 47) His wife \npurchased an apartment in Turkey in 2006 before they were married. She is the sole \nowner. (AE H) He purchased a second property in Turkey in 2008. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s \nwife purchased a third apartment for her totally disabled mother to live close to her \nrelatives in 2012, the year of their marriage. (AE D, Tr. 50) The three real-estate \nholdings alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d have lost 50\u201360% in value compared to when they were \npurchased, due to the tumultuous conditions in Turkey. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant provided a \ngraph that visually depicts the details of their purchases of real estate in Turkey. (AE D) \nApplicant testified credibly that the exchange rate for Turkish currency (lira) was \nrelatively flat for a long time, but then it lost half of its value on world markets in a five- \nyear span from 2012 to 2017. (Tr. 48) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the property, which he purchased in Turkey in 2008, \nactually was not completely built until 2013, due to chaos in that country. (Tr. 74) \nTherefore, it could not be sold previously. Applicant\u2019s wife became a U.S. citizen in June \n2017. She was a market researcher in Turkey previously and she had no affiliation with \nthe Turkish government. Her mother also has a green card as a permanent resident in \nthe U.S. since 2017. (Tr. 76) Applicant testified credibly that it was extremely difficult to \nsell the real estate in Turkey due to instability, its loss in value, and a saturated market \nfrom overdevelopment around Istanbul. (Tr. 50-51, AE D) He provided supplemental \npost-hearing documents including a deed showing that the real estate he purchased in \n2008 has now been donated or conveyed to his sister under Turkish law. Applicant\u2019s \nwife provided a power of attorney (POA) dated January 28, 2019, to effectuate the sale \nof property purchased for his mother-in-law. (AE H) Applicant\u2019s former Turkish real \nestate interests had a total value of $337,000. (Tr. 58)  \n \n \nApplicant has telephonic contact with his parents once or twice a week. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant contacts his sister living in Turkey only in crisis. (Tr. 66) He had a falling out \nwith his sister because she is angry that Applicant lives so far away, and the care of \ntheir infirm parents falls to her. (Tr. 67-69) Applicant\u2019s 80-year-old father had brain \nsurgery in 2016 and he has not recovered well. (Tr. 30) Applicant testified that the last \ncrisis was when his father fell down and lacerated his scalp and Applicant flew to Turkey \nin September 2018 to assist. (Tr. 69) His father is prone to falling and often injures \nhimself. Applicant has visited Turkey about once a year for the last ten years. (Tr. 69-\n70) Applicant\u2019s 76-year-old mother had a heart attack and subsequent bypass surgery, \nalso in 2012. (Tr. 32) His parents never had any affiliation or employment with the \nTurkish government of intelligence agencies. (Tr. 42) Applicant never sent them \nfinancial aid.   \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owns real estate and other assets in the U.S. as well. He purchased a \nhome in September 2014, for $533,000. His mortgage on that property is down from \n$276,000 to $248,000. (Tr. 56, AE D) Applicant has more than 50% equity in that \nproperty. He also has a $287,000 retirement account; $262,000 savings account in U.S. \nbanks; and approximately $100,000 in publicly traded stocks and bonds. Applicant\u2019s \nU.S. assets, excluding real estate, total over $650,000. (Tr. 61) He has no intent to \nreturn to Turkey, unless it is to visit and help care for his parents in crisis. (Tr. 76, 93) \nApplicant communicates via telephone only with his parents in Turkey, and nobody else. \n(Tr. 81) Applicant testified credibly that the plan is for his parents to leave everything to \nhis sister, when they pass, as she has primarily cared for them. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are living in Turkey, but they are in desperately poor health. \nHe regularly communicates with them by phone as a dutiful son. His sister is a citizen \n\n \n6 \n \nand resident of Turkey. He has extremely limited contact with her. He regularly \ncommunicates with no one else in Turkey. He provides occasional care and comfort to \nhis parents during crises. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) are implicated by the evidence. Applicant divested himself of his real estate in \nTurkey. AG \u00b6 7(f) is no longer a security concern.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and   \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working and living in \nthe U.S. since 1996. He earned a doctorate degree from a U.S. institution and he has \nbeen a valuable member of the corporate workforce since 2000. He needs a security \nclearance to enable him to work for a federal contractor in direct support of DOD efforts \nglobally. The value of his U.S. assets eclipses the value of his former real estate \nholdings in Turkey, which he has now transferred to his sister. Although he is presumed \nto have strong bonds of affection with his parents and sibling in Turkey, these bonds are \nnot sufficient to offset or overcome his demonstrated, long-term commitment to the U.S. \nApplicant has effectively rebutted the presumption under all of the circumstances.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \n\n \n7 \n \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.2  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are Turkish citizens residing in Turkey, which is an \nunstable regime. His contact with them is limited, as needed, by telephone, and annual \nvisits. There is no indication that they were ever affiliated with the Turkish government \nor intelligence services. Applicant\u2019s foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant would \nreport contacts with his relatives by foreign intelligence agents, and that he has a long-\nterm commitment and exclusive loyalty to the U.S. All of the mitigating conditions in AG \n\u00b6 8 are applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n                                                          \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Applicant is 48 years old. He is married to a U.S. \ncitizen, educated in the U.S., and owns property here. Virtually all of his adult work life \nwas spent in supporting U.S. interests. He is committed to his profession and life in the \nU.S. His foreign contacts are minimal and he no longer has foreign real estate. He has \nno conflict of interest.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant  \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                      Paragraph 1, Guideline B:                         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n               Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n      Robert J.

He has been employed by his present employer, a federal contractor, since 2005. He earned a bachelor\u2019s of science in business management in October 2004. He has been married since 2000 and has two children, ages 18 and 15. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 1988. In June 1991, he received a general discharge due to his marijuana use while in the military. (Items 4, 5) Applicant was interviewed in September 2017 by an authorized DOD investigator for his background security clearance investigation. He told the investigator that he began using marijuana in 1986 while he was in high school. He admitted using marijuana on approximately three occasions while he was in the military. Since his discharge from the military in 1991, he admitted that he continued to smoke marijuana on a monthly basis to the present time. Prior to October 2015, Applicant would purchase marijuana from an individual\u2019s home. Since October 2015, he obtained a medical marijuana card and now purchases his marijuana from the dispensary, since it is legal to do so in his state. Applicant admitted he falsified his drug answers on the SCA because he was afraid the information would have an adverse impact on his security clearance. Applicant stated that he no longer plans to use marijuana because he now has no desire to use it. (Item 9) On the 2005 SC",

Applicant admitted he falsified his drug answers on the SCA \nbecause he was afraid the information would have an adverse impact on his security \nclearance. Applicant stated that he no longer plans to use marijuana because he now \nhas no desire to use it. (Item 9) \n \n \nOn the 2005 SCA, Applicant only disclosed marijuana use in March 1990. He \nintentionally failed to disclose his current use of marijuana, and that he used cocaine in \nat least 2000. Applicant voluntarily entered treatment in 2000 due to his use of cocaine, \nbut he did not disclose that information either. On the 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed \nthat he used marijuana in the military, and he disclosed his voluntary treatment in 2000 \nfor his use of cocaine. Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his current use of \nmarijuana, to include after he was granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007. \n(Items 4, 5) \n \n \nThe DOD investigator also questioned Applicant about the delinquent accounts \nhe listed on his 2016 SCA. Applicant stated that beginning in about December 2010, he \ncould no longer afford to make regular payments on these financial accounts after his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nspouse had her hours reduced by her employer. Applicant admitted that he has not paid \nany of his delinquent creditors. He was currently doing research into the possibility of \nconsolidating his delinquent debt, but he had not yet taken any action to do so. (Item 9) \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that while Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, \nand after being granted a DOD security clearance, he used marijuana between August \n1990 and June 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, \n3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant tested positive for marijuana while on active \nduty in April 1991. He received non-judicial punishment and the U.S. Air Force gave \nApplicant a general, under honorable conditions discharge (misconduct \u2013 drug use), in \nJune 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nThe third SOR allegation (\u00b6 1.c) alleges that Applicant continued to use and \npurchase marijuana from June 1991 to at least September 2017, to include after he had \nbeen granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his 2016 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose that he had used marijuana within the last seven years, and he deliberately \nfailed to divulge he had continued to use marijuana after he had been granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in January 2007. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nThe second SOR allegation (\u00b6 2.b) alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose on his 2005 SCA that he had used marijuana within the last seven years, and \nthat he had also used cocaine in at least 2000. Applicant admitted this allegation in his \nSOR response. (Items 1, 3) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted on six delinquent accounts in the \ntotal approximate amount of $24,292. (Items 1, 6-8) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $8,708.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen charged off in the approximate amount of $4,898.00. As of January 2018, the \n\n \n4 \n \n \naccount remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. \n(Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,283.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,172.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.e alleges that Applicant is indebted on a credit card account that has \nbeen charged off in the approximate amount of $2,041.00. As of January 2018, the \naccount remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. \n(Items 1, 3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.f alleges that Applicant is indebted for a utility service account that has \nbeen placed for collection in the approximate amount of $190.00. As of January 2018, \nthe account remained delinquent. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR \nresponse. (Items 1, 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana beginning in 1986 until September \n2017, including while he in the military and after having been granted a DOD security \nclearance in January 2007. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana for 31 years, ending in September 2017. Applicant has \nnot submitted any evidence of his abstinence from using marijuana. Although \nApplicant\u2019s recent use of marijuana was permitted under state law, such conduct \nnonetheless violated Federal law and DOD policies.1 There is no documentation that \nApplicant has completed, or is currently involved in, a recognized substance abuse \ntreatment program. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a), (b) and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed that the disregard of federal law concerning use, sale, or \nmanufacture of marijuana is relevant in national security determinations regardless of changes to state laws \nconcerning marijuana use in a memorandum dated October 24, 2014. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use on an SCA he \ncompleted in 2005, and on another SCA he completed in 2016. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant knew that he was required to list his illegal drug history on his SCAs. \nHe did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsifications on his 2005 SCA \nand 2016 SCA. He eventually disclosed his marijuana use during his September 2017 \nbackground interview, but over a year had passed since the submission of his falsified \n2016 SCA. Applicant admitted to the DOD investigator that he did not want to disclose \nhis adverse illegal drug use information on the SCA due to the possible negative \nconsequences to his DOD security clearance. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions \ndemonstrate a pattern of deception, and his conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. There is insufficient evidence to apply mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), and (c). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence established AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c). \nFurther inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant failed to provide any documentary evidence of payments, payment \narrangements, or other debt-resolution efforts. Similarly, he provided no documentary \nevidence demonstrating financial responsibility and good judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and has worked for his current employer since January \n2005. He was issued a DOD security clearance in January 2007. In light of his lengthy \ndrug history, Applicant\u2019s recent decision to abstain from marijuana does not mitigate the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. Applicant\u2019s repeated \nfalsifications cast serious doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment. There is no \ndocumentary efforts showing that Applicant has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndelinquent debts. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \nPAMELA C. BENSON \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Glassman, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant submitted an application for a security clearance (e-QIP) on February \n23, 2017. On February 28, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, \n2017.  \nOn April 3, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 10, 2018. \nAnother administrative judge was assigned the case on August 9, 2018.  On September \n21, 2018, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing on October 25, 2018. \nThe case was transferred to me on October 10, 2018, because of the unavailability of \nthe assigned administrative judge. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the \nhearing, the Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \n(Gov) Exhibits 1 - 5. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered one exhibit \nwhich is admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A (consisting of a green notebook containing \n01/24/2019\n\n2 \n \na brief from Applicant\u2019s counsel and five attached exhibits), without objection. The \ntranscript was received on November 2, 2018. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations.    \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior-level employee for a DOD contractor who seeks \na security clearance. He has been employed with the DOD contractor since June 2013. \nHe has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand has also attended executive-education courses. He is married and has three \nchildren. Two are in college and the youngest is in high school. (Tr.17-22, 34, 53; Gov \n1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited \nsources contain more specific information.)  \n \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nin February 2014 and in January 2016 after being granted a security clearance in 2008.  \nThe same conduct is cross-alleged under the personal conduct concern. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but states he did not believe he \nwas committing a crime because marijuana use occurred in a state where marijuana \nuse is legal. (Response to SOR, dated April 3, 2018)  \n \nOn September 25, 2014, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) for a periodic reinvestigation.  In response to Section \n23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Applicant listed that he used marijuana once \non vacation. He believed marijuana was legal in the state where he used it. Applicant \nindicated on his e-QIP application that \u201cIt was legal in [state redacted], or so I thought at \nthe time.\u201d (Gov 2, section 23)  \n \nOn August 29, 2014, Applicant submitted a Standard Form 86 (SF 86), seeking \nto upgrade his security clearance for access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI). His sponsor was another government agency who sponsored him for his work as \na contractor with the agency. In response to questions regarding illegal drug use, he \nlisted marijuana use in January 2013 in a state where marijuana use was legal and \nmarijuana use in June 2014 with his former college roommate. The location as to where \nthe use occurred in June 2014 was cut off on the SF 86. (Item 5 b) The January 2013 \nand June 2014 marijuana usage was not alleged in the SOR.  As such, it will not be \nconsidered under the disqualifying factors, but will be considered when applying matters \nof extenuation and mitigation.   \n \nAs part of processing for SCI access, the other government agency had \nApplicant execute a Personnel Security Policy Advisory on August 29, 2014, which \nstates: \n \nAs a condition of receiving or retaining security clearance with [other \ngovernment agency], you are required to adhere to various personnel \n\n3 \n \nsecurity policies. These policies are in effect to provide NSA affiliates from \nbeing targets of espionage and other hostile activities carried out by or on \nbehalf of foreign intelligence entities.\u201d The policies included: \n \nImproper Use of Drugs \u2013 The improper usage of drugs by [other \ngovernment \nagency \naffiliates] \n(e.g., \n[other \ngovernment \nagency] \nemployees, \nmilitary \nassignees \nor \nrepresentatives, \ncontractors, \nconsultants, and experts) and applicants is strictly prohibited. Improper \nuse includes the illegal use of controlled substances as will as the use, \ntransfer, possession, sale or purchase of any drug for purposes other than \ntheir intended medical use. . . .  \n \nFailure to observe the policies summarized above may constitute grounds \nfor disqualification from initial or continued access to [other government \nagency] information and facilities. Your signature below indicates your \nunderstanding and willingness to comply with these policies. \n \nWhile the actual statement signed by Applicant is not in the record, the \nClearance Decision statement of the other government agency indicates he signed the \nstatement on August 29, 2014.  (Gov 5a)   \n  \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting a background \ninvestigation on June 12, 2015. I considered the summary of the interview, but gave it \nless weight because it is unsworn and unauthenticated. (See Directive, enclosure 3, \npara 1.20) Applicant\u2019s 2014 marijuana use was discussed during the interview.  The \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of the interview states that Applicant had no desire to try \nmarijuana again because he now realizes marijuana use remains illegal under federal \nlaw. (Gov 4)  Applicant did not recall this interview or making the above statement. He \nconceded under cross-examination that if it was in the statement he probably said it. \n(Tr. 59)  \n \nOn January 11, 2016, Applicant underwent a counterintelligence polygraph. \nDuring the pre-polygraph interview, Applicant told the polygrapher that he used \nmarijuana in 2014 and 2016 while on vacation in a state where marijuana use was legal.  \nHis most recent use of marijuana occurred about two weeks before the polygraph. He \nbelieved that it was okay to use marijuana because it was legal in the state where he \nused it. The polygrapher told him that the use of marijuana was not okay because \nmarijuana use was still illegal under federal law. Applicant claimed that he was not \naware of this until he was so advised by the polygrapher. Applicant testified the \npolygrapher told him something to the effect that they would not be having this \nconversation a year from now, implying that marijuana may become legal nationwide. \n(Tr. 35-36; Gov 3 at 9-10 )  \n \nThe polygrapher asked Applicant if he intended to use marijuana in the future.  \nApplicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d never use it again.\u201d Applicant testified he \nintended to be honest and meant that he might possibly use marijuana again if it \nbecame legal under federal law or if he retired and traveled to a place where marijuana \nis legal. He stressed that he had no intentions of using marijuana while possessing a \n\n4 \n \nsecurity clearance and while working for the U.S. government. He believes the \npolygrapher mischaracterized his answer. (Tr. 38-39, 60-61; Gov 3 at 10)  \n \nThe polygrapher summarized the interview as follows: \n \n[Applicant] reported that from approximately January 2013 to January \n2016, he smoked marijuana approximately twice a year. In each instance, \nhe was given marijuana free of charge from a friend. He reported that the \nlast time he smoked marijuana was \u201cthis past Thursday,\u201d which was 7 \nJanuary 2016. He reported that he had an active security clearance at the \ntime. [Applicant] initially reported that he is likely to smoke marijuana again \nin the future; however, when asked if he would cease smoking the \nsubstance as a condition of employment, he stated, \u201cyes.\u201d  (Gov 5a at 2)   \n \nApplicant disputed the polygrapher\u2019s assertion that he used marijuana \napproximately twice a year from 2013 to January 2014.  Applicant testified there were a \nnumber of statements reflected in the report that were not factual or were taken out of \ncontext. (Tr. 59-61) On October 17, 2016, the other government agency denied \nApplicant access to SCI. (Gov 5a)  \n   \nOn February 23, 2017, Applicant submitted an e-QIP. He listed that he used \nmarijuana on two occasions in February 2014 and January 2016. On both occasions, he \nwas on vacation with friends. Marijuana use was legal in the state where he vacationed \nwith friends. Applicant later indicated in response to the question regarding future use \u201cI \nnow understand that was in violation of a federal statute by doing so.\u201d (Gov 1, section \n23) \n \nIn response to Section 25 \u2013 Investigations and Clearance Record on the same e-\nQIP application, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to \u201cHave you EVER had a \nsecurity clearance eligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?\u201d  He \nexplained: \n \nI smoked marijuana in a state where it was considered legal, while not \nrealizing that I was violating the terms of my clearance given the federal \nnature of the action. I made it clear that if my employment status was \ncontingent upon not smoking marijuana I would refrain. I have also \ncompletely refrained (January 2016) since I became aware that I violated \nthe terms of my clearance.  \n \n(Gov 1, section 25)  \n  \nApplicant has not used marijuana since January 2016.  He is not a habitual user. \nHe claims all marijuana use occurred with friends while on vacation in a state where \nmarijuana was legalized in 2013. He provided a statement on October 25, 2018, \nindicating that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future and is aware that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n(Tr. 39; AE A, exhibit 3)  \n \n\n5 \n \nApplicant no longer attends his friends\u2019 annual vacation. He avoids situations \nwhere friends may use marijuana. Applicant testified that he was not addicted to \nmarijuana. His marijuana usage never created problems in his life. He believed it was \nlegal to use marijuana in the state where he was on holiday and only partook in the \nmarijuana that was being passed around at the house where he and his friends were \nstaying before they went out to dinner. If he was informed that marijuana use remained \nillegal under federal law, he would not have used it.  (Tr. 36-37, 42-45, 71 ) \n \nWhen asked why he was surprised to learn that marijuana was illegal under \nfederal law in his 2017 background investigation, Applicant testified: \n \nThere are - - you hear constant stories in the media about what is and is \nnot legal, factual. There is so much conflicting information. And by the \nway, as my OPM investigator said to me, there is so much conflicting \ninformation out there that there is not a clear story as to what\u2019s legal, \nwhat\u2019s not, and as with any element of life, things constantly evolve and \nchange. And, as I understood, that is the case.  (Tr. 62-63)  \n \nApplicant is remorseful about his marijuana use. He would never have used \nmarijuana had he known the seriousness of his actions. He does not believe any of his \nfriends would pressure him to use marijuana again. His family, several of his closest \nfriends, and some of his colleagues at work are aware of his past marijuana use. His \nmarijuana use cannot be used to blackmail him. (Tr. 36, 49-50; AE 3 at 10)  \n \nThe Facility Security Officer (FSO) of Applicant\u2019s employer (FSO A) testified \nduring the hearing. He is a vice-president of administration and also serves as the FSO \nas an additional duty. The company has 21 people who have or need security \nclearances. In 2015, he trained to be an FSO by taking online training offered by the \nCenter for Defense Security Excellence. During the online self-paced training, FSO A \nclaims there was no discussion about the use of marijuana and the impact on security \nclearances. He never told Applicant about the adverse consequences of using \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Tr. 72-77)  \n \nFSO A claimed he only learned there was an issue about using marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance after Applicant told him about it after his background \ninvestigation interview. The Defense Security Service (DSS) sends out monthly e-mails \nabout high-level facility security updates and changes in policy. FSO A cannot recall any \nof the e-mails containing information about the use of marijuana while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 73-77)   \n \n \nFSO A is familiar with the SF 86.  He is aware that the questionnaire contains \nquestions regarding illegal drug use. If an employee came to him and told him of their \nmarijuana use, he would file an incident report. He testified he is required to report the \nuse because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. He is aware of that the policy \nregarding marijuana use has not changed. He never told Applicant or employees of the  \ncompany that it was okay to use marijuana. He is aware of the statutory law on a federal \ndrug-free workplace. He is aware that employees are subject to urinalysis. Applicant \nnever came to him to inquire about the use of marijuana, how it relates to federal law, or \n\n6 \n \nthe affect it would have on his security clearance. He does not recall if he received any \nupdates on DoD policy regarding the state legalizations of marijuana and how it affects \nfederal law.  (Tr. 78-86)     \n \nWhole-Person Factors \n \n \nMr. M. met Applicant through a young leader\u2019s business association. Applicant \nhas been the leader of the organization over the past five years. Mr. M. is the president \nof a $6 billion privately-held company and holds a top secret security clearance. He \nbelieves Applicant is worthy of holding a security clearance because of the tremendous \nvalue his company provides to the U.S. government. If his privileged access is removed, \nit would be harmful to his business and its over 130 employees.  He strongly \nrecommends Applicant be allowed to maintain a security clearance. (AE A, exhibit 4)  \n \nMr. A. is a long-time friend, neighbor and associate of Applicant\u2019s. He describes \nApplicant as \u201can astute and responsible professional\u201d and a wonderful father and \nhusband. They have been neighbors for seven years. They attend the same church, \nhealth club as well as social events. Applicant\u2019s reputation is \u201cimpeccable.\u201d He is highly \nregarded in the community. He describes Applicant as a loyal U.S. citizen who \npossesses the necessary judgment to be trusted with matters of national security. He is \na man of high integrity and good moral character. (AE A, exhibit 5)  \n \nNumerous business colleagues of Applicant provided favorable comments about \nApplicant on his Linkedin page. (AE A, exhibit 1)  \n  \n \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use  \n \n  \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d  \n \n  \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana.  \n    \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24:       \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \nAG & 25(a) any substance misuse; \n \nAG & 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and  \n \nAG & 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position.  \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana once in 2014 and \nonce in 2016, both times while on vacation with friends in a state where marijuana use \nis legal. AG & 25(a) and AG & 25(c) apply.  His use occurred while he held a security \nclearance. AG & 25(f) applies.  \n  \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n9 \n \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n  \nAG & 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last use \nof marijuana. At the time of use, Applicant believed his conduct was not illegal, because \nthe state legalized the use of marijuana. He was unaware that marijuana use remained \nillegal under federal law.  Applicant disclosed marijuana use on several security \nclearance applications in 2013, 2014, and 2016 while in a state where marijuana use \nwas legal. Although there was an additional admitted use of marijuana in 2013 by \nApplicant that was not alleged in the SOR, I find the discrepancies in the number of \ntimes used to be minimal. Once he learned marijuana use was illegal under federal law, \nhe stopped using marijuana. Applicant has not used marijuana for over three years, and \nhe was forthcoming about his marijuana use, which shows trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant stopped using marijuana in January 2016, when he \ndiscovered marijuana use remains illegal under federal law even though it is legal in the \nstate where he used it. He was not a regular user. Although he attended the annual trip \nfor ten years, he stopped attending to avoid being around his friends who use \nmarijuana. He no longer associates with anyone who uses marijuana or any other illegal \nnarcotic, On October 25, 2018, he provided a signed statement of intent to refrain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. Applicant was truthful about his marijuana \nuse and demonstrated an appropriate pattern of abstinence.  \n \n \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. Applicant is warned that any future illegal marijuana use will result \nin the revocation of his security clearance.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n\n10 \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG & 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct , that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if know, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while entrusted with a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s past conduct raises issues about his judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. This raises doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nability to protect classified information.   \n \n \nAG & 16(e) applies because Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use has the potential to \naffect his personal, professional, or community standing. As a senior leader of his \ncompany, Applicant should have demonstrated better judgment when opting to use \nmarijuana even though it was legal in the state where he used it. He should have \nresearched whether there would be security concerns raised when using marijuana \neven in a state where marijuana was legalized.   \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \nAG & 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n\n11 \n \n \nAll above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used marijuana because it was \nlegal under the state law. He was not aware that it was illegal under federal law. Upon \nlearning it was illegal under federal law, Applicant immediately stopped using marijuana. \nHe no longer attends the annual trip where the marijuana use occurred. Applicant was \nhonest about his marijuana use and once he understood that his marijuana use was an \nissue, he stopped. He has not used marijuana in three years.  He was not addicted to \nmarijuana. He learned a difficult lesson, and his past marijuana use no longer casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant.  \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his failure to look into \nwhether marijuana use in state where it was legalized would raise a security concern. \nHaving held a security clearance since 2008, he should have known better. There is \nsome evidence that he was told during a 2015 background investigation interview that \nmarijuana remained illegal under federal law, yet he used marijuana in January 2016.  \n \nI find the mitigating reasons outweigh the disqualifying reasons in Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  His honesty in disclosing his marijuana use during the security clearance process \nsupports that he is trustworthy. At the location where he used the marijuana it was legal \nunder state law.  Once he understood that marijuana remained illegal under federal law \nand was incompatible with holding a security clearance, he stopped using marijuana \nand has not used marijuana for over three years. He signed a statement of intent to \nrefrain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any \nfuture substance misuse would result in the revocation of his security clearance. \nApplicant is a successful businessman who is highly regarded among his peers. He is a \nfamily man. He and his wife have three children.     \n \n\n12 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson.  Having been denied access to SCI in October 2016, he learned from his \nmistake in judgment and took steps to demonstrate his intent to refrain from illegal \nmarijuana use. Concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use are mitigated. \nApplicant is warned that any future illegal marijuana use will result in the revocation of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  Applicant is warned \nthat any future use of illegal substances will result in the revocation of his security \nclearance.  \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C.

Based on a \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for a position of trust is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 8, 2018, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nits file of relevant material (FORM) on August 23, 2018. Applicant received it on \nSeptember 19, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. The \n01/16/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted responses to the FORM on October 17 and 18, 2018 (Reply). Items \n1 through 8 and Applicant\u2019s Reply are admitted into the record, without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 8, 2019.                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, with explanations. \n(Answer.) The allegations are supported by credit reports dated November 21, 2017, and \nJune 7, 2018. (Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant is 23 years old. She is single and resides with her mother to save money. \nShe was enrolled in classes from June 2013 to May 2014 at a university, and then \ntransferred to a college in October 2015. As of July 2016, she was still enrolled in classes \nat the college. She worked part time as a clerk in a discount retail store from November \n2014 to present. Prior to that, she was an unemployed student. (Reply; Answer; Item 4; \nItem 7.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a lease agreement in the amount of $5,771, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. This debt was for student housing while attending the university and became \ndelinquent in 2014. Initially, she did not realize that this loan was separate from her \nstudent-loan accounts addressed below. However, when she realized it was a separate \ndebt, she contacted this creditor and set up an arrangement to pay $150 monthly until \nthis debt is resolved. She provided the name of her point of contact and a phone number \nto verify her payments under the agreement. While she did not provide documentation of \npayments under this agreement, she appears to be resolving this debt. (Reply.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on three student-loan accounts held by the same creditor in \nthe total amount of $10,547, as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. These loans became \ndelinquent in 2016 and 2017. Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with this \ncreditor to resolve these delinquencies through monthly payments of $149. She did not \nestablish a repayment agreement until after receiving the SOR, because she originally \nthought that he mother was repaying this debt. She documented that she has made six \nmonthly payments according to this agreement. These debts are being resolved. (Reply; \nItem 7.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $369, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. This was a credit card account that became delinquent in 2016. Applicant \nsettled this debt for less than the balance due, as documented in a May 2018 letter from \nthis creditor. It is resolved. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is addressing her delinquent debts as best she can with the funds that \nshe has available. She lives \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d but is dedicated to resolving her \ndebts in full. (Reply.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant was delinquent on three student loans, a lease agreement, and a credit \ncard in the total amount of $11,022. Her oldest debt has been delinquent since 2014. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns. I \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, including the following: \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has resolved her credit card debt, and documented that she is making \npayments on her three student loans. She has made six payments under that agreement. \nWhile she failed to document payments on the lease, she provided contact information to \nverify her payments and credibly averred that she is paying that debt. There is evidence \nof mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), with respect to these debts. \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Appeal Board has \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating:  \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every \ndebt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates \nthat he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably \nconsider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2 (a) \n(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.1 \n \n                                                 \n1ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant was young when she incurred the alleged delinquencies and relied on \nher mother to manage her finances. She has since matured and began addressing her \ndelinquent accounts. She provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a plan to resolve \nher outstanding delinquent debts within the standard defined in the above case. The \nlikelihood that financial problems will recur, or Applicant will stop making payments on the \nplans she has initiated, is minimal based on her efforts to date and her knowledge that \nsimilar problems could jeopardize her employment. The potential for pressure, coercion, \nor duress is eliminated by Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debt. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for \na position of trust. She met her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant                    \n                    Subparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n         Subparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n         Subparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. \nNational security eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nJennifer Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He has not taken any substantial affirmative action \nto resolve more than $20,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 1, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on January 26, 2018, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 19, 2018. He admitted the nine \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. In addition, he provided a brief explanation that he was currently \nworking on repaying his overdue creditors by paying off the smallest debt first and then \nmoving to the next, and he stated that he would present proof of payment at the \nhearing.   \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on May 15, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on May 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 19, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5 and A, respectively. \nApplicant relied on his own testimony and called no other witnesses. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 26, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nat a higher level than previously granted to him in 2008. (Tr. 7) He is employed as a \nsystem administrator for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed \nsince November 2015; he transferred to his current location in July 2016. He was \ninitially hired at an annual salary of $65,000; he received a promotion when he \ntransferred to his current location; and his current annual salary is $78,000. He works in \ndirect support of a military organization located on a military installation. His formal \neducation includes an associate\u2019s degree from a technical institute awarded in 2004. He \nhas never married, but he and his longtime fianc\u00e9e have a ten-year-old child.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes three periods of unemployment during \n2012-2015. (Exhibit 1) He worked as an assistant systems administrator from May 2008 \nto August 2012, when he was laid off. He was out work for about two months. (Tr. 25) \nHe accepted a job as a systems administrator in support of a contract that required him \nto live and work in Afghanistan. He worked overseas until about May 2014 when the \ncontract ended. He was then out of work for about three months, from May 2014 to \nAugust 2014. During that time, he enjoyed spending time with his family, including two \ntrips to Hawaii to visit family. He returned to work as a system administrator in August \n2014 and had that job until September 2015, when he was laid off. He was then out of \nwork for about two months, from September 2015 to November 2015, when he began \nworking for his current employer. Other than those three periods, Applicant has had full-\ntime employment in his field since at least June 2006.  \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of nine delinquent \naccounts, in collection or charged off, in amounts ranging from $88 to $10,593 for a total \nof about $21,674. The two largest debts, for $10,593 and $6,158, stem from automobile \nloans that ended in repossession resulting in deficiency balances. None of the nine \ndelinquent debts are medical collection accounts. Applicant admitted all the SOR \n\n \n3 \n \nallegations in his answer to the SOR and during his hearing testimony. In addition, the \ndelinquent debts are established by credit reports from 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Exhibits \n2-5). None of the nine delinquent debts were paid, settled, entered into a repayment \narrangement, forgiven, cancelled, or otherwise resolved. (Tr. 31)  \n \nOverall, Applicant attributed his financial problems or difficulties to unemployment \nand the expenses associated with providing for his fianc\u00e9e and young child. He \naccepted the job in Afghanistan, where he earned more than $100,000 annually, not \nincluding a substantial bonus, in order to focus on reducing his student loan debt. (Tr. \n25, 35-36) He stated that he reduced the balance from about $40,000 to $11,000. (Tr. \n35) The most recent credit report from September 2018 shows a balance of $19,818 \nwith $0 past due. (Exhibit 5) Applicant described his current financial situation as living \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 44) He estimated a checking account balance of $1,000 and \na savings account balance of $0. (Tr. 37-38) The September 2018 credit report shows a \nnew collection account for $680 stemming from an apartment lease. (Exhibit 5; Tr. 36-\n37) \n \nIn September 2018, a few days before the hearing in this case, Applicant \nretained the services of a firm that specializes in credit repair and optimization. (Exhibit \nA; Tr. 27-29) He pays a monthly fee of $100 for the service. His goal is to restore his \ncredit to good standards.  \n  \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is in a difficult situation dealing with a large amount of indebtedness \nwith a number of creditors or collectors. His problematic financial history is traceable to \nthree relatively brief periods of unemployment during 2012-2015. One of those periods \nalso served as rest and recreation after returning from his job in Afghanistan. The job \nlayoffs and periods of unemployment were circumstances largely beyond his control. He \nused the additional income he earned working in Afghanistan during 2012-2014 to \nattack the large balance on his student loan, which was not unreasonable.  \n \n \nNevertheless, what is missing here is obvious; namely, Applicant failed to take \nany substantial affirmative action (\u201ca good-faith effort\u201d) to resolve the nine delinquent \ndebts for more than $20,000 in the SOR. Not even the smallest collection account for \n$88 was paid. This lack of action occurred despite his full-time employment since \nNovember 2015, and earning a decent income ranging from $65,000 to $78,000 at \npresent. His action in September 2018 in retaining a credit-repair firm cannot be \nconsidered a good-faith effort at this time. It is an initial step in the right direction, but it \nis too soon to tell if it will result in either a large or small reduction of his indebtedness. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate \nthe security concern stemming from his long-standing history of financial problems, \nwhich is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The action was taken under DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within \nthe DOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on March 1, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) scheduling the hearing on August 8, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 2 and \n09/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2018. \n \n \n \n                   .    \n \n  \nApplicant is 55 years old. She graduated from high school in 1980. She has been \nemployed as a team lead for support staff at a federal contractor since 2007. (Tr. 10) \nApplicant married in 1985 and divorced in 1995. She has a 28-year-old daughter.   \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that she used marijuana (MJ) twice in section 23 of her May \n12, 2017, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing, also known as her \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). She testified that she smoked MJ on her \nhouseboat on a lake over the July 4th weekend in 2016 when a cigarette-joint was \nprovided by her boyfriend. (Tr. 14-16) It was Applicant\u2019s opinion that MJ should be \nlegalized. So, she thought she would try it to see what she was promoting. The MJ \ncigarette had no discernible effect on Applicant. (Tr. 16) She continues to see her \nboyfriend approximately once a week. (Tr. 17) Applicant attended a Christmas evening \nparty in  2016 with the same boyfriend, and somebody provided hard candy laced with \nMJ. Applicant ingested the candy. Again, it had no impact on her. (Tr. 18) She did not \npurchase the MJ on either occasion.  \n \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations under Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Applicant admitted both allegations in her Answer to the SOR, \nincluding SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleged that she used MJ, from about July 2016 to August \n2017, while holding a position of trust. She testified that she did not even think about her \nfederal position of trust when she used MJ, and it was just \u201cbad judgment.\u201d (Tr. 20) It is \nunclear that Applicant understood that use of illegal drugs was prohibited by her public \nposition of trust before she completed the SCA in May 2017. Applicant explained that \nwhen she filled out the SCA, it then became obvious to her that such illegal drug use \nwas a concern to the federal government, based on the questions in section 23 of the \nSCA. (Tr. 22-23) She answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about any intentions to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. Applicant was aware that her employer maintained a drug-free \nworkplace and required her to have a drug screen as part of the in-processing when she \nobtained her job as a team-lead for support staff in 2007. (Tr. 22) \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she used MJ with her boyfriend a third time in August \n2017, after she completed the SCA and became aware of the government\u2019s concern. \n(Tr. 24) Again, it occurred on their houseboat on the lake when her boyfriend \nencouraged Applicant to try a stronger MJ cigarette to see if it would have any \nphysiological impact. (Tr. 24) It did not, but it does impact her eligibility for a public \nposition of trust. Consistent with her answer in section 23 of the SCA, Applicant testified \nthat she has no intention to use MJ again in the future. (Tr. 21) She also completed a \n                                                          \n2 Unless otherwise indicated, these facts were taken from Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as a security clearance application (SCA) dated May 12, \n2017 (GE 1), and the summary of Applicant\u2019s enhanced subject interview conducted on October 19, 2017 \n(GE 2). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhand-written statement at the hearing to the effect that she agreed to abstain from all \nfuture use of MJ subject to revocation of her public position of trust if she violated this \nagreement. (AE A) Applicant testified that her boyfriend is not a frequent MJ user and \nshe admits she made \u201ca bad choice\u201d and learned a valuable lesson. (Tr. 34) She never \nused MJ until age 54, and used it fewer than five times total. (Answer)  \n \n \n        \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set \nout in AG \u00b6 24:   \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \n    or holding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant deliberately ingested MJ three times in the presence of her boyfriend. \nThe third time was after she became aware of the government\u2019s concern that this was a \nbreach of her public position of trust. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable \nsince she intended to ingest the MJ while holding a public position of trust.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n\n \n5 \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse   is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \nApplicant provided credible testimony that she believes MJ should be legalized \nand she wanted to experience the drug\u2019s effect. While she is not a habitual user, this \nwas not a one-time innocent ingestion. She testified that she has not completely \ndisassociated from friends, such as her boyfriend, who use illegal drugs. Although she \nsigned a statement of her intent to abstain from future use, she violated that same \nassurance when she re-offended after answering the questions in section 23 of her \nSCA. Since she used MJ as recently as August of 2017, there has been insufficient \npassage of time to confidently conclude that she will not violate again. I have remaining \nconcerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \napplicable, and AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant has served for 11 years as a team-lead for \n\n \n6 \n \n \na federal contractor. She self-disclosed her MJ use, and cooperated fully in the process. \nYet, in her own words she exercised bad judgment and made a mistake, learning a hard \nlesson.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug use remains a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:                         Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. \nThe record was held open to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence in \nmitigation, but no evidence was submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old firearms instructor, employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2017. He graduated from high school in 2004. He married in 2005 and \ndivorced in 2007, and has one 11-year-old child. He served in the Army National Guard \nfrom 2003 until being honorably discharged in 2009. Applicant held a security clearance \nfrom 2004 to 2009. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on three debts totaling approximately \n$40,000; defaulted on a mortgage and the home was foreclosed in 2013; and failed to file \nFederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. The SOR allegations \nare supported by substantial evidence. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after he divorced in 2007. He incurred sole \nresponsibility for a child-support obligation, home mortgage and other expenses. He was \nunable to make the mortgage payments, defaulted in about 2008 and the home was \nforeclosed in 2013. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) No deficiency is owed and his credit report no longer \nshows the debt.  \n \nOther debts include a $39,633 car loan that was reported in his 2017 credit report \nas $2,192 past-due. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant stated that he used the loan payments to pay \nfor trips to visit his ill father from 2017 until he passed away in 2018. He testified that he \nwas eight months behind in payments and owed about $32,000. He did not have an \nagreement to resolve the delinquent account. Applicant claimed that he paid two small \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, in February or March 2017 with a debit card.

He \ntestified that his divorce resulted in increased expenses, child support, and an inability to \nmeet the mortgage payments. He also attributed his inability to pay debts such as his car \nloan, on the need for the money to attend to his father. His reasons for not filing income-\ntax returns when due is less clear.  Applicant has known of his debts and the need to file \nincome tax returns for some time, but has not taken action to address them. In addition, \nhe testified that he owes past-due taxes. He has not provided a financial statement to \nshow his current financial status, and he has not taken action to resolve his tax issues. \nTwo small debts he claimed to have paid are no longer reflected in his latest credit report, \nand are presumed to be resolved. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to tax obligations, and the car \nloan is particularly concerning. He showed an inability or unwillingness to engage his \ncreditor and the IRS to resolve these accounts. He has not sought financial counseling, \nand has not disputed his debts or the amounts owed.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has not adequately addressed his delinquent debt and \ntax obligations, nor has he shown the financial responsibility expected of security \n\n \n6 \n \nclearance applicants. I find insufficient evidence that his financial status is under control \nand that similar problems are unlikely to recur. No conditions apply to mitigate his \ndelinquent tax obligations and car loan. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and personal difficulties do not overcome his history of financial irresponsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) \nfor all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided an incomplete response to the SOR on June 20, 2018, and \nelected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In an email \nfrom the DOD CAF, dated July 11, 2018, he was asked to supplement his response by \n02/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nadmitting or denying the SOR allegations. By email dated July 12, 2018, he admitted both \nallegations.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 13, \n2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 21, \n2018. His response was undated. It was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on September 17, 2018. Department Counsel did not object to \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and it is admitted into the record. In his response to \nthe FORM, Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, which was attached \nto Department Counsel\u2019s FORM as Items 1 through 6. In his September 2018 FORM \nresponse, Applicant updated his comments from his November 9, 2017 background \ninterview with his current views on the use of illegal drugs. He also provided a signed \nstatement in which he agreed to the revocation of his security clearance in the event he \nhas any future involvement with illegal drugs. This document has been marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. This evidence as well as the Government\u2019s six exhibits are \nadmitted into the record. The Government\u2019s evidence is referred to herein using \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s numbering for each Item. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 30, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the two allegations made under Guideline \nH and set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b.

He began his first full-time job in June 2016 working \nfor a government contractor.  \n \n \nOn August 30, 2016, he submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In the \nSCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana during the period 2012 to April 2016. He \ndisclosed that he had used the drug infrequently, and that he had used it less than 50 \ntimes. He also disclosed that he had used cocaine twice, both times in the months after \ncollege and before he began his job. He reported that he had no intent to ever use cocaine \nagain.  \n \n \nIn his November 9, 2017 background interview, he confirmed his marijuana use \nwhile in college and admitted that his last use of the drug was in the preceding month, \nOctober 2017, over one year after he submitted his SCA.

(Item 6 at 7.) \n \n \nIn September 2018, Applicant responded to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM by \nstating at length his changed view on his use of marijuana. He wrote that following his \nNovember 2017 background interview, he had reconsidered his priorities and decided to \nno longer use any marijuana. His last use was, as stated to the investigator, in October \n2017. He elaborated that he had decided that his old views on using marijuana were \nimmature and inconsistent with his career plans. He explained that he has cut ties with \nfriends who he had smoked marijuana with and kept his distance from anyone using \nmarijuana. He also emphasized that in September 2017 he had entered into a serious \nrelationship with a woman who does not tolerate any drug use. She also has encouraged \nhim to work hard to meet his goals, which includes abstaining from any drug use. As \nnoted, he also signed a written statement that he has no future intent to use illegal drugs \nin the future.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \npotentially disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 25(a) (any substance misuse (see above \ndefinition)). \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline H are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s last illegal use of a controlled substance \noccurred after he submitted his SCA and less than one year before his response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM. This period of abstinence suggests that the behavior may \nnot recur, but is not long enough to establish that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s choice \nto waive a hearing gave me no opportunity to assess his sincerity in committing to abstain \nfrom using marijuana in the future. Also, the recency of his last use of marijuana continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability and judgment. The fact that he first expressed his change \nin attitude about marijuana use after he received Department Counsel\u2019s FORM in August \n2018 also supports this conclusion.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has established a pattern of \nabstinence, however, he continued to use marijuana after submitting his SCA and has \nonly abstained after being advised by an investigator that he could not qualify for a \nclearance if he continued to use marijuana in the future. It is well established, however, \nthat \u201cdrug involvement after having completed an SCA draws into serious question the \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations, insofar as \n[the SCA] placed the applicant on notice of the consequences of such misconduct.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017) citing ISCR Case No. 14-03450 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015). As noted, the period of his abstention is insufficient to constitute \na pattern of abstention. Applicant has represented that he has taken steps referred to in \nthe three subparagraphs of this mitigating condition. Without a longer period of \nabstinence, however, it is too early to conclude that these steps will be sufficient to ensure \nthat Applicant will continue to abstain from illegal drug use. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). In particular, I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s young age at the time he smoked marijuana and the fact that he was in college \nfor much of the period of his use of marijuana. I cannot conclude, however, that these \nfactors provide sufficient mitigation under the facts of this case largely because \ninsufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana. Applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to establish mitigation, and his evidence, without appearing in \nperson at a hearing, fell short of meeting that burden.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nand Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 21, 2016. \nOn March 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines E and F.1 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The Defense \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on July 31, 2018, and the \nhearing was convened on August 28, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, but did not \nintroduce any documentary evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old industrial engineer for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2004.  Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1983 and a master\u2019s degree in \n1985. He married in 1978 and divorced in 1987, and married in 2002 and divorced in \n2015. He has one adult child. He has held a DOD security clearance for 32 years. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant met a woman online that he \nhas not met in person, and borrowed and sent approximately $65,670 to her in Nigeria. \nAs a result, Applicant became delinquent on financial obligations and filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in 2016. The bankruptcy is pending a final discharge. These \nallegations are cross-alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations, and provided explanations in his Answer. \n \nApplicant divorced from his second spouse in October 2015, incurred responsibility \nfor nearly all of the marital debt, and gave up about half of his bank assets and retirement \nfund. His household income was reduced once his spouse left. At the same time, \nApplicant believed he was providing financial assistance to a woman, \u201cK,\u201d whom he met \nthrough an online dating site. K was supposedly an American citizen traveling to Nigeria \nfor business. Applicant never met K, but spoke with her in two short phone calls, and often \ntexted with her from 2015 to 2018. During this period, K provided many requests for \nApplicant to send her cash, including problems with getting medically cleared to leave the \ncountry, visa issues, etc. Applicant wanted to help her, so he began sending money via \nWestern Union. In the summer of 2016, Western Union suspected fraud, and prohibited \nhim from sending money to Nigeria with their service. Applicant then used Money Gram \nuntil they refused to continue to send money, also suspecting fraud. Applicant resorted to \nbuying $100 gift cards and sending them to K on his own. Next, K directed Applicant to \ndeposit money into U.S. bank accounts in other people\u2019s names. At first, Applicant sent \n$10,000, but was required to complete a federal financial transaction form for the bank. \nTo avoid completing the form, he sent no more than $6,000 at a time. Applicant borrowed \nabout $69,000 in loans to send to K in Nigeria, and sent another $100,000 over time. \n \nApplicant became delinquent on his mortgage loan and other debts, causing him \nto declare bankruptcy and file a Chapter 13 case in 2016. The Chapter 13 requires a five \nyear payment plan, to be completed in 2021. Applicant declared about $115,000 in debt.  \n \nK was aware of Applicant\u2019s financial distress and bankruptcy, but continued to \npress him for money. He stopped sending cash at the end of 2016 on the warning of his \nbankruptcy attorney, but continued the relationship to the summer of 2018, even after \nreceiving the SOR. Applicant told K where he worked and his job title. However, Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \nnever notified his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO), law enforcement, or the dating \nwebsite of the fraud scheme, even by the time of the hearing, but he testified that he is \nconsidering it. \n \nApplicant has not sought psychological counseling, but is considering using the \nservices provided by his employer. He was required to utilize financial counseling before \nfiling bankruptcy. Applicant described his actions with regard to K and his finances as \n\u201clack of good judgment.\u201d He stated he was emotionally involved, was in denial, and \nwanted to believe her. He ended the relationship after it became \u201cpainfully obvious\u201d to \nhim that it was fraudulent. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n\n \n4 \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \n\n \n5 \n \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation . . .  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (d), (e), and (g). \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant participated in the scheme to transfer money to a possible foreign \nnational was initially unwittingly, however, once money transfer companies began to \nquestion the transactions, he should have known that the scheme was likely fraudulent. \nHis inability to realize the fraudulent nature of the relationship early on, exposes a long \nseries of errors in judgment, and calls into question Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to \nsafeguard protected information. Although he has now acknowledged the relationship \n\n \n6 \n \nwas likely fraudulent, he continued to have contact with K long after he was notified of the \nlikely fraudulent nature of the relationship. He disclosed his employment and job title, and \nhas been reluctant to report the relationship to his employer\u2019s FSO, the dating website, \nor law enforcement. He has not sought counseling to assist him in preventing similar \nconduct in the future. Based on his significant loss of good judgment and secretive nature \nof his relationship, Applicant has not shown sufficient evidence of mitigation. I am not \nconvinced that this incident is behind him or that similar high-risk and irresponsible \nbehavior will not recur. No mitigation fully applies. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 18 (a), (b), and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in a thinly-veiled relationship to fraudulently extract money \nfrom him was at first unwitting; however, it quickly became apparent to be a fraudulent \nscheme with a possible foreign national. His continued involvement with borrowing money \nand transferring about $169,000 to a \u201cperson\u201d he never met invokes a significant degree \nof poor self-control, lack of judgment, and an intent to hide his relationship from \nappropriate authorities. His lack of financial control is troubling, and raises significant \ndoubts about his overall financial management decisions and personal financial \nresponsibility. I am not convinced Applicant is financially responsible or makes good \nfinancial decisions. No mitigation fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines E and F, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility. However, his involvement \nin the fraudulent relationship, borrowing money to send to an unknown foreign person, \nbankrupting himself to continue the scheme, and continued participation even after being \nwarned about the scheme and after receiving the SOR in this case, shows a complete \nlack of awareness and judgment expected of a person entrusted with classified \ninformation. I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility, good judgment, and \nability to resist further high-risk activity. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \n\n3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns under this guideline are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment, and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse.\u201d The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 26 is potentially \napplicable: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n  \nApplicant contends he will never use marijuana again. However, he did not \nmemorialize his intent not to use it again in a signed, sworn statement. Moreover, he \nprovided no information about whether he will disassociate himself from his marijuana-\nusing friend, or whether he will avoid the environment where marijuana is used. \nConsequently, AG \u00b6 26(b) is only applicable insofar as he acknowledged his history of \nmarijuana use and expressed an intent not to use in the future. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in December 2017, 18 months after he \ncompleted SCA. Under these circumstances, it is too soon to conclude that his \n                                                                                                                                                             \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n4 \n \nhistory of marijuana use no longer poses a trustworthiness concern. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the trustworthiness concern. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s falsification of his 2016 SCA triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant falsified his SCA because he was afraid he would lose his job if his \nemployer discovered he had been using marijuana. Intentionally omitting or falsifying \nrelevant information to conceal derogatory information from a trustworthiness application \nout of fear of losing one\u2019s job does not mitigate falsification.  None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct trustworthiness \nconcern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nposition of trust. Eligibility for a position of trust is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 52-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance. He works as a consultant in the fields of proposal management, capture management, and business development for various companies in the defense industry.

He married in 1999, and he and his spouse have two teenage children from the marriage. The SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In addition to his admissions, the six delinquent financial accounts in the SOR are established by the documentary evidence. (Exhibits 3-8) In particular, the SOR concerns a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of $3,890 with a total balance of $948,215, and five charged-off accounts in the total amount of about $64,433. Three of the charged-off accounts are credit card accounts, and two charged-off accounts are unsecured loans from peer-to-peer lending companies. In general, Applicant attributed his financial problems to circumstances surrounding his wife\u2019s mental-health condition (bipolar disorder) in 2016, and a business downturn in 2017 due to the transition of presidential administrations, leaving delays in large government procurement programs. His wife\u2019s mental-health condition is long- standing; the first undiagnosed manic episode occurred in 2007-2008; and she was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had court-ordered treatment in 2011.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.   \n \n \n08/29/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The conditions that resulted in his financial problems \nwere largely beyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nhas also initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this \ncase is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 1, 2016. (Exhibit 2) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 22, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on April 30, 2018. \nAlthough his formal responses were \u201cadmit in part and deny in part,\u201d he essentially \nadmitted the six debts alleged and provided explanations and current information. His \nanswer consisted of a seven-page memorandum along with proposed Exhibits A-R. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \non December 4, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-X. Other than Applicant, no \nwitnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 12, \n2018. \n \nThe record was kept open until December 14, 2018, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. Applicant made a \ntimely submission, and the three additional documents are admitted without objections \nas Exhibits Y, Z, and AA.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He works as a consultant in the fields of proposal management, capture \nmanagement, and business development for various companies in the defense industry. \n(Tr. 18-19; Exhibit C) His formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree from a \nprestigious private university. He married in 1999, and he and his spouse have two \nteenage children from the marriage.  \n   \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the six delinquent financial accounts in the SOR are \nestablished by the documentary evidence. (Exhibits 3-8) In particular, the SOR \nconcerns a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of $3,890 with a total balance of \n$948,215, and five charged-off accounts in the total amount of about $64,433. Three of \nthe charged-off accounts are credit card accounts, and two charged-off accounts are \nunsecured loans from peer-to-peer lending companies.   \n \nIn general, Applicant attributed his financial problems to circumstances \nsurrounding his wife\u2019s mental-health condition (bipolar disorder) in 2016, and a business \ndownturn in 2017 due to the transition of presidential administrations, leaving delays in \nlarge government procurement programs. His wife\u2019s mental-health condition is long-\nstanding; the first undiagnosed manic episode occurred in 2007-2008; and she was first \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder and had court-ordered treatment in 2011. (Tr. 53-54) \nHer most recent manic episode was in 2016. Her condition has stabilized since the last \nepisode with no further incidents, and she remains under the care of a psychiatrist. (Tr. \n43-44) \n\n \n3 \n \nThe 2016 episode resulted in, among other things, Applicant and his wife \nentering into a written partial marital settlement agreement in April 2016. (Exhibit AA) \nThe agreement summarized the relevant circumstances surrounding his wife\u2019s mental-\nhealth condition as follows: \n \nWHEREAS, the Wife has been hospitalized several times during the \nparties\u2019 marriage which has resulted in periods of marital separation, and it \nappears that in order for the parties to continue their marriage and to \ncontinue to reside in the same residence and to protect the safety of the \nchildren, the parties have agreed that a marital agreement is necessary for \nthem to live together as husband and wife. Specifically, [Applicant\u2019s \nspouse] suffers from significant mental illness. To date, she has been \nhospitalized (involuntarily and/or voluntarily) four (4) times since 2011. \nThis includes four (4) court supervised hospitalizations and multiple court \nsupervised medical treatment plans. Manic attacks preceded each of \nthese hospitalizations, and local law enforcement/crisis prevention \nauthorities deemed her to be a possible danger to herself or others. In two \n(2) of these hospitalizations, different medical teams have diagnosed her \nas having Bi-polar disorder with manic tendencies. \n \nAs \npart \nof \nthe \nmania \nprocess, \n[Applicant\u2019s \nspouse] \nhas \ndamaged/attempted to destroy personal property belonging to her family. \nFor example, in 2011, she destroyed office equipment used by her \nhusband and attempted to give away family possessions (including \nvaluable jewelry). And in 2013, she locked out her husband and children \nfrom their family home during another manic attack. Also, on or about in \n2008/2009, she also locked out her husband from the family home until \nlocal law enforcement were able to gain access to the house for the \nhusband. \n \nDuring manic attacks, [Applicant\u2019s spouse] has shown disregard for the \nsafety of family financial assets. For example, in 2011 she wrote a check \nfor $100,000 on the family account which if cashed would have bounced. \nIn 2011, she also tried to give away assets of the family to realize a \ndelusional vision of good fortune. And in 2013, she emptied out joint bank \naccounts, which created a dangerous situation for the husband and \nchildren who were at that point outside the home area. (Exhibit AA at 1-2) \n \nAmong other things, Applicant and his wife agreed that he has sole legal and \nphysical custody of their minor children and his wife had liberal access to the children so \nlong as she remains in the marital home. His wife agreed to continue treatment, follow \nall doctor\u2019s recommendations, and take all prescribed medications. She also agreed to \nhave no further contact with a named paramour or any subsequent paramour and cease \nall contact, direct or indirect, with such persons. Applicant and his wife also agreed that \nthey will have one joint checking or savings account with a particular bank and all other \njoint accounts will be closed.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIrresponsible spending was a feature of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s manic episodes. The \nindebtedness reflected in the five charged-off accounts in the SOR stems from her \nirresponsible spending with three credit card accounts, spending to pay for medical care \nand treatment for her, or both. Applicant has taken steps to reduce the likelihood of \nrecurrence of a similar event. (Tr. 46-47) To address the irresponsible spending, \nApplicant and his wife have one joint account, which allows him to monitor ongoing cash \nflow, and he has taken her off of all his business accounts. (Tr. 48-50) Together, they \nhave three bank accounts with the same bank; she has her own checking account; they \nhave a joint account; and he has an account for household expenses. (Tr. 50) Most of \nthe money is in the household account, which she does not have access to while he has \naccess and transparency for all three accounts. (Tr. 50-51) In addition to the financial \naccounts, his spouse does not have access to matters related to his work in the defense \nindustry. (Tr. 63-64)  \n \nTurning to the delinquent debts in the SOR, the first concerns the past-due \nmortgage loan for a home in their state of current residence. Applicant fell behind on the \nloan due to a tenant defaulting on his rental obligation while Applicant and his family \nwere living and working in another state during 2014-2017. (Tr. 25-32) The tenant made \ntwo payments on a 24-month lease before defaulting and eventual eviction. In addition \nto the lack of a monthly rental payment, which was used to cover the mortgage \npayment, the tenant damaged the property to an extent that the cost to repair and \nrehabilitate the home was about $40,000.  \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant entered into a repayment plan agreement for the \nmortgage loan, which then was past due in the amount of $12,028, with a payment \nschedule calling for six monthly payments ending in September 2018. (Exhibit M)  \n \nIn October 2018, the mortgage lender agreed to extend the plan for another six \nmonths ending in March 2019. (Exhibit W) As of October 2018, the past-due amount \nwas $5,376.  \n \nA November 16, 2018 account statement reflects the following: (1) the amount \ndue on December 1, 2018, was $16,043; (2) the unpaid principal balance was \n$905,116; (3) past payments year-to-date include $12,994 in principal, $13,685 in \ninterest, $9,174 in escrow, and $2,668 in unapplied funds, for a total of $38,552; and (4) \nthe current amount due consisted of $1,463 in principal, $1,501 in interest, $1,127 in \nescrow for a monthly payment of $4,092, plus a past-due amount of $11,951. (Exhibit Z)  \n \nA December 8, 2018 account statement shows an unpaid principal balance of \n$903,661 with a past-due balance of $12,059. (Exhibit Y) Applicant anticipates the \nmortgage loan will be current by approximately March 2019. (Tr. 31) \n \nTurning next to the charged-off accounts, the $23,957 charged-off credit card \naccount was settled in 2017, when Applicant agreed to make two payments totaling \n$13,954, and a pending collection lawsuit against Applicant was dismissed with \nprejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 32-36; Exhibit N) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe $17,051 charged-off credit card account was settled in 2017, when Applicant \nagreed to make 12 monthly payments of $1,222 ending in October 2018 for a full \nsettlement amount of $14,675. (Tr. 36-37; Exhibits O and U) \n \nThe $13,323 charged-off unsecured loan was settled in 2018, when Applicant \nagreed to make three payments for a total of $4,000 ending in May 2018. (Tr. 38-39; \nExhibit P) \n \nThe $8,866 charged-off unsecured loan was resolved by a repayment \narrangement calling for $100 monthly payments beginning in October 2017. (Tr. 39-41; \nExhibits Q and V) The account has not been settled for a lesser amount, and Applicant \nintends to adhere to the payment arrangement until the account is paid.  \n \nThe $1,236 charged-off credit card account was settled in November 2017 for a \nlump-sum payment of $1,512, and a pending collection lawsuit against Applicant was \ndismissed with prejudice in early 2018. (Tr. 37-38; Exhibit R)   \n \nApplicant is a high-earner, averaging about $20,000 monthly in billable revenue. \n(Tr. 42)  A self-prepared financial statement shows the following: (1) monthly income of \n$15,000; (2) monthly expenses of $8,090; (3) monthly debt payments of $3,332; and (4) \na monthly net remainder of $3,578; and listed assets (excluding real estate) of \n$263,000. (Exhibits K and S) In addressing his indebtedness to recover from the 2016 \nincident, Applicant has followed a four-step plan: (1) relocating to their current home \nand state of residence in mid-2017, which resulted in a reduced cost-of-living; (2) \nfocusing on the key accounts to obtain settlements; (3) establishing a three-month \nfinancial reserve, which is still a work in progress; and (4) paying off their current debt \nby the spring of 2020, all of which would result in a full recovery. (Tr. 41-42) In addition \nto the above matters, Applicant had credit counseling from a consumer credit \ncounseling organization in April 2018. (Exhibit J)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \n                                                          \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to a \ncombination of factors: (1) his wife\u2019s last manic episode in 2016, her related \nirresponsible spending, and expenses for her care and treatment; (2) the business \ndownturn in 2017; and (3) the tenant who defaulted on the lease and damaged their \nhome while they were living and working in another state. Those circumstances were \nlargely beyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, as \nevidenced by the remedial actions taken in 2017 and 2018 to address his indebtedness. \nHe also acted responsibly by taking steps to rehabilitate his marriage and care for his \nspouse, protect his minor children, and prevent his spouse from engaging in further \nirresponsible spending. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nApplicant has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to resolve his \nindebtedness. He receives substantial credit for addressing all the debts in the SOR. \nThe past-due mortgage loan is still past due, but Applicant has paid tens of thousands \nof dollars on the loan during 2017-2018, and he anticipates being current on the loan by \nMarch 2019. He also paid a total of $34,141 to settle four of the five charged-off \naccounts, and he is making monthly payments per a repayment arrangement for the \nother. Moreover, it does not appear that Applicant was slow to act. He has being \nworking on these matters since the mid-2017 relocation to his state of current \nresidence. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \n\n \n8 \n \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and repay his creditors. He\u2019s not running from or avoiding his debts. There \nare clear indications that he is repaying his creditors, and his financial problems appear \nto be under control. With additional time coupled with his ability as a high-earner, it is \nprobable that he will continue to make the required mortgage loan payments and \nadhere to the repayment arrangement for the unresolved charged-off account. It is also \nprobable that he will meet his financial goal of full recovery by spring 2020. Taking \neverything into account, Applicant demonstrated good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness by persevering under difficult and trying circumstances that were largely \nbeyond his control. The financial considerations concern is mitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a--1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Edmunds. Esq. \n     11/08/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant exercised seriously poor judgment by misusing a controlled substance \nto curb her appetite so that she could become pregnant. However, the passage of time \nand her credible medical evidence in mitigation is sufficient to overcome the remaining \nsecurity concerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nEligibility for classified information is granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn June 30, 2016, Applicant certified and signed an Electronic Questionnaires \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for \nemployment with a defense contractor. On October 7, 2016, Applicant provided a \nsummary interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office Personnel Management \n(OPM). After examining the background investigation and PSI, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings to issue a security clearance. \nOn March 1, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under misuse of prescription drugs (Guideline H, \u00b6 1) and personal \nconduct (Guideline E, \u00b6 2). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \n\n \n  2 \n \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), made effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 14, 2018, and requested a hearing. I was \nassigned the case on July 28, 2018. On March 28, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing for April 15, 2019. The \nGovernment\u2019s two exhibits and Applicant\u2019s 15 exhibits were admitted without objection. \nOn April 30, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.); the record closed the \nsame day.  \n \nRulings on Evidence \n \n \nBefore opening statement, the Government moved to withdraw \u00b6 2 (Guideline E) \nof SOR. The motion was granted. (Tr. 5) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted misuse of prescription drugs as \nalleged under \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. She married in May 2015 and gave birth to a daughter \non August 26, 2017. She has owned her home since March 2011. In May 2003, \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in history; in August 2004, she earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in cultural studies; and in May 2009, she was awarded a law degree. \nFrom 2009 to September 2010, she clerked for a federal district court judge. She was a \nlaw firm associate for three years before landing her current job in 2014 where she is \npresently a senior contract attorney. She is a member of two state bars. Applicant has \nnever been investigated or held a security clearance. She has no criminal record and \nthe only drug she has used in her life is Adderall. (GE 1 at 9-14, 22, 69, 72; GE 2 at 16; \nAE B; AE C; AE F; AE G; AE N at 2-3; AE O) \n \n \nIn her October 2016 PSI, Applicant indicated she used Adderall about two times \na month beginning in January 2016, when she was 34 years old. The controlled \nsubstance was prescribed to her brother for his attention deficit disorder. She began \ntaking the drug to curb her appetite. She indicated that the drug never had an adverse \neffect on her judgment, her work, or her finances. She informed the OPM investigator \nthat she intended to continue using the drug unless required to stop to obtain a security \nclearance. (GE 2 at 16) \n \n \nIn her interrogatory answers dated and notarized on February 9, 2018, Applicant \nnoted several minor changes in her October 2016 PSI. She then disclosed that her \n\n \n  3 \n \ndaughter was born in August 2017. She also indicated that she used Adderall about 30 \ntimes from January 2016 to February 9, 2018. (GE 2 at 1-5, 16)  \n \n \nThough not mentioned in her October 2016 PSI or her February 2018 \ninterrogatory answers, she informed a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in April \n2019 that during her pregnancy and nursing of her daughter from December 2016 to \napproximately February 2018, she used no Adderall. (AE N at 2-3) \n \n \nThe LCSW conducted a full evaluation of Applicant in April 2019. For part of the \nevaluation, she administered the drug assessment screening test (DAST) to Applicant. \nShe conducted an examination using the 11-point screening criteria of Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). She conducted a mental status exam \nfollowed by a clinical interview. After referencing the AGs for security clearance \neligibility and reviewing the pertinent sections of the DSM-5, the LCSW diagnosed \nApplicant as having no substance abuse disorder. (AE N at 1-4) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that her obesity was the reason she started \nusing Adderall in January 2016. Over the next several months, she lost 70 pounds and \nbecame pregnant in December 2016. She indicated that she did not use Adderall during \nher pregnancy (December 2016 to August 2017) and while she was nursing her \ndaughter for the next four months. Applicant resumed her Adderall use in January 2018 \nbecause she wanted to lose weight again, a decision she regrets. She discontinued use \nin February 2018 \u201cbecause that\u2019s when I received the Government\u2019s Statement of \nReasons.\u201d (Tr. 33) (She is mistaken as the SOR was not issued until March 1, 2018.) \nApplicant did not know the drug was a controlled substance until a later date. (SOR; Tr. \n22-28; 33) \n \nThe circumstances in Applicant\u2019s life have changed since the birth and nursing of \nher daughter. She is no longer trying to lose weight to achieve pregnancy. She pledged \nnot to use Adderall or another person\u2019s prescription drugs in the future. Applicant\u2019s six \ndrug tests from October 2018 through March 2019 registered negative results. On \nDecember 11, 2018, she signed a statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of \nprescription drugs, realizing that future misuse of prescription medication is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. 22-28; AE L; AE M) \n \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist recalled that that she told him \nin August 2016 she was using Adderall though he was unable to conclude \u201cduring that \ntime\u201d or \u201csince that time\u201d that she was addicted to the drug. Applicant\u2019s weight loss \ndoctor, who she has been consulting occasionally for four years, discouraged her from \nusing Adderall. She has never tried to obtain a prescription for the drug from a medical \nprofessional. She has had some success with other prescribed weight-loss drugs, but \nstopped using one of those drugs because of the risk of birth defects. (Tr. 31-33, 35-38; \nAE K) \n \n\n \n  4 \n \n \nApplicant selected Adderall to control her appetite because somehow she knew \nthe drug could subdue hunger desires and she was aware her brother had a \nprescription for the drug. She did not know if the drug had any side effects or a negative \ninfluence on her fertility. (Tr. 36-37, 42-43) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fear of not being granted a security clearance was one reason she \nstopped using Adderall. However, when she received the SOR labeling her a national \nsecurity concern, she knew she had to strengthen her resolve for continued abstinence \nfrom Adderall misuse or misuse of another\u2019s prescription drugs. (Tr. 37)   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague (Mr. R3) at her current employer testified that he has been \nworking with Applicant for three years. In his daily contact with her, he has found her to \nbe very professional and a trustworthy attorney. Applicant expressed her remorse to Mr. \nR3 for having used Adderall that was prescribed to her brother. She was trying to lose \nweight so that she could become pregnant. (Tr. 11-19)  \n \nApplicant submitted nine character references. A program manager (Mr. R1) has \nknown Applicant since 2011 because they worked together on government contracts at \na law firm until she accepted her present job in 2014. Applicant\u2019s professionalism and \ntrustworthiness is based on Mr. R1\u2019s regular interaction with her. Mr. R2 has known \nApplicant for nine years and believes that she is a diligent worker. Mr. R3, corporate \ncounsel who testified at the hearing, indicated that Applicant is involved in a \nneighborhood charity that provides scholarships to worthy candidates from the area. \n(AE H; AE J) \n \nMr. R4, a contractor, has known Applicant professionally and socially for four \nyears. He believes she is a knowledgeable member of the government contractor \ncommunity. Ms. R5 has known Applicant since they were in law school in 2006. Ms. R5 \nand Applicant have maintained friendship over the years. Mr. R6, an associate law \nschool professor, was a law clerk with Applicant in 2009. They have remained friends \nwith Mr. R6 and Applicant socializing often. (AE H) \n \nMr. R7, who has known Applicant for five years, worked with her for a period of \ntime at her current employer. He found her to be honest, dedicated, and a team player. \nMr. R8, currently a police officer, worked with Applicant at her employer\u2019s industrial \nsecurity office. He personally observed her trustworthiness and high caliber of her work \nproduct. (AE H) \n \nMrs. R9, a lawyer, has known Applicant since 2012, when Mrs. R9 was hired at a \ncontracts law firm, and Applicant was assigned to be her adviser. Applicant\u2019s mentoring \nhelped Mrs. R9 manage her time  more effectively and stimulate her professional \ndevelopment. Applicant is an honest person, a responsible wife, and attentive mother. \n\n \n  5 \n \n(AE H) None of the nine glowing character endorsements, not even the reference from \nMr. R3, make any reference to Applicant\u2019s misuse of prescription drugs.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \n \nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant misused Adderall, a schedule II \ncontrolled substance (stimulant) as defined 21 United States Code (U.S.C.) 802. By \n\n \n  6 \n \nobtaining the drug that was prescribed to her brother for his attention deficit disorder, \nApplicant misused a legal drug in a manner inconsistent with the drug\u2019s intended \npurpose.  \n \nApplicant began misusing Adderall in January 2016 at a frequency of about twice \na month. After reporting her history of misuse during an October 2016 PSI, she \ninformed the OPM investigator that she would continue to misuse Adderall unless she \nwas required to stop to receive a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant continued to misuse Adderall until December 2016, when she became \npregnant. After the birth of her daughter in August 2017, and a four-month period of \nnursing, she resumed misuse of the drug in January 2018, and used the drug until \nFebruary 2018. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n\n \n  7 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies in part because Applicant\u2019s substance misuse is unlikely to \nrecur. I find that Applicant no longer has a reason to use Adderall because she has \ngiven birth and knows that she can curb her appetite and weight with other prescription \ndrugs as she has in the past. Additionally, she did not know the drug was a controlled \nsubstance.  \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation from AG \u00b6 26(b) because she provided \ncredible testimony of her intention not to misuse prescription drugs in the future. Her \nintention is supported by her responsible decision to self-report her substance misuse to \nthe OPM investigator, her abstinence from substance misuse since February 2018, and \nher signed statement of intention to forego future misuse of prescription drugs.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) applies in part because Applicant wanted to have a baby and her \nweight was preventing her procreation. Applicant does not receive full credit under the \ncondition because after she completed nursing she again used poor judgment in \nresuming misuse of Adderall.  \n \nWhile Applicant has not completed a substance abuse program, she did undergo \na comprehensive evaluation by a LCSW in April 2019. After administering a DAST, an \n11-point evaluation under the DSM-5, a mental health status exam, a clinical interview, \nand assessing the AGs for security clearance eligibility, the LCSW diagnosed Applicant \nas having no substance abuse disorder. AG \u00b6 26(d) applies in part. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n  \nApplicant provided positive evidence that weighs in her favor. She is 38 years \nold. She has been married for four years and has a young daughter. She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, and a law degree. Since her graduation from law \n\n \n  8 \n \nschool, she has developed a respected reputation from former and current coworkers \nfor her intelligence, team player attitude and professionalism.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in October 2016, she \nexercised good judgment by volunteering her Adderall use before being questioned \nabout any drug abuse or misuse. But then she displayed poor judgment by announcing \nthat she planned to continue using the drug unless the use prevented her from receiving \na security clearance. Even though she did not know the drug was a controlled \nsubstance, she knew (at ages 34-36) that she was misusing a drug prescribed to her \nbrother. She continued using the drug until she became pregnant in December 2016, \nand resumed use for a short period in early 2018, after a four months of nursing. \n \nJudging by the totality of all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s fear of not receiving \nsecurity clearance eligibility was a critical consideration in her decision to stop using \nAdderall. However, her subsequent understanding of the drug\u2019s classification as a \ncontrolled substance, along with the impropriety of using another person\u2019s prescription \ndrugs, were two other factors that caused her to stop. I find that there has been no use \nof this drug since February 2018. In April 2019, following a complete diagnostic \nevaluation encompassing alcohol tests, and a clinical interview, the LCSW found no \nsubstance abuse disorder that is recognized by the DSM-5. Considering the evidence \nas a whole, particularly the favorable character and medical evidence, Applicant has \novercome the security concerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n___________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On April 20, 2018, after reviewing the application and \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland,  sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a \nhearing. \n                                                          \n1  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of \nDefense  Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on June 8, \n2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on January 24, 2019. The hearing was held as \nscheduled on April 5, 2019. After the hearing and receipt of the transcript, I proposed to \nthe parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nDepartment Counsel had 10 days to consider the matter and provide written notice that \nDepartment Counsel did or did not object to the summary disposition. On April 29, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel forwarded an e-mail to the parties, indicating they had no objection \nto the summary disposition.   \n \nThe SOR consisted of two allegations. SOR 1.a alleged Applicant\u2019s grandmother \nis a citizen and resident of Syria. SOR 1.b alleged Appellant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen \nand resident of Syria. She admitted both allegations.  \n \nApplicant has worked for a DOD contractor and has held a security clearance \nsince July 2013 without incident. Her co-workers attest to her excellent work ethic and \nthe positive contributions that she makes to the work environment. (AE A; AE B; AE E) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the United States in the late 1980s and \nbecame U.S. citizens in 1991. Their two children, Applicant and her brother, were born, \nraised, and educated in the United States. Applicant\u2019s parents both served as DOD \ncontractors and have been granted security clearances in the past. After 9-11, her \nfather volunteered to deploy to Iraq in 2003. He served as a linguist and cultural advisor \nto several of the top generals for 22 months. Her father is currently a DOD contractor \nand holds a top secret clearance. (Tr. 20-38; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant met her husband in the United States. He attended medical school in \nSyria, but moved to the United States in 2011 to complete his residency. At present, he \npractices medicine in United States. He became a U.S. permanent resident in February \n2018 and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible. They married in \nOctober 2016, and Applicant recently gave birth to their first child, a son. They intend to \nlive in the United States. Their financial assets are located in the United States. \nApplicant votes in the United States. (Tr. 40-43, 66-78; Gov 2) \n \nSOR 1.a:  Applicant has limited contact with her grandmother because her \ngrandmother does not speak English and Applicant is not fluent in Arabic. She has \ncontact with her a few times a year during the holidays such as Christmas and Easter. \nFrom 1994 to 2015, her grandmother was a permanent resident in the United States. In \n2013, she returned to Syria to sell some property.  Her chronic illness worsened and \nshe became too ill to travel to the United States. As a result, her permanent residency \nexpired. Her grandmother is 83. She has a 24-hour caregiver and cannot feed herself. \nShe has never worked outside the home. (Tr. 27-30; 69) \n \nSOR 1.b: Applicant has met her father-in-law but has limited interaction with him \nbecause of the language barrier. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law currently lives part of the year \nin Syria and part of the year in the United States.  He is 78. He served in the military as \na result of a military draft.  He retired in January 2001.  His wife passed away in \nSeptember 2001.  He has five sons. Applicant\u2019s husband is the youngest. Three of his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nolder sons are medical doctors. Two work and reside in the United States with their \nfamilies and are U.S. citizens. His eldest son practices medicine in Canada. He and his \nfamily are French and Canadian citizens. He and his family recently moved to the U.S \nbecause he accepted a research position.  Another son resides in Germany with his \nfamily.  He owns a restaurant in Syria. He hired someone to oversee the restaurant in \nSyria. He travels to Syria several times a year to check up on the restaurant. He would \nlike to open a restaurant in Germany. (Tr. 45-63) \n \nBetween 2003 and 2014, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law visited his sons in the U.S. for \nextended periods.  He became a permanent resident of the U.S. in March 2018.  He is \nin the process of selling his property in Syria and will move to the United States to live \nwith his family once the sale of the property is complete. At the time of the hearing, he \nwas living with one of his son\u2019s in the United States. (Tr. 48-56; AE G) \n \n \nWhile Guideline B security concerns were appropriately raised related to \nApplicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Syria, the concerns are mitigated  \nbased on Applicant\u2019s longstanding connection to the United States.  In reaching this \nconclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and concluded the favorable evidence \noutweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also considered the factors under the whole-\nperson concept. I conclude Applicant met her ultimate burden to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s family members living and residing in Syria do not \ncreate doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a \nwhole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. This case is decided for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on April 23, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 13, 2018, and \nreassigned to me on July 26, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August \n14, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called a \nwitness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted \nwithout objection.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2005. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1983 \nuntil he was honorably discharged in 1987. He has worked for defense contractors for \nabout 30 years. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held for many \nyears. He attended college for a period without earning a degree.

His mother and a sibling both passed away within the last \nfour years. He also admitted that he \u201cwas not watching the shop as closely as [he] \nshould have and things got out of hand.\u201d2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a $29,231 federal tax lien; two unpaid judgments totaling \n$17,233; and eight delinquent debts. However, the $15,621 delinquent debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is the underlying debt for the $16,621 judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Additionally, \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k are duplicate accounts. The six non-duplicate debts \ntotal about $38,700.  \n \n \nThe IRS filed a $29,231 tax lien against Applicant in 2016.3 IRS tax transcripts \nobtained in November 2018 show the following: \n \nTax Year \nAdjusted Gross Income  \nBalance (with interest and penalties) \n \n2010  \n \n$190,872 \n \n \n \n \n$6,154 \n2011  \n \n$190,324 \n \n \n \n \n$4,965 \n2012  \n \n$212,065 \n \n \n \n \n$22,122 \n2013  \n \n$189,183 \n \n \n \n \n$11,926 \n2014  \n \n$180,249 \n \n \n \n \n$23,819 \n2015  \n \n$181,062 \n \n \n \n \n$47,619 \n2016  \n \n$67,815 \n \n \n \n \n$0 \n2017  \n \n$73,406 \n \n \n \n \n$0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal:  \n$116,6064 \n \n \nApplicant would have received refunds from tax years 2016 and 2017, but $1,713 \nfrom tax year 2016 and $1,231 from tax year 2017 were withheld and transferred to his \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17, 20-21, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 17-19; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE L. \n \n4 AE L. The SOR alleges the tax lien was filed in 2016, but it does not specify the tax years. The above \ntable includes amounts owed for years that were not included in the tax lien and therefore not alleged in \nthe SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may \nbe considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and during the whole-person analysis. \n\n \n3 \n \nliability for tax year 2010. The amount owed of $6,154 for tax year 2010 is after the \ncredits for tax years 2016 and 2017 and a $1,162 payment made on May 18, 2018. \nExcept for the taxes withheld from his paycheck, those are the only payments made to \nthe IRS for tax years 2010 through 2015 since 2013.5 \n \n \nAll of the non-tax debts are in payment plans or otherwise resolved. Since March \n2017, Applicant has paid $5,473 to the creditor for the $16,621 judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nreducing the amount owed to $10,667. He paid $400 to the creditor for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.j, reducing the amount owed to $1,340. The $18,887 defaulted student loan has \nbeen reduced to $16,985. He paid $406 to the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, \nreducing the amount owed to $2,620.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is working again. He testified that he planned to resolve his \nfinancial problems. His wife filed a lawsuit. They hope to use part of the settlement or \njudgment to pay their debts. He also considered using a home-equity loan. He has not \nreceived formal financial counseling, but he has hired tax professionals to help him \naddress his tax problems.7 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 23-27; AE L. \n \n6 Tr. at 27-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4; AE A-K, M-O. \n \n7 Tr. at 17-19, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE F. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, judgments, \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are duplicate accounts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k are also \nduplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h \nare concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems primarily to his wife losing her job in \n2013. His mother and a sibling both passed away within the last four years. He also \nadmitted that he \u201cwas not watching the shop as closely as [he] should have and things \ngot out of hand.\u201d  \n \n \nAll of the non-tax debts are in payment plans or otherwise resolved. While he still \nowes an extensive amount on all of those debts, I believe he will continue to address \nthose debts, and they are mitigated. However, his tax problems precede his wife losing \nher job and the tragic loss of his mother and sibling. He owes the IRS more than \n$116,000 for tax years 2010 through 2015.  \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the \nsecurity concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 3, 2016. \nOn February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \nalleging \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on February 28, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nApril 26, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on August 3, 2018. On February 26, \n\n2 \n \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for April 3, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D were admitted without \nobjection. I left the record open until April 17, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through H, which I have \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old lab manager currently employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2010. He has worked as a defense contractor and held a security clearance \nsince 1996. He has worked as a first responder since 1998 and is now a sergeant in the \ncounty rescue squad. He has been awarded numerous commendations for his volunteer \nservice, including two citations from the state General assembly. (AX G.) Applicant and \nhis wife married in 1995. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges eight past-due accounts totaling $29,492. \nApplicant admits seven of the accounts and denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nThe delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from April \n2018, December 2017, and February 2017. (GX 2; GX 3; GX 4.)  \n \nApplicant and his wife historically struggled financially due to low-paying jobs. \nApplicant worked for his previous employer from 1996 until 2010. He started as an hourly \nemployee earning $5.90 per hour. By 2010, Applicant had worked his way up to the \nposition of lab manager where he earned $27 per hour, grossing approximately $56,000 \nannually. Applicant\u2019s wife previously worked for the same employer, at a lower hourly \nrate, until she was laid off in 2010. She was unemployed for approximately six months, \nuntil beginning part-time work for the contractor who employs Applicant. This period of \nunemployment and underemployment created financial strains for Applicant\u2019s household \nprompting Applicant to sell his vehicle to help make ends meet. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant\u2019s \nwife has since gained full-time employment. Applicant and his wife earn a combined gross \nsalary of approximately $130,000, of which Applicant earns approximately $86,000. (Tr. \n38-40; Tr. 42-43.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent financial issues arose from unanticipated financial \ndemands. Applicant\u2019s mother, who lived in Florida, died in 2014. The obligation of \nwrapping up his mother\u2019s affairs fell to Applicant. He had to make multiple trips to Florida, \nand incurred travel-related expenses. Because he was frequently away from home, \nApplicant\u2019s wife took over the responsibility of managing the household finances. She \nwas inexperienced at handling the accounting and was delinquent in paying several \naccounts. (Tr. 21.) \n \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s death, his father became overwhelmed. Applicant \nprovided financial as well as emotional support to his father. Within months of his mother\u2019s \ndeath, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was stricken with cancer. She was no longer able to \n\n3 \n \nperform her job. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s income was unreliable. Applicant and his wife \nprovided financial support for her mother. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant and his wife are no longer \nfinancially supporting any family members. (Tr. 56-58; Tr. 70-72.) \n \nApplicant and his wife incurred significant medical expenses between 2008 and \n2009. During this period, it was also discovered that Applicant\u2019s wife had cancer that \nsubsequently required extensive surgery and treatments. They primarily used a dedicated \ncredit card to pay the medical expenses. (Tr. 44-46.) The account first became delinquent \nin 2013 and has since been charged off in the amount of $11,065. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant \nalso took two personal loans through this same creditor which have since been charged \noff in the amounts of $2,091 and $1,901 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. Since 2016, \nApplicant made sporadic payments to this creditor, usually in increments of $50. Applicant \nentered a repayment agreement with this creditor in March 2019 which addresses the \nthree delinquent accounts. The creditor automatically withdraws $250 a month from \nApplicant\u2019s checking account. (Tr. 45-46; AX C; AX D.) These debts are being resolved.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant returned to college. In order to finance his tuition and other \nexpenses, Applicant took out several student loans. These loans became delinquent and \nApplicant was past-due $304 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $386 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $153 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The \ncreditor consolidated loans and Applicant has made sporadic payments since 2014 and \nincreasingly since 2016. His current balance is approximately $36,000. Applicant has \nbeen in discussions with the creditor in an effort to negotiate a monthly payment that is \nfinancially manageable for Applicant. The creditor is currently requiring a $2,000 lump-\nsum payment, which will be followed by monthly payments of $226. In the interim, \nApplicant has continued making payments whenever he is able. (Tr. 26-28.) These debts \nare being resolved. \n \nThe $3,362 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was for a credit account with a computer \ncompany where Applicant purchased a computer in about 2015. Applicant did not realize \nthat this account was delinquent. The original creditor sold the account to a collection \nagency that Applicant did not recognize as one of his creditors. However, he made a $50 \npayment to a collection agency. (AX C.) In March 2019, Applicant entered a repayment \nagreement with the monthly payment of $44 that is debited directly from Applicant\u2019s \nchecking account by the creditor. (AX A.) This debt is being resolved. \n \nApplicant denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The debt was owed for \ntuition for a college course that Applicant dropped. The debt was resolved in 2014 when \nthe state withheld Applicant\u2019s tax refund. The debt has not appeared on Applicant\u2019s CBRs \nsince February 2017. (GX 4.) This debt is resolved. \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased the land on which their house stands in 1996 and \nbuilt their house in 2006. Their mortgage-loan payment is $1,244 a month and is current. \nTheir second mortgage-loan payment is $942 month, which is also current. Applicant \nrecently made his final $810 payment for his vehicle and now has title. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ncar is paid off. Applicant lives within his means, to include the expenses for two dogs with \nchronic health issues. Applicant\u2019s second mortgage loan will be paid off in 2021 and his \n\n4 \n \nprimary mortgage loan will be paid off in 2025. Applicant purchased a recreational vehicle \nfor $18,000 in approximately 2016 using a 401(k) loan. He is current with his loan \npayments of $40 per pay period. Applicant has approximately $3,000 in his checking \naccount and approximately $60,000 in his 401(k). (Tr. 62; Tr. 59.) Applicant intends to \nuse the $810 a month that was previously allotted for his truck payment to make payments \non his other outstanding accounts. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \nApplicant did not understand the potential security significance of financial \ndelinquencies until his 2017 personal subject interview (PSI). Upon realizing the \nimportance of resolving any and all the delinquent accounts, Applicant contacted his \ncreditors and began making sporadic payments on his accounts when he was able. (AX \nB; Tr. 70-71.) Applicant now maintains a spreadsheet with the tickler system to alert him \nto when bills are due for payment. (Tr. 70-72; Tr. 62.)  In the event that Applicant changes \nemployers, he is eligible to cash out his unused leave which totals more than 360 hours. \nHe would use this money to pay down any remaining debts. (AX D.) Applicant has not \nincurred any recent delinquent debts. He was sincere and credible while testifying. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current direct supervisor of more than four years states that Applicant \nhas an amazing work ethic and that he is loyal, trustworthy, and an asset to the team. \nShe further states that he demonstrates integrity and that he should be granted access \nto classified information. Another of Applicant\u2019s supervisors, who frequently travels \nofficially with Applicant, states that Applicant should be granted a clearance and that he \ndemonstrates loyalty, trustworthiness, and integrity. (AX H.) Applicant received \noutstanding performance appraisals in 2017 and 2018. (AX E; AX F.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n5 \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n\n6 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n \nThe relevant mitigating conditions in this case are: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose due to conditions largely beyond his control. \nSpecifically, he worked at a low-paying job for 15 years, during which time his wife \nrequired expensive medical treatment and care. Applicant\u2019s wife was laid off from her job \nin 2010 and was unemployed for approximately six months then underemployed. \nApplicant acted responsibly by selling his vehicle. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s mother died and \nApplicant incurred extensive costs traveling to take care of her affairs and by providing \nhis father with financial assistance. Applicant and his wife\u2019s finances were also negatively \naffected after her mother was stricken with cancer in 2014, compelling them to provide \nfinancial assistance to her. Each time an unforeseeable financial crisis arose, Applicant \nacted responsibly. He sold his vehicle in 2010 to help cover expenses during his wife\u2019s \nunemployment and underemployment. He contacted his creditors and since 2016, has \nbeen making sporadic payments to each of his creditors whenever he was financially able \n\n7 \n \nto do so. He recently re-contacted all of the SOR creditors and entered repayment \nagreements with two of the three creditors. He is actively negotiating with the third creditor \nto enter a repayment plan for his outstanding student loans. Applicant no longer provides \nfinancial support to family members. He successfully disputed the tuition debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant currently lives within his means and has substantial savings in his \n401(k). He has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. Applicant has resolved or is \nresolving the SOR debts and it is unlikely that he will be unable to maintain his finances \nin the future. Applicant\u2019s past financial problems do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties did not arise under circumstances that suggest \nreckless or irresponsible behavior. Although Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, he has \nmade a good-faith effort to repay or successfully dispute his debts and has established a \nplan to resolve his financial issues within his means and to avoid future financial issues. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1996. He has worked as a first \nresponder since 1998. Applicant is trusted and respected by his supervisors and received \noutstanding performance reviews in 2017 and 2018. He was sincere and credible during \nhis testimony.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 52, is divorced and has one adopted adult daughter. He served in the United States Army Reserves for 28 years, and was deployed overseas. Applicant obtained his undergraduate degree in 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in 1992. Applicant completed his security clearance application on May 16, 2016. He has held a security clearance. (GE 1) He has worked for his current employer since 2016. From 2010 until 2015, Applicant worked abroad. (Tr. 24) He usually had four jobs to support the family. (Tr. 30) The SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $76,000. (GE 2, 3) The debts include a home equity loan, and three collection accounts. Applicant admitted one delinquent debt, which amounts to about $21,000. He provided explanations for each allegation. Applicant acknowledged his financial hardship. He takes responsibility and is attempting to correct the issues. (Tr. 14) He does not want to make excuses, but wants to clarify the situation. During the marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife was responsible for payment of all bills, and he did not own a checkbook, or a credit card. Applicant was divorced in October 2010.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 8, 2018, in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DoD issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR  \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 2, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for November 9, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits, which were marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A-V, and accepted into the record without objection. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I held the record open for additional documents. Applicant submitted four \n12/18/2018\n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments which were marked as AE ( W, X, Y, and Z), and admitted into the record \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 52, is divorced and has one adopted adult daughter. He served in \nthe United States Army Reserves for 28 years, and was deployed overseas. Applicant \nobtained his undergraduate degree in 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in 1992. Applicant \ncompleted his security clearance application on May 16, 2016. He has held a security \nclearance. (GE 1)  He has worked for his current employer since 2016. From 2010 until \n2015, Applicant worked abroad. (Tr. 24)  He usually had four jobs to support the family. \n(Tr. 30) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts in the approximate \namount of $76,000. (GE 2, 3) The debts include a home equity loan, and three collection \naccounts. Applicant admitted one delinquent debt, which amounts to about $21,000. He \nprovided explanations for each allegation. \n \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship. He takes responsibility and is \nattempting to correct the issues. (Tr. 14) He does not want to make excuses, but wants \nto clarify the situation. During the marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife was responsible for payment \nof all bills, and he did not own a checkbook, or a credit card.  Applicant was divorced in \nOctober 2010. A marital settlement agreement, dated October 12, 2010, required the \nparties to comply with certain provisions. (AE P) A relevant provision to this case concerns \nthe marital home. Under the terms of the marital settlement agreement, the marital home \nwas to be sold as soon as possible, and the wife shall reside in the marital home until it \nis sold. Applicant was to pay the mortgage and other costs for the home until the property \nis sold or one year from date of divorce. Before the divorce, Applicant did not have any \nfinancial issues. Applicant\u2019s wife agreed to pay the home equity loan and one-half of other \nexpenses. (AE P) \n \nApplicant signed and read the marital agreement, but he explained that he read it \nquickly before he was off to Germany for work. He did not recall the provision that \nobligated him to pay the home equity loan until the house was sold and other bills related \nto the house.  (Tr. 35) He stopped paying the mortgage in 2012. He did not think about \nthe house until he returned to the states in 2015.The house was not sold, and the broker \nwould not talk to Applicant. His wife resides in the home, and she pays the mortgage. (Tr. \n42) The house was for sale at one point in time, but it was not sold.  Applicant stated that \nhis wife does not want to move and that he is enlisting legal counsel to help bring about \na sale of the home. \n \nApplicant was candid and open when he stated that he did not understand the \nmarital agreement, but he knows now that he should have been more aware. He \napologizes for the mistake. He was not aware of a duty to pay  the home equity loan, and \nhe really does not know why. However, as soon as he learned about the financial issues \nwith the SOR, he agreed immediately to pay whatever was necessary to rectify the \n\n \n3 \n \nsituation. He is working two jobs and is making payments on the home equity loan and \nthe collection account. He is using legal means to enforce the sale of the home. Applicant \nand his ex-wife will use proceeds of the first mortgage to pay whatever debts remain on \nthe home equity loan. \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a., Applicant denied this allegation for a home equity loan in the \namount of $47,000, because as part of the marital agreement his wife was to pay the \nhome equity line of credit. He was abroad from 2010 until 2015, and he never was on \nnotice. He contacted the creditor and he was told that he is not the primary borrower on \nthe account and he received no information.  His wife still resides in the marital home. He \nnever knew that he was responsible for the home equity loan if the house was not sold. \nHe agreed to begin making payments on the home equity loan in the amount of $207 until \nthe house is sold. He submitted evidence that he is making payments and is current on \nthe equity loan. (Tr. 44; AE A, B, C, D, W) Applicant had sent his wife various amounts of \nmoney to help her pay the mortgage while he was in Germany. \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off credit account in the amount of $5,304, Applicant \ndenied the account as it was an account that he was not aware of. His ex-wife was to \nhave made payments. However, he negotiated a settlement payment. He had already \nmade several monthly payments before the settlement. (AE H, I) The settlement amount \nwas $2,025. (AE L) He had not been aware of the account before he received the SOR. \nIn fact, he did not have access to the credit card. However, he had agreed to make \npayments of $337.50. (AE H, I, J, W) He is current with the payments.  \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $21,472, Applicant made \npayments on this account until 2015. He never had access to the credit card. Since \nlearning about the account, he is making payments of $120 monthly. (AE K, L, M and W) \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant denied the debt because it has been paid in full. (AE \nN) It was for electric service while he worked in Germany. He presented documentation \nthat the bill is paid. SOR \u00b61.e is a duplicate of 1.d. (AE O) \n \nApplicant paid non-SOR debts that were joint accounts.  (Tr. 57) He also took a \nloan from his thrift savings plan (TSP) to pay other joint accounts.  Applicant \nacknowledged that he has made some mistakes. He and his ex-wife have agreed that \nproceeds from the purchase of the marital home will go toward the home equity loan. (AE \nG) \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $94,000. He submitted a financial statement. \n(AE V) Applicant is also working a second job on the weekends at an hourly rate of \n$19.95. He has a net monthly remainder of about $450. Applicant has no current \ndelinquent debts. Applicant also has a Veteran\u2019s monthly disability payment. He works \nwith a budget and has made several changes to his life style to cut expenses. (Tr. 96) His \ncredit report does not reflect any collection accounts. (AE Q) \n \n \n  \n\n \n4 \n \nCharacter References \n \nApplicant submitted awards, training certificates, and recognitions that he has \nreceived during his career. He also presented evaluations that reflect successful ratings.  \n(AE R, S, T, U, V) Each character letter attests to his good judgment and professionalism \nboth in the military and civilian world. Applicant performs at a high standard and has \nalways followed protocol. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \n\n \n5 \n \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are the result of circumstances beyond his control. Due to his \ndivorce and the ensuing marital agreement, Applicant had to pay certain amounts under \nthe marital agreement. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant is unlikely to put \nhimself in a similar situation. He is applauded for his good judgement in his career. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. While Applicant was abroad, he sent money to his wife \nfor the mortgage and he continued to send money after the first year. The house did not \nsell, and he had little control over that as he was working abroad. He acknowledges that \nhe did not understand, but should have, that he was responsible for continuing payments \non the home equity loan. He believed his wife was responsible for that, and he had no \nnotice that he owed any money. He was sincere and credible in his testimony. As soon \nas it became clear to him that the situation required him to pay the home equity loan and \ncollection accounts, he immediately addressed the issues. He has set up plans and has \npaid two debts, and settled one. He provided sufficient information that under the \ncircumstances he acted in good-faith and was responsible. He candidly admitted that he \nmade a mistake. He now has a track record of responsible payments.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are partially established. Applicant did not receive any \nformal financial counseling. He is making payments on the home equity loan and has \naddressed the other debts. He is back in the United States and will take any legal action \nnecessary to have the marital home sold. The proceeds will pay the mortgages. He has \nno delinquent debts at this time. He is current on his daily expenses. He is adjusting his \nlife style to save money. He has a good job. In fact, he is working two jobs to pay bills. \n \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR. For \nthese reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F  and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his credibility and openness at the hearing, and his many \nyears of military service, I conclude that Applicant presented sufficient information to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

As of the date of the hearing, she was attending college and expected to receive her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2022. She worked for a previous employer, a DOD contractor, from 2015 to 2016. She has worked for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2016. She became a team lead medical appointment coordinator in August 2017. She was unsure whether she has ever had access to sensitive information.2 Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to losing her job, in which she earned $20,000 annually, in August 2009, when she was pregnant with her second child. She was subsequently unemployed three times: from August 2009 to December 2012, May 2013 to September 2014, and July to October 2015.

She testified that she contacted the underlying \ncreditor, from whom she obtained the car loan, by telephone in approximately 2017, and \nwas told that they did not have any information because they placed the account for \ncollection. She testified that she then contacted the collection agency with the intention \nof making payment arrangements, but was told that they too did not have any \ninformation because the debt was older than seven years. She indicated that she \nattempted to obtain documentation from the creditor reflecting that the debts were \nduplicates, but she did not receive a timely response.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are for two student loans totaling $6,215 placed for collection. \nApplicant testified that she obtained these loans when she went to school. She testified \nthat her tax refunds were intercepted and applied toward the loans, and she paid the \nremaining $100 balance in November 2016. She testified that she was able to obtain \nfinancial aid to finance her schooling as of the date of the hearing. She provided \ndocumentation reflecting that both student loans were resolved as of December 2017.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a $22 state unemployment overpayment placed for collection. \nApplicant provided documentation reflecting that she paid this debt in November 2017.10 \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 32, 42-44, 59; GE 2, 3; AE A, F, H. \n \n6 Tr. at 32-33; GE 3; AE A, E. \n \n7 Tr. at 32-33, 59-60; AE A, D. \n \n8 Tr. at 33-34, 44-46; GE 1, 3; AE A, F, H. \n \n9 Tr. at 34-35, 60; GE 1, 3; AE A, B. \n \n10 Tr. at 35-36; GE 3; AE A, C. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j are for two parking tickets totaling $500 placed for collection. \nApplicant testified that she paid these tickets in around 2014 or 2015, and they are no \nlonger reported on her credit report. She testified that she registered her car with the \njurisdiction\u2019s department of motor vehicles (DMV) in 2018, and she provided \ndocumentation from the DMV website reflecting that she would not have been able to \ndo so if she had any outstanding tickets.11 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has been promoted twice since she started her \ncurrent job in July 2016. She earned $47,000 annually since August 2017, but suffered \na pay cut of $800 monthly in April 2018 due to a contractor change, which has impacted \nher ability to pay her bills. As of the date of the hearing, she had fallen behind on her \nrent of $1,095 monthly, as well as her gas and electric bill. However, she testified that \nshe was in communication with her landlord; she sought energy assistance for her \nelectric bill; and she was current on her $470 monthly payments for her car she \npurchased in February 2018, as well as her cellular bill. She was also looking for part-\ntime jobs to supplement her income. Her 2018 credit report does not reflect any \ndelinquent debts. She receives budgeting advice from her mother, but she has not \notherwise received financial counseling.12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s director of operations at her current job describe her as an excellent \ncommunicator, and an independent, organized, and detail-oriented worker. The director \nwrote that Applicant was responsible for supervising 10 medical appointment \ncoordinators in her section, and she did so efficiently and in a manner that led them to \nquickly become \u201csubject matter experts\u201d in their respective procedures and operations. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor of two years wrote that Applicant is a valuable asset, and her \ncontributions are mission-essential.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n                                                     \n11 Tr. at 35-36, 46-47, 60; GE 3; AE A, H. \n \n12 Tr. at 39-41, 48, 50-54, 56-59, 62-63; AE F, H. \n \n13 AE G. \n\n \n5 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nher circumstances. She credibly testified that she made efforts to resolve her delinquent \ndebts once she obtained stable employment in 2015, and she continued her efforts \nupon receipt of the SOR, in spite of the pay cut she received in April 2018.  \n \nApplicant provided documentation to show that she paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are not reported on her \nrecent credit reports from 2017 and 2018, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not reported on \nher 2018 credit report. She credibly testified that she disputed SOR \u00b6 1.a. I find that \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a duplication of SOR \u00b6 1.h, in light of Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that \nthe debt pertained to her car that she voluntarily surrendered in 2010, after she lost her \njob and gave birth to her second child. She also credibly testified that she attempted to \nresolve this debt with both the underlying creditor and the collection agency, but was \ntold that she could not do so since the debt was older than seven years. She also \ncredibly testified that she resolved the two parking tickets in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j, in light \nof her ability to successfully register her current car in 2018. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I was \nassigned the case on September 12, 2018.  \nA notice of hearing was issued on October 17, 2018, setting the hearing for \nDecember 6, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \n15 exhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-15. Applicant gave testimony and introduced one \nwitness. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 13, 2018. Based on the \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\ntestimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security \nconcerns under either guideline alleged. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old administrative assistant. She has worked on various \ngovernment contracts for over 25 years. She was first awarded a secret clearance in \n2008. Applicant was unemployed for about a month in 2007. (Tr. 25) Once earning \nabout $60,000 a year, she now only earns about $32,000 under her present contract. \nApplicant is a high school graduate who has completed some business school courses. \nShe has two middle-aged children and her spouse is deceased. At issue is \napproximately $37,000 in delinquent debts, and multiple theft-related offenses.  \n \nIn 2010 or 2011, Applicant had a gathering at her home. After it was over, she \ndiscovered her \u201cwallet and everything\u201d was stolen. (Tr. 13-14) The police would not take \na report because she had no idea who had stolen her wallet and there was no evidence \nof burglary. (Tr. 14) About three months later, she started getting calls about debts that \nwere not hers. She wrote some of the creditors to apprise them of the situation. She \nalso contacted some lending institutions with which she had bona fide debts.  \n \nIn addition, Applicant signed for both a truck and an apartment for a friend facing \nhard times. The individual lost their job and left Applicant with two additional balances. \n((SOR allegations 1.a ($17,689) and 1.b ($14,804)) Applicant learned that these debts \nwere delinquent in 2018, after her credit report was generated. (Tr. 30) In January 2018, \nApplicant spoke with both creditors and was told they would be willing to reach a \nsettlement, but no documentary evidence of such an offer or arrangement was \nintroduced. (Tr. 14, 29-30, 34) \n \nWith regard to the delinquent debts reflected in the SOR from 1.c-1.l, Applicant \nasserts they are the product of identity fraud, the result of the identity theft that occurred \nduring the above-referenced house party, although the evidence indicated the debt at \n1.f pre-dates that event. (Tr. 40-41) Given the circumstances, she denies responsibility \nfor the debts. (Tr. 15, 36-37) No formal disputes regarding these accounts have been \ndocumented. (Tr. 37-39) These debts amount to about $4,725, arranged in size from \n$57 to $1,438, and include debts for such things as cable service, telecommunications \nservice, and retail entities. \n \nThe SOR allegation at 1.m concerns a 1980 charge for four bad checks \n(misdemeanor) which led to a 60-day period of incarceration, suspended, and three \nmonths of probation. Applicant does not remember this incident and believes some of \nthese related citations may be duplicative. (Tr. 42) A November 1981 charge was \nentered for forgery (felony) and bad check (misdemeanor), leading to a sentence of 16-\n18 months of incarceration, suspended, and two years\u2019 probation. Subsequent charges \nfor bad checks were issued in 1982, 1995 (felony), and 1997, followed by a 2001 \ncharge of theft (misdemeanor) and shoplifting (misdemeanor). Overall, Applicant is \nconfused with regard to these allegations and any related specifics. (Tr. 43) Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnoted that these related debts must have been satisfied for, had they not been honored, \nshe would have been formally incarcerated. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant, however, had no \ndocumentary evidence regarding such payment to offer. \n \nIn March 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). She \ndeliberately answered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 25. Investigations and Clearance \nRecord \u2013 Government Debarment: \u2018Have you EVER been debarred from government \nemployment?\u2019\u201d In doing so, she failed to disclose she had been barred from competing \nin Office of Personnel Management (OPM) examinations or accepting appointments in \nthe competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, 1988. She similarly \ndeliberately answered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 26. Financial Record \u2013 \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts: \u2018Other than previously listed, have any of \nthe following happened? In the past seven (7) years, you had any possessions or \nproperty voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed? In the past seven (7) \nyears, you had bills or debts turned over to collection agency? In the past seven (7) \nyears, you had any account of credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed?\u2019\u201d This admitted denial was in contradiction to her answers in \nallegations 1,a, 1,d, and 1.l, above. \n \nIn addition, Applicant admitted she falsified material facts on an October 2010 \nSCA in answering \u201cno\u201d to \u201cSection 25. Investigations and Clearance Record \u2013 \nGovernment Debarment: \u2018Have you EVER had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked; or been debarred from government employment?,\u2019\u201d \nwhen she was, in fact, barred from competing in OPM examinations or accepting \nappointments in the competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, 1988. \n \nOn an August 2008 SCA, in response to \u201cSection 18. Your Investigations \nRecord: \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government \nemployment?,\u201d Applicant intentionally answered \u201cno.\u201d In doing so, she deliberately failed \nto disclose the fact she had been barred from competing in OPM examinations or \naccepting appointments in the competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, \n1988. \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant completed another SCA. She falsified facts in its \nexecution by answering \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 22. Police Record: \u2018Have you \nEVER been charged with any felony offense?\u201d\u2019\u201d Her falsity was based on her earlier \ncharges for bad check and forgery, noted above. A similar falsity was committed by \nApplicant with regard to the same question on a SCA from October 2010. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFive conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n                                                                                  \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, none of which were shown to be \nfully resolved or addressed. Many debts were the result of stolen credit cards or \nidentification left unsecured by Applicant in her home during a party. While this has the \npotential of raising AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant failed to offer documentation reflecting that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances to ameliorate the situation.   \n \nAs for addressing the created delinquent debts at issue, it appears some are \nattributable to personal identity information and credit cards that were left unsecured \nduring a house party, and to a reduction in pay. Applicant, failed, however, to show she \nacted responsibly at the time. Applicant stated that she has disputed some of her debts, \nbut she provided no documentary material substantiating that claim.  \n \nThere is no documentation reflecting Applicant has or is receiving financial \ncounseling. There is no documentary evidence showing that any of her multiple bad \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nchecks have been honored, although the fact she has never been formally incarcerated \nappears to indicate some degree of resolution was reached. Lack of documented \nprogress reflecting that Applicant has resolved her delinquent debts, brought them \nunder control, or otherwise resolved them does little to give rise to any of the available \nmitigating conditions. Consequently, none of the mitigating conditions apply.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant admitted making repeated falsifications on SCAs in 2016, \n2010, and 2008. These falsifications, omissions, or obfuscations concerned past \ndelinquent debts, a two-year debarment in the 1980s, and a past felony criminal record. \nBecause these misleading answers were intentional and deliberate, the following \ndisqualifying condition applies:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nI find that the false and omitted facts, which Applicant admits were intentionally \nput forth, were done so in order to set herself in a better light. While Applicant is no \ndoubt contrite, these admitted facts show a pattern that continued from 2008 through as \nrecently as 2016. Insufficient facts were introduced indicating the security concerns \nraised by these egregious falsities to mitigate security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old administrative assistant who has worked on various \ngovernment contracts for over 25 years. A high school graduate who has completed \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nsome college courses, she has had a secret clearance since 2008. Applicant was \nunemployed for about a month in 2007. Once earning about $60,000 a year, she now \nonly earns about $32,000 under her present contract. She is a widow with two middle-\naged children. She was subject to identity and credit theft at a house party she hosted \nseveral years ago, and believes, without corroborating documentation, that many of the \nSOR debts resulted from that incident.   \n \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence indicating she has implemented a \nplan to resolve her debts or made any progress toward addressing them. This includes \nmultiple bad checks, although the fact she was not incarcerated tends to indicate those \nmatters were somehow resolved. This process does not demand that an applicant pay \nall of one\u2019s delinquent debts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a \nworkable and manageable agreement and demonstrate by documentary evidence that \na meaningful track record of timely and notable payment has been established. Here, \nApplicant simply failed to provide any documentation regarding any efforts to resolve \nher delinquent debts. \n \nMoreover, as for the multiple admitted falsifications on her past few SCAs, \nApplicant provided no documentation tending to mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. In sum, Applicant failed to mitigate both financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He provided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate \nthe financial problems he encountered with a residential investment property, which \nresulted in a past-due mortgage loan that was eventually resolved by a foreclosure sale \nin September 2018. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 25, 2017.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on February 13, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \n1 Exhibit 1. \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2018. He admitted the sole allegation \nin the SOR, which concerned a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of about $18,000 \nfor a residential investment property known herein as the Lincoln Street property. He \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me August 3, 2018. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on October 10, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-6.  Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentary exhibits were admitted as Exhibits A-C. No witnesses were called other \nthan Applicant. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received October 19, 2018.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. After \nmultiple extensions of time, the record closed December 31, 2018. The e-mails from \nboth Applicant and Department Counsel as well as Applicant\u2019s post-heating exhibits are \nadmitted as Exhibits D-H.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He is employed as an information system security officer. He has worked for \nthe same company since 2016. He was unemployed for a four-month period during \n2016, but has otherwise been continuously employed as a federal contractor since at \nleast 2005. He is divorced with two teenage children who live with their mother in \nanother state. He owned and occupied a residential property during 1997-2009, and he \nhas since rented or leased a residence.  \n \nApplicant does not dispute a past-due mortgage loan and subsequent \nforeclosure sale of the Lincoln Street property. It was one of five residential investment \nproperties he bought in about 2005 or 2006. All five were located in the same large, \nurban city. Some properties he bought for cash at relatively low purchase prices (e.g., \n$12,000 and $14,000), while he financed the purchase of others. He purchased the \nLincoln Street property, a one-unit four-bedroom townhouse, with a mortgage loan of \nabout $75,000.   \n \nThe value of all five properties fell due to the historic bursting of the housing \nbubble.2 A new mortgage lender acquired the mortgage loan for the Lincoln Street \nproperty, and Applicant sought a loan modification without success in 2010.3 Applicant \nhoped the market would improve to allow a sale of the property, but its market value fell \n                                                          \n2 It is well known that the bursting of a real-estate bubble and the resulting credit crisis were important \nfactors in the 2007-2009 recession in the United States.  \n \n3 Tr. 28.  \n\n \n3 \n \nto about $50,000 and he could not find a buyer, so he decided to rent it.4 The property \nwas rented for about 2 years during an 11-year-period, although every rental \narrangement ended in eviction of the tenant.5 In the meantime, he kept paying on the \nmortgage loan and was unable to obtain assistance regarding a loan modification from \nthe mortgage lender.6  \n \nThe situation with the Lincoln Street property became more difficult in 2016, \nwhen Applicant lost his job and was unemployed for several months.7 As a result, he \nwas unable to make the monthly mortgage loan payment, and a foreclosure action was \ncommenced via a judicial proceeding in December 2016.8 Over the next 21 months or \nso a loan modification, short sale, and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure were attempted \nwithout success.9 The Lincoln Street property was sold in a foreclosure sale for $39,500 \nin September 2018. The report of sale filed with the court and other paperwork does not \nreflect a deficiency balance.10 At the hearing, Applicant was unware of a deficiency \nbalance, but thought he may owe real estate taxes on the property for the nine months \nhe owned it in 2018.11 In post-hearing submissions, he stated that he was told by the \nmortgage lender that he will receive a Form 1099 in January 2019.12 \n \nIn addition to the Lincoln Street property, Applicant had another problematic \nresidential investment property known herein as the Washington Street property.13 It \nwas not alleged in the SOR, but Applicant had an opportunity to discuss it during the \nhearing and he provided relevant documentation as well.14 He bought the house for \ncash for about $12,000 to $14,000 in 2005.15 The property was never occupied \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 29.  \n \n5 Tr. 29.  \n \n6 Tr. 30.  \n \n7 Tr. 30.  \n \n8 Exhibit 6.  \n \n9 Tr. 30-35.  \n \n10 Exhibit D.  \n \n11 Tr. 35-36.  \n \n12 Exhibits E, F, and G.  \n \n13 Exhibits A, B, and 5.  \n \n14 Because the Washington Street property was not alleged in the SOR, I did not consider it for \ndisqualification purposes. But I have considered it for two limited purposes: (1) it is part of the \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s investment portfolio, which was the source of his financial \ndifficulties; and (2) in evaluating the presence or absence of Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation.  \n \n15 Tr. 42; Attachment to Answer to SOR.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n(Applicant said \u201cit is just a shell\u201d),16 and he worked over the years and spent more than \n$120,000 to rehabilitate the property in order to obtain a use-and-occupancy permit \nfrom the city.17 His intention now is to sell the property.  \n \nGoing back to 2009, the city brought an action seeking an injunction, which \nresulted in a consent judgment against him for a vacant building notice on the \nWashington Street property.18 In 2012, he was found in contempt of court and a fine in \nthe amount of $14,400 was entered against him personally as the owner. Under that \nstate\u2019s law, a money judgment constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in \nland located in the county in which the judgment was entered. That meant the multiple \nproperties he owned in the same city were encumbered by the lien.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant spoke with a representative of the city about a possible \nreduction of the fine upon obtaining a new use-and-occupancy permit for the \nWashington Street property.19 In 2013, he applied for six permits, none of which had \nfinal inspections. Several years later in August 2018, Applicant spoke to the city to \nresolve the matter. The city proposed the following offer: once the Washington Street \nproperty passes inspection and is issued a new use-and-occupancy permit, the city will \nagree to accept half of the original contempt fine ($7,200) as payment and, upon receipt \nof payment, the city will submit a notice of satisfaction to the court. After further work \nand difficulties, Applicant met the terms of the city\u2019s offer, and the case was resolved as \nreflected in an order of satisfaction of judgment filed by the city with the court on \nDecember 28, 2018.20  \n \nOther than the matters discussed above, Applicant\u2019s current financial situation \nappears to be stable. A January 2018 credit report lists the past-due mortgage loan for \nthe Lincoln Street property, but otherwise lists no derogatory financial accounts.21 At the \nhearing, Applicant stated that he had about $26,000 in checking and savings \naccounts.22 He earns an annual salary of about $150,000.23 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n16 Attachment to Answer to SOR.  \n \n17 Tr. 42-43.  \n \n18 Exhibit A.  \n \n19 Exhibit B.  \n \n20 Exhibits E, F, and G.  \n \n21 Exhibit 3.  \n \n22 Tr. 65-66.  \n \n23 Tr. 64.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.24 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.25 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d26 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.27 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.28 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.29 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.30 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.31 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.32 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \n                                                          \n24 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n25 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n26 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n27 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n28 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .35 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and   \n                                                          \n33 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15 \n \n34 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n35 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history \nof financial problems. Obviously, the most significant circumstance was his investment \nportfolio consisting of multiple residential properties acquired during 2005 or 2006. In \nshort, it appears Applicant bit off more than he could chew. He became financially \noverextended due to the decrease in value of the properties and the various expenses \nassociated with ownership of multiple properties. Those matters were the source of his \nfinancial distress as opposed to a more typical financial case where an applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts resulted from consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or \nirresponsible spending.   \n \n \nConcerning mitigating conditions, Applicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nbecause his financial problems originated under usual circumstances (e.g., the bursting \nof the real-estate bubble) that are unlikely to recur. Because he resolved the \ndelinquencies on both the Lincoln and Washington Street properties, his history of \nfinancial problems does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \n \nApplicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), because the financial problems were \ncaused, at least in part, by circumstances largely beyond his control. He bought the \nproperties in 2005 or 2006, which was near the peak of the then real-estate bubble. \nShortly thereafter the real-estate bubble burst and he suffered the consequences of \nowning multiple properties that were declining in market value. The decline in value \nresulted in difficulties in refinancing or modifying loans, and some of the properties were \ndifficult to rent or sat vacant as he worked to make them suitable for rental. In addition, \nhe acted responsibly under difficult circumstances. He did not walk away from the \nproperties or declare bankruptcy. He held onto the properties and worked over a period \nof years to salvage his investment, which is evidence of long-term commitment and \nresponsible behavior.  \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is also applicable in Applicant\u2019s favor. He presented reliable \ndocumentation showing the past-due mortgage loan on the Lincoln Street property, \nwhich is alleged in the SOR, was resolved by a foreclosure sale in September 2018, \nshortly before the hearing in this case. He expects to receive a Form 1099-C in January \n2019, which is a record of a tax liability stemming from any cancellation of indebtedness \nby the mortgage lender. Given his salary and cash reserves, he should have no \ndifficulty in paying an income tax obligation, assuming one exists.  \n \n \nLikewise, he presented reliable documentation showing satisfaction of the \njudgment in December 2018 stemming from the fine imposed on him in 2012 for the \nWashington Street property. This matter was not alleged in the SOR. Obviously, \nApplicant took far too long to resolve this matter, which began in 2009 with the filing of \nthe consent judgment. But it is noted that Applicant was working with the city on this \n\n \n8 \n \nmatter in both 2012 and 2013, the property required various repairs and improvements \nalong with inspections and permits, and he had to pay the associated expenses from his \nnormal cash flow as opposed to relying on an unlimited source of funding. These things \ntake both time and effort to accomplish.  \n \n \nConcerning the good-faith standard in AG \u00b6 20(d), I am mindful of the copious \nAppeal Board caselaw on post-SOR remedial actions in financial cases. While it\u2019s true \nthat Applicant resolved both the past-due mortgage loan and the unpaid judgment after \nissuance of the SOR, it\u2019s also true that he worked on an on-again, off-again basis to \nresolve the issues with these two properties over a period of years that preceded the \nSOR. In other words, this is not a case where Applicant was engaged in massive \nprocrastination or simply ignored the problem and only took action upon receipt of the \nSOR. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I am satisfied that the totality of his \nremedial efforts were made in good faith and were not done simply in response to the \nSOR.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

At a date not in the record, Applicant \nrequested a conversion to a hearing. The case was assigned to me on September 12, \n2018.

Prior to the hearing on November 29, \n2018, I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. I \npresented Applicant with three options: (1) continue the hearing for another date to \nallow him additional time to prepare in light of the amended allegations; (2) proceed with \nthe hearing as scheduled, with the option of returning for a second hearing to address \nany additional matters, to include the amended allegations; or (3) proceed with the \nhearing as scheduled, with the option of keeping the record open to allow him the \nopportunity to provide additional documentary evidence. Applicant did not respond. At \nthe hearing, I reiterated my ruling concerning Department Counsel\u2019s motion. Applicant \nchose option three and we proceeded with the scheduled hearing. He also reiterated \nthat he wanted to have a hearing, rather than an administrative determination as \nindicated in his response to the SOR.2 \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through L, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, \nI kept the record open until December 21, 2018, for additional evidence. By that date, \nApplicant submitted additional documentation, which I marked as AE M through Q and \nadmitted in evidence without objection. \nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d to conform to the evidence. Without objection, I amended SOR \u00b6 1.c to replace \n\u201cApril 2014\u201d with \u201cOctober 2016,\u201d and SOR \u00b6 1.d to replace \u201cApril 2014\u201d with \u201cOctober \n2017\u201d.3 DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018.4 \nFindings of Fact \n5 \nApplicant was born in Guyana.

He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a DOD contractor, since November 2017. He was first granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in 2011.6 \nThe SOR alleges the following delinquent accounts: a $25,789 federal tax lien \nand a $5,303 state tax lien, both from 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o-1.p); five consumer debts \ntotaling $137,027 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.k); and seven medical accounts totaling \n$4,161 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j, 1.l-1.n). The SOR also alleges two mortgage foreclosures in \n2016 and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d). The debts and foreclosures are established by court \nrecords and credit reports from 2016 and 2017. Applicant also disclosed his debts in his \n2016 security clearance application (SCA).7 \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his family\u2019s moves, beginning in 2005, \nfrom state A to state B to state C. He did not receive correspondence as a result of his \nmoves, and he was unaware of a number of his debts, to include his wife\u2019s medical \nexpenses, until he received the SOR.8 \nThree months after moving his family from state A to state B, Applicant moved to \nstate C because he was unable to find comparable work in state B. He subsequently \nmoved his family to state C when it became too difficult for them to live apart. They \ninitially rented, and then they bought a home in state C in 2007. He rented his home in \nstate B, but the tenants did not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage so he was \nresponsible for paying the difference.9 \nIn 2008, the housing market crashed. In 2009, Applicant rented his first home in \nstate C and purchased another home in state C, because his first home was too small \nfor his family. He had three separate renters for his first home in state C; each of them \ndid not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage for that home, so he was responsible \nfor paying the difference. His last renters for his first home in state C eventually stopped \npaying their rent.10 \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s tenants moved out of his home in state B, and he was \nresponsible for the mortgages on his homes in both states B and C. He became \nunemployed for approximately four to six months in 2014 or 2015, and he supported his \nfamily with money solely from his savings and 401k retirement plan. In approximately \nOctober 2016, Applicant\u2019s second home in state C was foreclosed, and Applicant\u2019s \n6 Tr. at 29-38, 47-51, 116; GE 1; AE K. \n7 GE 1-7. \n8 Tr. at 37, 50, 52-59, 61-66, 70-108, 116-124; GE 1. \n9 Tr. at 37, 50, 52-59, 61-66, 70-108, 116-124; GE 1. \n10 Tr. at 37, 50, 52-59, 61-66, 70-108, 116-124; GE 1. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfamily moved back to their home in state B.

Her issues progressively worsened over the years. He earned \napproximately $80,000 to $90,000 annually when his wife\u2019s medical issues began. \nThough they have had health insurance, they incurred significant out-of-pocket costs for \nthe specialists his wife has seen over the years.12 \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a mortgage account for the home Applicant owns in state B. The \naccount is $28,320 past due with a total loan balance of $391,740. He purchased this \nhome in 2005 for $365,000, and he refinanced it several months later for $417,000. \nApplicant testified that he completed two loan modifications: the first in 2007 or 2008, \nwhen he was first delinquent on his mortgage, and the second in April 2018. During the \nsecond loan modification process, the initial mortgage holder sold the account to the \ncurrent mortgage holder and the $39,000 past-due amount was forgiven. He provided \ndocumentation, executed by both himself and his mortgage holder, to corroborate his \nclaim. His total loan balance was $360,000, for which he was paying $3,100 monthly. \nHe testified that he made a total of four to five monthly mortgage payments between \nApril 2018 and the date of the hearing. He acknowledged that he was $6,000 to $9,000 \ndelinquent on this mortgage.13 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for an $83,301 charged-off home equity line of credit (HELOC) from \nApplicant\u2019s home in state B. He obtained the HELOC in approximately 2007, to pay for \nhis family\u2019s moving expenses from state B state C. He also used $55,000 as a down \npayment for his first home in state C. He testified that he made three to four payments \ntowards the HELOC, but stopped until he completed the first loan modification for SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. He became delinquent on the HELOC in 2011. He testified that he worked with \nthe Lexington Law Firm to verify the debt; he then made several monthly payments of \n$250 towards the HELOC in accordance with a payment plan beginning in the summer \nof 2018. He provided documentation reflecting such monthly payments from June to \nNovember 2018. He acknowledged that he missed some monthly payments. He \ntestified that the total balance remaining of the HELOC was approximately $81,000.14 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are for mortgage accounts that were foreclosed in \napproximately October 2016 and October 2017, respectively, after Applicant defaulted \non both loans. SOR \u00b6 1.c is the mortgage for his second home in state C, and SOR \u00b6 \n1.d is the mortgage for his first home in state C.

He stayed in his second home in state C until \nJune 2017, when he then returned to live in his first home in state C. In October 2017, \nhis first home in state C was foreclosed. He lived in the home until December 2017. He \nindicated that he had not been contacted by either creditor about any deficiency \nbalances for his first or second homes in state C, and he was working with the \nLexington Law Firm to attempt to remove both mortgage accounts from his credit \nreport.16 \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $21,761 charged-off account. Applicant testified that he was \nunsure about this debt. He did not recall having a credit card with this creditor since \n1992, and he did not realize that the indebtedness on the card was $21,000. He testified \nthat he was working with the Lexington Law Firm to validate it. If the account is \nvalidated, he intends to work out a payment plan with the creditor to resolve this debt.17 \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $3,195 charged-off account.

He contacted a debt-resolution company, Freedom \nDebt Relief, to assist him with resolving his wife\u2019s medical expenses once he saw them \nreported on his credit report. He paid the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, \nfor which he testified that Freedom Debt Relief successfully negotiated a settlement.

Applicant testified that he has timely filed \nall of his federal and state income tax returns. He indicated that the liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o \nand 1.p are for outstanding federal and state taxes for tax year 2016, because he \nclaimed more dependents that tax year so that he could receive more money per \npaycheck to apply towards his debts. He testified that he started making payments \ntowards his outstanding federal and state taxes, but stopped when he had to pay other \ndebts, to include his wife\u2019s medical expenses. He testified that he was paying his \noutstanding federal taxes through a payment plan with the IRS in 2017, but he stopped \nwhen he was locked out of his account. He testified that he was unaware that liens were \nfiled against him until he received the amended SOR. He was going to verify the \nbalance of his outstanding liens and then attempt to negotiate a payment plan to resolve \nthem. He was also going to adjust his withholdings, as he had not yet done so as of the \ndate of the hearing.21 \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly pay as of the date of the hearing was between $6,000 \nand $9,000. He previously grossed $4,000 to $7,000 monthly from 2014 to 2017. He \nhas approximately $8,000 in his 401k retirement plan and he does not have any \nsavings. His wife has not worked outside of the home since 1996. His motorcycle was \nrepossessed in September 2018, and he drives a rental car for which he pays $185 \nweekly. He pays $3,100 monthly for his home in state B where his family lives; he also \npays $500 monthly for a rental apartment in state C where he lives. His wife manages \nthe family\u2019s finances. While he initially neglected to develop a budget, he provided \ndocumentation reflecting that he compiled one. He acknowledged that there are times \nwhen he finds himself with a monthly negative net remainder.22 \nApplicant testified that he began working with Freedom Debt Relief in \napproximately 2015 to negotiate settlements and payment plans with his creditors. He \nhad a second job that enabled him to pay Freedom Debt Relief $1,012 monthly. He \npaused his payments in the summer of 2018 when he no longer had the second job, \nand he planned to resume payments once he obtained another. He testified that he has \nbeen working with the Lexington Law Firm since approximately 2016 to validate his \ndebts, and he pays them $99 monthly. He testified that he has not received financial \ncounseling.23 \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor since November 2017 testified that he met Applicant \nin 2011, when they worked together for another employer, and he recruited Applicant for \ntheir current contract. He interacts with Applicant daily. He was aware that Applicant \nhad significant financial concerns affecting Applicant\u2019s security clearance, as Applicant \ndisclosed them to him several months prior to the hearing date.

He described their relationship as \nprimarily a professional one, but indicated that they also became personally acquainted \nwhen they worked for their prior employer. He learned in 2012 about Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nmedical issues, and testified that he would not be surprised if they amassed medical \nbills as a result. He testified that he had recently learned there were questions about \npossible financial stability affecting Applicant\u2019s security clearance, but he was unaware \nof the amount of Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness. He described Applicant\u2019s \nperformance for their prior employer as superior. He testified that he had not witnessed \nApplicant\u2019s performance for their current employer because he works in a different \ndepartment. He described Applicant\u2019s work ethic as without question, and Applicant as \na trustworthy individual. Additional character references, to include previous coworkers, \ndescribed Applicant as a reliable and trustworthy individual.25 \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n24 Tr. at 27-38; AE B, C. \n25 Tr. at 38-47; AE B. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts, to include his federal and state taxes. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying \nconditions. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He started working with Freedom Debt Relief in 2015 and the Lexington \nLaw Firm in 2016. As he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies to these five debts. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, as well as the liens in \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 1.o \nand 1.p, remain outstanding. Applicant is also delinquent on his mortgage for his home \nand the HELOC from that home in state B (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b). He provided no evidence \nthat he successfully disputed, paid, began paying, or was working out a payment plan \nfor any of his remaining delinquent debts. He has not received credit counseling. \nThough he compiled a budget, he did so after the hearing date. He acknowledged that \nthere are times when he finds himself with a monthly negative net remainder.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o \u2013 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant served in the Air Force from 1995 to 2000, and received an Honorable Discharge. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 15, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. Applicant accidentally repeated the answer to allegation 1.f on allegation 1.i. Applicant\u2019s response to allegation 1.i is included with his response to allegation 1.j. SOR allegations 1.a through 1.h concern Applicant\u2019s Federal and state tax returns and payments. On May 30, 2018, Applicant certified answers to interrogatories propounded on him by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). (Item 4.) With regard to his general tax situation Applicant stated, \u201cWife usually handles all tax paperwork, some of the items have been overlooked.\u201d (Item 4 at 9.) 1.a.

(Item 3.) On September 21, 2018, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n(Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant signed his Answer to the SOR (Answer) on November 1, 2018, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant accidentally \nrepeated the answer to allegation 1.f on allegation 1.i. Applicant\u2019s response to allegation \n1.i is included with his response to allegation 1.j. \n \n \nSOR allegations 1.a through 1.h concern Applicant\u2019s Federal and state tax returns \nand payments.

Based on all available information, I find that Applicant has disputed \nthis debt, and it is not yet resolved. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to file a Federal income tax return, as required, for 2014. He also \nfailed to file, as required, state tax returns for six years. Many other Federal and state tax \nreturns were filed late. He has a substantial Federal tax debt that is not yet resolved. In \naddition, there are past-due consumer debts. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including unpaid \ntaxes, failure to timely file tax returns, and unpaid bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid Federal back taxes are still due and owing. Applicant did not \nsupply documentation to show that he has filed all of his past-due Federal and state tax \nreturns. Nor did he submit any evidence to show that he has entered into a current \npayment arrangement with the IRS or any state taxing authority, and is in compliance with \nsuch arrangements if he had filed tax returns and owed taxes. There is no evidence that \nthe debt in allegation 1.k has been resolved. Applicant did not supply any information to \nsupport a finding that his financial problems were beyond his control, or that he had acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), (d), and (g) do not apply.  \n \nApplicant submitted disputes to the credit reporting services concerning \nallegations 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l. The disputes had not been resolved as of the date the record \nclosed. AG 20(e) applies to those debts, and the allegations are found for Applicant. With \nthose exceptions, Applicant did not mitigate his tax and other financial issues. Guideline \nF is found against Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that the back taxes and other debts were being resolved, or \nthat he had filed all of his tax returns. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress \nremains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted. \nHistory of Case\nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DoD\nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security\nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/27/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 17, 2018, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 5, 2018, and was scheduled for hearing on July 26,\n2018. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two \nexhibits, which were admitted without objection; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand seven exhibits, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 3,  2018.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of\ndetailed facts taken from five U.S. Government official publications. Administrative or\nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007);  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). \nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the\nabove-named background reports containing the identified facts in Department\nCounsel\u2019s Request for Administration Notice regarding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n(Saudi Arabia) that addresses the geopolitical situation in Saudi Arabia.  Administrative\nNotice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with the provisions of\nRule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. \nExcept for the specific facts referenced by Department Counsel in her\nadministrative notice, request, Applicant was not foreclosed from challenging the\naccuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports addressing Saudi\nArabia\u2019s  current status. Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice Request was\nreceived as HE 1.\nProcedural Rulings \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of Applicant\u2019s\nsponsor\u2019s continued sponsorship of Applicant for a security clearance. For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department Counsel\nwas afforded three days to respond.  \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a letter from his\nsponsor confirming its continued sponsorship of Applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was admitted without objection as AE H.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guidelines B and L (by incorporation), Applicant allegedly provided\nexecutive security service from 2005 to present to an important high ranking Saudi\nofficial, who is a citizen and resident of Saudi Arabia, and who previously served as an\n2\n\nimportant high ranking official of Saudi Arabia and formerly a senior military officer in the\nSaudi Army. Under Guideline L, Applicant allegedly worked for A Company Ltd, a\ncompany from approximately 2005 to present, which could result in a conflict with your\ncurrent employment.  \nIn his  response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations with explanations. He\nclaimed he no longer provides any services for the company identified in SOR \u00b6 2.a. or\nhave any contract with the same company or any high-ranking Saudi officials. He further\nclaimed that all information has been deleted in accordance with his deed of disclaimer.\nApplicant claimed that both his father, himself, and his only son are proud Marines.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old armed security officer (currently sponsored by a defense\ncontractor) who seeks a security clearance.

(Tr.\n68, 71-72)  \nWorking for Saudi official X was C\u2019s main source of income before starting his own\ncompany in 2012. (Tr. 68-69) While employed by A Company Ltd., Applicant earned\n$100,000 annually during his years of service. (Tr. 46) When working with X in the 2009-\n2013 time frame, Applicant performed various security duties for X\u2019s wife and five children\nwho were in boarding schools in the United States. (GE 2 and A-B; Tr. 67)\nBetween 2012 and 2018, Applicant worked for Company B as a security\nconsultant. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 70-72) Company B continues to sponsor Applicant despite the\n3\n\nfact that it doesn\u2019t presently have a need for his services. (AE H) Applicant remains on\nretainer with Company B pending (a) his obtaining a security clearance and (b) the\ncompany acquires DoD contracts that will create needs for Applicant\u2019s services. (Tr. 70-\n74-75, 78-81) In the meantime, Applicant continues to provide security consulting\nservices for another company that does not require a security clearance. (Tr. 81-82) \nApplicant\u2019s contract with A Company Ltd. was terminated with an effective\ntermination date of October 2017. (AE A) Supporting documents in his termination\npackage include a confidentiality deed of general release and a deed of disclaimer. (AE\nA) Severance payments were set at $50,000, in addition to payments of fees accrued\nbetween July 2017 and October 2017. (AE A) Since his separation from A Company Ltd,\nApplicant has had no further dealings with this firm or X. (Tr. 76)\nWhen working with Saudi official B, Applicant performed various security duties for\nX\u2019s wife and five children.  (GE 2 and AEs A-B; Tr. 64-65) Applicant\u2019s principal duties to X\ninvolved executive protection and entailed extensive travel outside the United States\n(mostly to and from Saudi Arabia).  \nCountry status of Saudi Arabia\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King Bin Abdulagiza al Saud\nwho is both the head of state and head of government. Albeit, since June 2017,\nsupervision of the affairs of the Saudi government have been delegated to Y. (AEs C-G\nand I) \nThe Saudi government bases its legitimacy on its interpretations of Sharia (Islamic\nlaw) and the 1992 Basic Law which specifies that the rules of the country shall be made\nby descendants of King Abdulaziz al Saul. See Administrative Notice at 2; Saudi Arabia\nHuman Rights Report, U.S. Dept.  of State (April 2018).\nSince Saudi official Y\u2019s elevation in June 2017 (placing him in line to succeed his\nfather), he has gone to great lengths to assert his rule as the sharer of the Kingdom\u2019s\nnational security and economic policies. The effect has been to consolidate authority\nunder one individual and sub-branch of the family-a move unprecedented in the Kingdom\nsince its founding under th late Ibn Saud. (AEs B-G and I)  Under the leadership of Saudi\nofficial Y, Saudi Arabia has activated a more assertive posture, typified by the Kingdom\u2019s\nmilitary operations in neighboring Yemen and its insistence on the departure of President\nBashar al Assad in Syria. (AEs B\u2013G and I)\nThe Obama Administration, like its predecessors, engaged the Saudi government\nas a strategic partner to promote regional security and global economic stability. (AEs B-\nG and I) Building on discord that emerged between the Obama Administration and Saudi\nleaders over differences of opinion over Iran, Syria, and Yemen, Saudi leaders, among\nother issues, President Trump and King Salman forged a new strategic partnership in\nJanuary 2017 for the 21  century in the interest of both countries by formally announcing\nst\na Joint strategic Vision. (AEs B-G and I) \n4\n\nSince 2011, significant changes in political and economic conditions in the Middle\nEast have shifted international attention on Saudi domestic policy issues and\nstrengthened social and political debates among Saudi Arabia and its historical allies.\n(AEs B-G and I) Issues include political reform, unemployment, education, human rights,\ncorruption, religious freedom, and extremism.\nTravel warnings and terrorist threats\nDue to the increased exposure to terrorism for Americans visiting Saudi Arabia, the\nState Department has issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory regarding Saudi Arabia, advising\nU.S. travelers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d while visiting Saudi Arabia due to terrorism\nand the threat of missile attacks on civilian targets. See Administrative Notice, supra,\nciting Saudi Arabia Travel Advisory, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2018)\nRebel groups operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia,\ntargeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure. Missile attacks emanating from these\ngroups have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah. See Administrative Notice,\nsupra and  Saudi Arabia Travel Advisory, supra.  Violence in Yemen has spilled over into\nSaudi Arabia on a number of occasions. See id.\nBoth ISIS and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) contrive to encourage\nindividual acts of terrorism within the Kingdom. ISIS attacks against Saudi security forces,\nShia mosques, community center, and western targets in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) states in 2016 demonstrate the seriousness of the posed \nthreats to Saudi Arabia and the region by ISIS. Administrative Notice, supra, at 3; Country\nReports on Terrorism 2016, at 219, U.S. Dept. Of State (July 2017): \nReligious freedom and human rights issues\nBecause the Saudi legal system is based on Sharia, freedom of religious enjoys no\nprotected status in the Kingdom. See Administrative Notice, supra; Saudi Arabia 2017,\nInt\u2019l Religious Freedom Report, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2017). The 1992 Basic Law\ncriminalizes the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form and other acts considered\ncontrary to Sharia, including non-Islamic public worship, public display of non-Islamic\nreligious symbols, conversion by a Muslim to another religion, and proselytizing by a non-\nMuslim. See id. \nHuman rights abuses also continue to plague Saudi Arabian governance.\nExamples include unlawful killings (including execution for other than the most serious\noffenses) without due process, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, political prisoners,\narbitrary interference with privacy, restrictions on freedom of expression, restrictions on\npeaceful assembly, association, movement, and religion. See Administrative Notice,\nsupra, at 4, citing Saudi Arabia 2017 Human Rights Report at 1, U.S. Dept. Of State (April\n2018). Other Saudi restrictions include the lack of ability and legal means to choose their\ngovernment through free and fair elections, trafficking in persons, violence and official\n5\n\ngender discrimination against women (mitigated in part by newly announced women\u2019s\nrights initiatives), and criminalization of same sex sexual activity. See id.\nOther stress points in U.S.-Saudi relations \nFollowing U.S. Senate review of the reported brutal murder of U.S.-residing\njournalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit team in 2018, the U.S. Senate in December\n2018 passed a resolution condemning Saudi official Y for his believed orchestrated\nmurder of the journalist See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi Official A for\nKhashoggi Murder. https://www.cnn.com  (Dec. 13, 2018). The manifest intent of the\nresolution was to ratchet pressure on President Trump who reportedly appeared to align\nhimself with the Saudi Kingdom for economic reasons and a perceived desire to withhold\nsanctions on the Kingdom for strategic political reasons.\nJust prior to passing its resolution by voice vote, the U.S. Senate also unanimously\napproved a resolution by a 56-41 vote that requires the United States to end its military\nsupport of the Saudi-led war in Yemen. See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi\nOfficial A for Khashoggi Murder https://www.cnn.com, supra  (Dec. 13, 2018) While both of\nthe Senate-passed resolutions amounted to significant breaks within Congress with the\nU..S. administration toward Saudi Arabia, neither resolution was followed by comparable\naction in the House, and, as a result, never reached the President for consideration. The\nPresident, though, has to date steered clear of blaming Y, and considers Saudi Arabia to\nbe a very good ally. See id.\nThe Senate vote on the Yemen resolution manifestly reflected frustration with the\nrepeated human casualties from the War in Yemen and the Administration\u2019s embrace of\nSaudi official A, despite widely accepted evidence from U.S. intelligence agencies that A \nordered the killing  of Khashoggi. See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi Official A\nfor Khashoggi Murder https://www.com (Dec. 13, 2018), supra. To what extent President\nTrump will go in endorsing and implementing the Senate\u2019s passed resolutions is unclear at\nthis point.            \nPotential Applicant conflicts of interest   \nPotential conflicts of interest arise as the result of Applicant\u2019s acceptance of the\ndisclaimer agreement he signed with A Company Ltd. following his separation from the\nfirm July 2018. (AE H) Under the terms of the agreement with his former employer,\nApplicant is obligated to retain and withhold any information he acquired during their 12-\nyear employment relationship. (AE A) Information terms include trade secrets, technology\nor commercial information of the company and/or Saudii official X and/or any other\nmember of Saudi official X\u2019s family (inclusive of Saudi official Y) and/or any other\ncompany, entity or organization directly or indirectly associated with Y and his family,\nwhich he may have received or obtained while in the service of the company. (AE A) \nBy the termination agreement\u2019s terms, the specified disclosure restrictions shall\ncontinue to apply to Applicant following the termination of his consulting agreement without\n6\n\nlimit in point of time, save for information which may come into the public domain\notherwise than through unauthorized disclosure. (AE A)  Whether the non-disclosure\nprovisions were intended to apply to persons with conflicting responsibilities imposed by\ntheir government-issued security clearances, or can be preempted in a proper case is\nunclear.\nWhile these disclosure restrictions may be typical of termination agreements\nreached in standard commercial relationships, they create potential irreconcilable conflicts\nwhen they involve high-level officials of a country (Saudi Arabia in this case) with far-\nreaching connections with the United States. In this context, potential conflicts can be\nenvisioned where Applicant is placed in a position where he has to make a choice\nbetween honoring the anti-disclosure terms of his termination agreement and protecting\nthe security interests of the United States. Under these special circumstances, potential\nirreconcilable conflicts of interest between Applicant and his former employer (A Company\nLtd) and U.S. security interests cannot be ruled out.      \n          \n                       \nPolicies\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by administrative\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the\n\"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should\nbe granted, continued or denied.  \nThe Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to assess these factors\nexclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\nadministrative judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of\nthe Directive, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern. Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited\nto, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern\nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security\nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of\nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the\n7\n\nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited, considerations\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  See \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 6.\n \n                        Outside activities\nThe Concern. Involvement in certain types of outside employment or\nactivities is of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an\nindividual\u2019s security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified or sensitive information (AG) \u00b6 33.\n                                    Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue  \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a  threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, factual findings\ncannot be drawn from inferences grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must\ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth and an honorably discharged Marine who\nretained business interests for many years with a firm whose principal client was X. \nSecurity issues of concern to the Government focus on potential conflicts of interest\nbetween Applicant and the disclosure restrictions imposed on him in his exit agreement\nwith Company A Ltd. and the potential conflicts of interest with the United States with his\nacquiring a security clearance.\n8\n\nJurisdictional issues\nApplicant\u2019s employment relationship with his current sponsor (Company B) is a bit \nambiguous when it comes to establishing a prospective start-up date for Applicant. While\nApplicant\u2019s employer of over six years continues to list its sponsorship of Applicant for a\nsecurity clearance in the Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and reaffirmed its\nintention to employ Applicant in the future once he obtains a security clearance, Company\nB does not currently include Applicant on its payroll and has not provided Applicant with\nany assurances as to when he can be expected to be hired once he obtains a clearance.\nTo meet his expense needs, Applicant has had to secure other sources of employment\nthat do not require a security clearance.  \nProcedures established by DoD Directive 5220.6 mandate that actions initiated\nunder the Directive shall cease \u201cupon termination of the applicant\u2019s need for access to\nclassified information, except in those cases in which one of the following occurs: a\nhearing has commenced (\u00b6 4.4.2); a clearance decision has been issued; (\u00b6 4.4.3), or the\napplicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended and the applicant provided a written request\nthat the case continue (\u00b6 4.4.1).\u201d See Directive 5220.6, \u00b6\u00b6 4.4 et seq. Because the hearing\nin Applicant\u2019s case had commenced (\u00b6 4.4.2) before his current need for a clearance could\nbe fully explored, the case was able to proceed on the merits. Whether Company B will\never obtain the DoD contract it will need to utilize Applicant\u2019s services is unclear at this\npoint. While this leaves Applicant\u2019s current need to know in uncertain status, jurisdiction is\nretained.\nForeign influence concerns\nGovernment urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s listed employment\nrelationship with A Company Ltd could potentially compromise his responsibilities with the\nUnited States as clearance holder with access to classified information. While Applicant\nhas since terminated his service arrangements with A Company Ltd. The disclosure\nrestrictions he agreed to in 2017 could potentially place him at risk of having to make an\nelection as to whether to honor his anti-disclosure obligations even if it could impact the\nU.S. security interests he has sworn to protect, or breach his agreement\u2019s anti-disclosure\nprovisions to provide needed intelligence information to DoD agencies. This potentially\nexposes Applicant to a potential Hobson\u2019s choice that could place him at heightened risk\nof making an election that could potentially harm U.S. security interests. \nBecause Applicant is potentially exposed to being placed in a conflict of interest\nsituation due to his past business relationships with A Company Ltd and high-ranking\nSaudi official B in particular, two disqualifying conditions apply. Both DC 7(a), \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d and DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\n9\n\nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d apply to\nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nThe potential for conflicts of interest for an applicant with contractual obligations to\na company or persons whose citizenship or resident status in a country who presents a\nheightened risk to U.S. security interests poses potential security risks. Saudi Arabia has a\nlong and valued history as a strategic partner of the United States in commerce and\nforeign affairs. The country also creates ongoing security concerns over its human rights\nrecord, its toleration for terrorist groups operating within its borders, and its embrace of\nSharia and other state practices that offend U.S. moral foundations and legal traditions.  \nThese risks identifiable above are manageable, though, and are reconcilable with\nU.S. security interests for several reasons. Longstanding political and commercial relations\nbetween the United States and Saudi Arabia, shared security interests in the Middle East\nbetween the United States and Saudi Arabia, and Applicant\u2019s demonstrated strong\nloyalties to the United States and manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security\ninterests under any and all circumstances make unlikely any Saudi efforts to pressure or\ncoerce Applicant into disclosing classified or sensitive information in his possession.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with conflicting interests in foreign\ncountries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied\nmaterials and country information about Saudi Arabia. \nThe AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United\nStates as an important consideration in gauging whether a potential conflict of interest in a\nparticular case is outweighed by the applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalties and commitments\nto protecting U.S. security interests at all costs. Still, the geopolitical aims and policies of\nthe particular foreign regime involved do matter. \n In Applicant\u2019s case, his demonstrated loyalties and commitment to protecting U.S.\nsecurity interests enable him to take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC\n\u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d In the hypothetical situation where Applicant\u2019 is presented with an\nactual choice of which set of obligations he should adhere (i.e., his anti-disclosure duties to\nA Company Ltd of U.S. security interests), Applicant\u2019s demonstrated strong loyalties,\npatriotism, and security commitments to the United States make it very unlikely that he\nwould permit himself to be pressured into compromising classified information. \n10\n\nOf full benefit to Applicant, too, is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the United States are well demonstrated and\nenough under these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his\npast relationships with A Company Ltd and high-ranking Saudi official X.\nOutside activities concerns\nPotential conflicts of interest that are presented by Applicant\u2019s past consulting\nagreement with A Company Ltd. and work for X are raised under Guideline L for\nessentially the same reasons that are covered by the Government\u2019s raised foreign\ninfluence concerns. One  disqualifying condition applies to Applicant\u2019s situation here: DC\n\u00b6\u00b6 37(a), \u201cany employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: (1) the\ngovernment of a foreign country: (2) and foreign national, organization, or other entity; (3)\na representative of any foreign interest; an (4) any foreign, domestic, or international\norganization or person engaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on\nintelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology.\nFor the same reasons covered in the analysis of Applicant\u2019s potential conflict of\ninterests as the result of his long working relationships with A Company Ltd. and X,\nApplicant\u2019s actions can be favorably reconciled with his proven strong and lasting \ndevotion to the security interests of the United States. MC \u00b6 38(b), \u201cthe individual\nterminated the employment or discontinued the activity upon being notified that it was in\nconflict with his or her security responsibilities,\u201d has some application to the facts in\nApplicant\u2019s case. Full application of this mitigating condition cannot be applied only\nbecause Applicant ended his consulting relationship with A Company Ltd. in 2017\nvoluntarily without any prior notice of any potential conflict with the security responsibilities\nhe could be expected to assume with a security clearance.\nWhole-person assessment\nWhole-person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\npotential conflicts of interests with his A Company Ltd and HRS consulting connections.\nNot only is Applicant a loyal and dedicated U.S. patriot with strong Marine Corps values\ninstilled in him, but he has made every effort to defend U.S. security interests in the past\nwhere potential conflicts could arise. Applicant is well regarded and trusted by his sponsor\nwho continues to look for DoD contracts where it can utilize Applicant\u2019s professional\nservices. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on him as the result of his past consulting arrangements with A Company Ltd and\nHRH would appear to be minimal. By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, \n11\n\nApplicant has no visible conflicts of interest with A Company Ltd and X that could be at\nrealistic risk to exploitation or compromise. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's past business\nrelationships in Saudi Arabia are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments\nabout his ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his prior business\nrelationships in Saudi Arabia. His demonstrated loyalties and commitments to protecting\nU.S. security interests make it highly unlikely he would succumb to any foreign influence\nbrought to bear on himself by A Company Ltd., high ranking Saudi official X,  or any Saudi\nofficials.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $22,158.40 for six delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). SOR 1.a addressed a $3,409 delinquent federal income tax debt for the 2015 tax year, and SOR 1.f addressed a $1,872 debt for unpaid state personal property taxes in the 2015 tax year. The remaining allegations addressed a total of $16,876 for four delinquent or past-due personal credit accounts. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but SOR 1.e, claiming without any documentary support that he had paid that debt. (FORM, Item 1) Under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant intentionally made a false official statement when he omitted from a July 2009 e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e (SOR 2.a). The record compiled in support of the SOR did not support that allegation. As provided for by section E3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel amended the SOR by withdrawing SOR 2.a.

After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information.1 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n01/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nOn June 8, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct).2 Applicant timely responded to the SOR \n(Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing.  \n \nOn August 10, 2018, Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM)3 in support of the SOR. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 14, 2018, and he was informed he had 30 days \nfrom the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM and \nto submit additional information in response to the FORM.4 The record closed on \nSeptember 28, 2018, after Applicant did not respond to the FORM or object to the \nconsideration of any of the Government\u2019s exhibits. I received this case for decision on \nDecember 21, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $22,158.40 for \nsix delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). SOR 1.a addressed a $3,409 delinquent \nfederal income tax debt for the 2015 tax year, and SOR 1.f addressed a $1,872 debt for \nunpaid state personal property taxes in the 2015 tax year. The remaining allegations \naddressed a total of $16,876 for four delinquent or past-due personal credit accounts. In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but SOR 1.e, claiming without any \ndocumentary support that he had paid that debt. (FORM, Item 1) \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant intentionally made a \nfalse official statement when he omitted from a July 2009 e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR \n1.a \u2013 1.e (SOR 2.a). The record compiled in support of the SOR did not support that \nallegation. As provided for by section E3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel \namended the SOR by withdrawing SOR 2.a. (FORM, Section III at 2) Accordingly, only \nthe issues raised under Guideline F were before me for decision. \n \n \nAll of the SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR \n(FORM, Item 1) and in statements he made during two personal subject interviews (PSI) \non July 19 and August 15, 2017. Additionally, the information presented in two credit \nreports (FORM, Items 4 and 5) and documents from the IRS (FORM, Item 6) and the tax \nauthority in the state where Applicant lives (FORM, Item 7) support the SOR allegations \nunder Guideline F. In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since March 2010. Applicant\u2019s federal income tax debt arose from early \n                                                 \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 2. \n3 See Directive, Section E3.1.7. In the FORM, Department Counsel relies on seven enclosed exhibits (Items \n1 \u2013 7). \n4 See Directive, Section E3.1.7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwithdrawal penalties from his 401k account to make a down payment on his home. The \nfunds he withdrew became taxable income that Applicant failed to declare on his 2015 \nincome tax returns. (FORM, Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state property tax debt is actually due for the 2016 tax year, not for \n2015 as alleged in SOR 1.f. Applicant incurred this debt for not paying the taxes \nassociated with his mortgage. His taxes and insurance were not bundled with the \nmortgage and interest payments each month. The record does not contain any \nexplanation of why Applicant did not pay his property taxes in 2016. (FORM, Ite 3) \n \n \nDuring his PSIs, Applicant stated his intention to use his 2017 income tax refund, \nalong with a home equity loan, to resolve all of his outstanding debts. Applicant did not \nsubmit, either with his response to the SOR or by responding to the FORM, any \ninformation that shows he has acted to resolve any of his debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the \nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. Department Counsel must produce sufficient reliable \ninformation on which DOD based its preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security \nclearance for an applicant. Additionally, Department Counsel must prove controverted \n                                                 \n5 See Directive, 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n4 \n \nfacts alleged in the SOR.7 If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the case for disqualification.8 \n \n  \nBecause no one is entitled to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden \nof persuasion to establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for them to \nhave access to protected information. A person who has access to such information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. \nThus, there is a compelling need to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the nation\u2019s interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation in favor of the Government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThis record reasonably raises the security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, this record requires application of the disqualifying conditions at \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \n \nBy contrast, none of the information presented in this record supports application \nof any of the pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions. The record shows Applicant\u2019s debts \nare current, insofar as they are still unresolved; that he has not made any payments to \nthose debts; that he has not sought any professional financial assistance or counseling \n                                                 \n7 See Directive, E3.1.14. \n8 See Directive, E3.1.15. \n9 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nto improve his finances; and that he has not paid his tax debts. The security concerns \nraised by the adverse information about Applicant\u2019s finances are not mitigated. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the available \ninformation leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that were raised by his financial problems. Because protection of \nthe national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against the individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 30, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-\nQIP). On March 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on October 22, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 27, 2018. The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered no exhibits.  Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 7, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old, and is married with five children.  He has a high school \ndiploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer Technician Level IV.  \nHe is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nApplicant began working for his current employer in November 2005.  \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in criminal activity that \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse.  On three occasions over the past \ntwenty years, he has been arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  \nTwo of the arrests involved car accidents caused by the Applicant as a result of his \nimpairment.  During his personal subject interview on November 9, 2017, Applicant told \nthe investigator that he continues to consume alcohol and then operates motor vehicles \nwhile impaired. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he began consuming alcohol at the young age of 14.  When \nhe started, he was drinking maybe four or five beers on the weekend.  (Tr.  p. 18.)  By \nage 18, through his mid-20\u2019s, he was consuming alcohol once or twice a week, and \neach time he drank to the point of intoxication.       \n \n \nIn September 1997, Applicant was first arrested and charged with DUI.  Applicant \nwas arrested after he struck a parked vehicle.  His blood alcohol level was .18.  \nApplicant states that he was leaving a gathering with some friends and had consumed \nabout 16 beers over a period of 6 hours.  He smashed the front passenger side of his \nvehicle.  After he was arrested, he was taken to jail.  His license was suspended and he \nwas fined approximately $700.  He was also required to complete a driver\u2019s education \nclass.  (Tr. p. 21.)   Applicant states that following this DUI, he stopped drinking for \nabout a month.  He then returned to his regular drinking pattern. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn January 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  This time he \nrear ended another vehicle at a stop light.  At the time of his arrest, Applicant blood \nalcohol level was .2.  Applicant explained that he was coming from a co-workers house \nwhere he had consumed about 20 beers over a period of six hours.  Applicant was \nfound guilty of the charge.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year, he was fined \n$1,300 that he completed with community service, he was required to attend 20 \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings, and also a driver\u2019s education class.  Applicant states \nthat he completed all of the courts requirements.  (Tr. p. 24.)  Following this arrest, \nApplicant stopped drinking for about two months.  (Tr. p. 25.) \n \n \nIn November 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI a third time.  \nApplicant was pulled over for speeding and the police smelled alcohol on his breath.  \nApplicant was tested for DUI and had a blood alcohol level of .09.  He was coming from \na friend\u2019s house where he had consumed between six and eight beers.  Applicant states \nthat because the police officer moved and could not testify in court the matter was \ndismissed on a technicality.  (Tr. p. 27.)  He admits that he was intoxicated at the time of \nthe arrest.  When Applicant was asked by the Department Counsel, why drink and still \nget behind the wheel?  Applicant responded that, \u201cJust \u2013 I just feel sometimes I gotta  -- \nI gotta go.  And I just - - and I just go.\u201d  (Tr. p. 27.)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that the last time he drank and got behind the wheel to drive \nwas within the last six months before the hearing.  (Tr. p. 29.)  Applicant states that he \ndoes not plan on ruling out his drinking in the future, but because there are other \noptions available such has Lyft service he plans to use that more to keep himself from \ndrinking and driving.  (Tr. p. 30.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;  \n \n \nApplicant has been arrested and charged on three separate occasions with DUI, \nand continues to drink and drive.  This evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifications. \n \nThe conditions set forth under AG \u00b6 32 could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not  cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse involving three arrests for DUI, and the fact \nthat he continues to drink and drive, the last time occurring just six months before the \nhearing, indicates that he does not show the required good judgment and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.  Although \nhis DUI\u2019s occurred more than nine years ago, Applicant has continued to drink and drive \nand has simply been lucky not to have been arrested.  He has not produced sufficient \nevidence to establish that future criminal problems are unlikely. He has not established \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 32.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant incurred three arrests and charges for DUI.  \nThese incidents raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).   \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Although it has \nnot been determined if he is an alcoholic or is alcohol dependent, he has had three \nalcohol-related incidents, two involving serious car accidents that he caused.  He \ncontinues to consumed alcohol to excess.  His conduct has been irresponsible and \ndangerous.  Following each DUI arrest, he has tried to stop drinking.  On each \noccasion, after a short period, he resumed his previous pattern of drinking.  Given the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nextensive nature of his drinking problem, and the fact that he continues to drink and \ndrive, Applicant has not shown the requisite good judgment and reliability necessary to \naccess classified information.   \u00b6 32 does not provide mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant continues to consume \nalcohol to excess even after being arrested on three occasions for DUI.  At this time, \nthere is no strong evidence in the record to show that he will remain sober for any \nsustained period.  He has failed to present sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to \novercome his heavy burden to mitigate his alcohol abuse.  Overall, the record evidence \nraises doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from the \ncited adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:    \n           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:                       Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He is a 50-year-old senior administrative associate employed\nby a U.S. defense contractor since January 2007. He has been employed in related\npositions with two other defense contractors since October 1993. He has previously had\nfavorable background investigations in September 1998 and April 2006. This appears to\nbe a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (Item 1).\nApplicant disclosed his IRS tax debt for tax years 2006-2007 and 2009-2013 on\nhis January 2016 clearance application (Item 3), and discussed them at length during\nhis June 2017 interview with a Government investigator (Item 4). He stated that he\nreceived a notice(s) in January 2016 about the delinquent tax years, made one\ntelephone call to the IRS that went unanswered, and thereafter made no effort to\ncontact the IRS to arrange a payment schedule. He attributed his tax debt to his not\nadjusting his income tax withholding to reflect his income. However, he offered no\nexplanation for his failure to file his Federal tax returns on time. Applicant\u2019s IRS tax\ntranscripts for the years in question show that the IRS filed tax liens against Applicant in\nJuly 2017. Applicant\u2019s Answer admits the tax debt and states only, without\ncorroboration, that he was working with the IRS and his bank to pay the debt off.\nApplicant denied failing to timely file his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, and 2016-2017\nstate and Federal income tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.r). He admits owing the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) over $58,000 (SOR 1.s-1.aa, exclusive of 1.w\u2014not used).\nApplicant denied failing to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for nine\nyears. However, Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts for 2005-2016 (Item 4) show that\nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2005-2006, 2010-2013,\nand 2016.  Record evidence does not confirm that Applicant failed to file his 2017\n3\nFederal income tax return (SOR 1.i) or his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, 2016-2017 state\nincome tax returns (SOR 1.j-1.r). Accordingly, I find those allegations for Applicant.\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community\ninvolvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nIn fairness to Applicant, he filed for extensions for several years, and missed the extended filing deadlines\n3\nby only days or weeks\u2014compared to some years where he missed the filing deadlines by months or years.\nNevertheless, Applicant was assessed late filing fees and late payment fees.\n2\n\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his\nFederal income tax returns for eight of twelve years between 2005 and 2016. The IRS\nnotified Applicant that he had delinquent taxes in January 2016, but Applicant took no\nmeaningful action to address his taxes. The IRS filed tax liens for these tax years in July\n2017. Furthermore, Applicant documented no efforts to contact the IRS since his June\n2017 interview5\nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information.\nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good\njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access\nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously\nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their\nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required;\n3\n\nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and\nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d6\nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful  or attributed to the press of other\n7\ncircumstances.  As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of\n8\nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal\nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal\nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many\nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling\nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that\ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A\nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good\njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to\nclassified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant\nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183\n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the\nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly\nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that\ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive\npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct\nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a\nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd.\nDec. 9, 2015).\nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an\nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case\nhis failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant\ntax debt that he has not addressed.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His\nfailures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are\nnot demonstrated to be likely to recur.  Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his\n9\nISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable decision.\n6\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years).\nSee, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester).\n7\nSee, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file).\n8\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n9\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n4\n\nfailures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay\narrangements were due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has\nnot been responsible in addressing his taxes.10\n \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and there are no clear\nindications that his tax debt is being resolved.  He has documented no contacts with\n11\nthe IRS, and consequently cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to\nresolve his taxes.   Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might\n12\nsupport a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his\nconduct.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 15, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the \ncase file. In a sworn statement, dated September 5, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 3, 2018, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on December 20, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on January 19, 2019. \nApplicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of February 27, 2019, he \nhad not done so. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.s.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a technician with his current employer (or subcontractor) since November 2016. A \n2005 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2012, and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been \ngranted a security clearance. Applicant was married in 2012. He has no children. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nDuring his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2017, Applicant initially denied \nhaving any judgments filed against him or having any accounts sent to collections. Upon \nbeing confronted with certain contrary facts, he either acknowledged the status of certain \naccounts, disputed the status of some accounts, overlooked some accounts, or claimed \nhe did recall anything about other accounts. He subsequently attributed his financial \nissues to \u201cbouts of unemployment and low paying jobs, where [he] was unable to cover \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated June 15, 2017); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nSeptember 19, 2017); Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 22, \n2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 31, 2018).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nall of his debt.\u201d2 But, he noted that in April 2017, he received a wage increase and that \nincrease would enable him to start paying off his delinquent debts.3 In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because he was forced to use credit \ncards and sustained his debt. \u201cUnfortunately this debt became too much and [he] was \nunable to pay any of it off.\u201d4 In his e-QIP, Applicant noted only one period of \nunemployment (November 2011 until September 2012) after he was let go by mutual \nagreement (actually fired) following notice of unsatisfactory performance. During that \nperiod, he was a student supported by his wife and unemployment compensation. \nAlthough he was not unemployed for any reported period thereafter, another employer \nreleased him for unsatisfactory performance because Applicant routinely failed to follow \nthe company\u2019s shift schedule and was repeatedly disciplined and counseled.5  \nThe SOR identified 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or filed as judgments, all generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s June 2017 or \nJanuary 2018 credit reports. Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to \nresolve the accounts, but stated that he planned to do so once the accounts with lower \nbalances are paid off.6 Those debts, totaling approximately $93,582, all of which were \nplaced for collection, are described below: \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) an unspecified type of account for $1,355 that was sold to a debt \npurchaser before becoming a judgment; (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) an unspecified type of account for \n$6,555 that was sold to a debt purchaser before being reduced to a judgment; (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c.) an unsecured guaranteed loan for $3,067 that was charged off; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through \n1.p.) education loans that fell into default and were returned to the U.S. Department of \nEducation in the amounts of $5,116; $4,032; $6,121; $3,965; $6,121; $376; $4,497; \n$3,164; $6,619; $4,266; $6,913; $8,924; and $9,278; (SOR \u00b6 1.q.) an unspecified type of \naccount for $11,621 that was charged off; (SOR \u00b6 1.r.) an unspecified type of account for \n$1,521 that went to judgment; and (SOR \u00b6 1.s.) an unspecified type of account for $71. \nApplicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt \npayments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. There is no evidence that since his April 2017 pay increase he has made any \n                                                          \n2 Item 5, supra note 1, at 11. \n \n3 Item 5, supra note 1, at 6-11. \n \n4 Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated September 5, 2018). \n \n5 Item 5, supra note 1, at 5. \n6 Item 5, supra note 1. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay \noff delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.

While not alleged in the SOR, it is noted that \nApplicant also had an account with a jewelry company with a high credit of $4,500 that \nwent to judgment, but was eventually paid off in 2016.7 Other than his general statements \nabout his future intentions, Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial \nsituation has improved, or that it is now under control.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d8 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d9   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n7 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndelinquent accounts, as well as his lack of candor on his e-QIP, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above.  \n \n8 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n9 Exec.

Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.11  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d12  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d13 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nThe SOR identified 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or filed as judgments, totaling $93,582. Those delinquent accounts all \ncontinue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully employed since \nNovember 2016 (and receiving a salary increase in April 2017). Applicant claimed that \nwhen he was unemployed in 2011-2012, he was unable to make his required monthly \npayments, but it appears that he was simply content to remain unemployed for a period \nof time sufficient for him to continue his education (by increasing the unpaid balance of \nhis student loans), and drawing unemployment benefits. Applicant\u2019s failure to even \naddress the one delinquent debt in the amount of $71 constitutes an unwillingness to \nsatisfy his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;14 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;15  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \n                                                          \n14 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n15 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his one period of \nunemployment (November 2011 until September 2012), and insufficient funds to maintain \nhis financial responsibilities. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant made any \nefforts, much less \u201cgood-faith\u201d efforts, before or after he was interviewed by OPM; before \nor after the SOR was issued in August 2018; or even after he was sent the FORM in \nDecember 2018, to: obtain financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, \nsuch as a non-profit credit counseling service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the \ncredit reporting agencies or the creditors themselves; contact his creditors to set up \nrepayment plans; or indicate that payments had been made to his creditors.16  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.17 In this instance, to date, there is no evidence that any \ncorrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s finances are under control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n16 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n17 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.18  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 32-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor, serving as a technician with his current employer \nor a subcontractor since November 2016. He had a non-SOR account with a jewelry \ncompany with a high credit of $4,500 that went to judgment, but was eventually paid off \nin 2016. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant exhibited a lack of candor when he completed his e-QIP and denied having any \nfinancial issues. He actually had 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection, charged off, or reduced to judgment totaling $93,582. Those delinquent \naccounts all continue to be unaddressed and unresolved by Applicant, despite his being \nfully employed since November 2016, and receiving a salary increase in April 2017. \nApplicant has made no efforts to resolve his delinquent debts despite promising to do so. \nApplicant has not obtained financial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, and \nhe offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is \nnow under control. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:19 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \n                                                          \n18 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor, if not non-existent, track record of \ndebt reduction and elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding all of the debts in his name. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.s.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Common access card \n(CAC) credentialing eligibility is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 17, 2017, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF 85). On July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing eligibility concerns for CAC \ncredentialing pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive \u2013 12, Policy for a \nCommon Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, August 27, \n2004 (HSPD-12). DOD was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant CAC eligibility.  \n \nThis action is based on the Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS) found in \nDOD Instruction (DODI) 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative Guidance for \nIssuing the Common Access Card, dated September 9, 2014, and the procedures set \nforth in Enclosure (Encl.) 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The \nconcerns raised are \u201ccriminal or dishonest conduct,\u201d under DODI 5200.46 and in DODI \n5200.46, Appendix (App.) 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2.    \n \n\n \n2 \nOn August 10, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), dated August 24, 2018, was provided to her by letter on August 27, \n2018. Applicant received the FORM on September 5, 2018. She was afforded a period \nof 45 days to file objections and supply additional information for consideration. \nApplicant timely submitted a two-page response to the FORM. On December 20, 2018, \nthe case was assigned to me. Department Counsel submitted six documents with her \nFORM, marked as Items 1 through 6. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is marked Item \n7. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old mechanic employed at a military installation since \nAugust 2017. She has been steadily employed since at least 2012 holding multiple jobs. \nApplicant was awarded an associate in applied science degree in avionics technology in \nMay 2015. She also holds an active medical certificate third class and student pilot \ncertificate.  \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \nCAC eligibility concerns were identified as a result of Applicant\u2019s five arrests \ninvolving physical altercations. In her SOR Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations. These allegations are further established by the evidence contained in the \nFORM. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e; Items 1 - 6) \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct follows: (1) in March 2011 (age 21), \narrested and charged with assault-domestic violence 3rd. Charge dismissed; (2) in \nNovember 2011 (age 21), arrested and charged with harassment. Charge dismissed; \n(3) in December 2011 (age 21), arrested and charged with simple assault, harassment, \nand domestic violence. Pled guilty to disorderly conduct and sentenced to six months of \nconfinement (suspended), ordered to pay court costs and fines, and complete two years \nof unsupervised probation; (4) in September 2012 (age 21), arrested and charged with \ndisorderly conduct and harassment after bench warrant had been issued. Charge \ndismissed; (5) in March 2015 (age 24), arrested and charged with assault 3rd, \nobstruction of government operation, and disorderly conduct. Pled guilty to charges and \nsentenced to six months of confinement (suspended), ordered to pay court costs and \nfines, and complete two years of unsupervised probation. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e; Items 1 - \n6) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant completed anger management \u2013 domestic violence group \ncounseling following her March 2015 arrest. She is in a stable relationship, has not been \ninvolved in further criminal conduct, and no longer associates with individuals involved \nin her past criminal conduct. (Item 2) Applicant has no record of disciplinary actions in \nher employee file, has received favorable performance evaluations, and was awarded \nher associate\u2019s degree. Lastly, and on her own initiative, she completed the \nrequirements to receive a medical certificate third class and student pilot certificate to \nfurther assist pilots in flight. Applicant requested to maintain her CAC eligibility to \n\n \n3 \ncontinue providing \u201cexcellent aircraft maintenance for the men and women\u201d on her \nmilitary installation. (Item 2) Post-FORM, Applicant submitted a comprehensive \nattendance log documenting her anger management - domestic violence counseling \nsessions completed in 2017. (Item 7) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Encl. 4, App. 1, Basic Adjudicative Standards, \nand App. 2, SAS. The overriding factor for all of these conditions is unacceptable risk. \nThe decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant of CAC eligibility \nis clearly consistent with the national interest.    \n \nThe objective of the CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility. In all \nadjudications, the protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. \nTherefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for CAC eligibility should \nbe resolved in favor of the national interest.  \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct  \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 2 describes the concern: \n \n2. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment . . . , or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may put people, property, \nor information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past criminal or dishonest \nconduct may put people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 2 indicates conditions that may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n\n \n4 \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include: \n \n(1) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put the safety \nof people at risk or threaten the protections of property or information. . . . ; \n \n(2) Charges or admissions of criminal conduct relating to the safety of \npeople and proper protection of property or information systems, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(5) Actions involving violence . . . of a criminal nature that poses an \nunacceptable risk if access is granted to federally-controlled facilities and \nfederally-controlled information systems.   \n \n \nBased on the evidence contained in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s criminal or \ndishonest conduct, SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (1), (2), and (5) are applicable. Further review is \nnecessary. \n \n \nSAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.c lists three circumstances relevant to the determination of whether \nthere is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk: \n \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \n \n(2) Charges were dismissed or evidence was provided that the person did \nnot commit the offense and details and reasons support his or her \ninnocence; and \n \n(4) Evidence has been supplied of successful rehabilitation, including but \nnot limited to remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, constructive community involvement, or passage of \ntime without recurrence. \n \n \nThe record supports full application of SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.c (1), (2), and (4). Four of \nApplicant\u2019s arrests occurred when she was 21 years old, and her last arrest in 2015 \noccurred when she was 24 years old. The charges following three of her arrests were \ndismissed. Her two convictions were pursuant to her pleading guilty. Applicant has \naccepted responsibility for her actions and has not attempted to minimize her culpability. \n \n \nApplicant has made a concerted effort to make positive changes in her life and \nrefrain from criminal conduct since her last arrest in March 2015. She was awarded her \nassociate\u2019s degree in May 2015, obtained an active medical certificate third class and \nstudent pilot certificate, and has avoided any further criminal conduct. She is no longer \non probation and completed all of her court-ordered counseling requirements in 2017. \nSince starting her current job in August 2015, Applicant has received favorable \nperformance evaluations and has no record of disciplinary actions in her employee file. \nCriminal or dishonest conduct concerns are mitigated. \n\n \n5 \nWhole-Person Assessment \n  \n \nDODI 5200.46, Encl. 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, \u00b6 1, Guidance For \nApplying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the following mitigating \nfactors: \n \nAs established in [HSPD-12], credentialing adjudication considers whether \nor not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally controlled \nfacilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination to \nauthorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in [U.S. Office of Personnel Management \nMemorandum, Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity \nVerification Cards Under HSPD-12, July 31, 2008].  \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious the \nconduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient information \nconcerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained to \ndetermine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural conditions \nmay be relevant to the determination of whether there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions are currently \nremoved or countered (generally considered in cases with relatively minor \nissues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n(a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \n\n \n6 \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n \n(b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not just \nalcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be a \nconsideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n  \nMy comments under the criminal or dishonest conduct analysis are incorporated \ninto this whole-person assessment. Applicant is a 28-year-old mechanic and has been \nemployed at a military installation for almost two years. She is making a contribution \ntowards the national defense. Her arrests occurred when she was relatively young. The \nevidence suggests that Applicant has come to grips with the fact that her past conduct \nis unacceptable, and she has successfully avoided engaging in any further criminal \nconduct. \n \n \n \nI have carefully considered the facts of this case and applied the standards in \nDODI 5200.46. For reasons discussed above, Applicant\u2019s request for CAC eligibility is \ngranted.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Encl. 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest \n    Conduct:  \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant CAC eligibility. CAC \neligibility is granted. \n \n                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual allegations in the SOR pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). She failed to address the factual allegations pertaining to the criminal conduct issues. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a systems administrator with her current employer since January 2016. A 2009 high school graduate, Applicant earned a number of college credits, but no degree. She enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in September 2009, and served on active duty until September 2013, when she was honorably discharged. She completed her military service commitment in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in August 2017. She was granted a secret clearance in November 2010. Applicant was married in December 2013, and separated in May 2016. She has two sons, born in October 2012, and sometime in 2018.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2013, and again on December 14, 2016, Applicant applied for \na security clearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) versions of a Security Clearance Application. On an unspecified date \nin 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of \ninterrogatories. She responded to those interrogatories on February 20, 2018. On May \n17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), (December 10, 2016), National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n  12/13/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) \nand J (Criminal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 4, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated June \n13, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on September 11, 2018, and she was \nafforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on September 18, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on November 2, 2018. Applicant timely submitted one \ndocument in response to the FORM, and it was admitted as an Applicant exhibit, without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). She \nfailed to address the factual allegations pertaining to the criminal conduct issues. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a systems administrator with her current employer since January 2016. A 2009 high \nschool graduate, Applicant earned a number of college credits, but no degree. She \nenlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in September 2009, and served on active duty \nuntil September 2013, when she was honorably discharged. She completed her military \nservice commitment in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in August 2017. She was \ngranted a secret clearance in November 2010. Applicant was married in December 2013, \nand separated in May 2016. She has two sons, born in October 2012, and sometime in \n2018. \n \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \n \nApplicant is an alcohol abuser whose consumption of alcohol has led to at least \nthree incidents over a five-year period that resulted in actions taken by police and court \nauthorities:  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n\u2022In November 2011, when she was on active duty, after being out drinking an \nunspecified quantity of beer at a bar with friends, Applicant drove onto her military facility \nwhile under the influence of alcohol and emitting the odor of alcohol, and she was \napprehended at the gate by the military police. She was administered a breathalyzer and \nfield-sobriety test. In December 2011, the traffic court on base assessed her 10 points to \nher driving record on base, and she was ordered to attend a one-day alcohol education \nprogram. She was eventually administratively counseled by her command with a write-up \nunder what is called a page 11 entry, declared ineligible for promotion for three months, \nand issued a reprimand.1 \n \n\u2022In March 2012, when she was on active duty, after being out drinking one shot of \nliquor, a mixed drink, and up to two beers at a bar with her sister, she decided to return \nto the military facility by taxi. While riding in the taxi, she passed out. The gate guards \ncould not awaken her, so she was transported to the base hospital. She was subsequently \nordered to undergo an alcohol screening. Based on the alcohol screening, Applicant was \nadvised to participate in outpatient treatment, but because she was pregnant, she \nrequested inpatient treatment. She was in the hospital treatment program from March 27, \n2012, until April 24, 2012, during which she participated in group counseling, was given \na smokers patch, and administered Melatonin to treat insomnia. No diagnosis was \nreported. She purportedly successfully completed the program \u201cby mutual decision,\u201d and \nwas discharged. The U.S. Navy medical office guided her through an outpatient follow-\nup from May 2012 until August 2012, during which she participated in individual therapy \nand individual therapy. There was no diagnosis. She purportedly successfully completed \nthat program \u201cby mutual decision,\u201d and was discharged.2 \n \n\u2022On July 2, 2016, at about 1 a.m., after being out drinking two beers and what she \ndescribed as a \u201ctrashcan\u201d3 at a caf\u00e9 with a friend, blaming the anniversary of her father\u2019s \npassing and the absence of her husband for her frame of mind, Applicant drove to her \nresidence. On the way there, Applicant\u2019s vehicle struck a tow truck stopped at a traffic \nsignal in a traffic lane, sideswiping it coming from the opposite direction. As a result of the \nimpact, a trail of debris, including the front left tire, most of the front bumper, and the \nlicense plate were left behind. Applicant drove away without exchanging any information \nwith the tow truck driver. He followed her at a fast rate of speed and called the police. The \npolice arrived just as Applicant and her companion were attempting to enter her house. \nHer damaged vehicle was out front. Applicant was questioned and acknowledged that \nshe had been drinking, and that she fled because she was scared. There was a strong \nodor of alcohol coming from her breath and person. She was administered field sobriety \n                                                          \n1 Item 5 (Personal Subject Interview, dated January 3, 2014), at 3, 5; Item 5 (Personal Subject \nInterview, dated August 1, 2017), at 5; Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated June 13, 2018), at 1. \n \n2 Item 5 (January 2014 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5-6; Item 5 (August 2017 \nPersonal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. It should be noted that although the medical records were \nrequested from the hospital, and Applicant authorized the release of those records, there are no such \nmedical or treatment records in the case file, and the specifics of the treatment remain unreported. \n \n3 The ingredients of a typical trashcan drink are: 1/2 ounce gin, 1/2 ounce vodka, 1/2 ounce triple \nsec, 1/2 ounce light rum, 1/2 ounce peach schnapps, 1/2 ounce blue curacao, and 1 full can Red Bull. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ntests and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). She was later \nadministered an intoxilizer test. Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI), first offense, with a blood alcohol reading of between .15 and .20 percent, a \nmisdemeanor; and failing to stop at an accident, a misdemeanor. On September 15, \n2016, she was found guilty of the DWI, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 85 days of \nwhich were suspended, ordered to attend an area alcohol safety program (ASAP), placed \non unsupervised probation for three years, fined, her operator\u2019s license was restricted, \nand an ignition interlock restriction was required. The remaining charge was dismissed \nnolle prosequi.4  \n \nApplicant claimed that she enrolled in the ASAP and attended weekly group \ntherapy meetings for 16 weeks, as well as a 4-week program, not otherwise described, \nending in March 2017. She also contends that she voluntarily attends Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings when she feels the need to do so.5  \n \nIn January 2014, Applicant acknowledged to an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) that she began consuming alcohol when she was \napproximately 18 years of age while attending high school parties. There were times \nwhen she would drink two to three beers on three or four occasions per week, and periods \nwhen she did not drink at all. Describing intoxication as being \u201cfuzzy headed\u201d and slurring \nwords, she acknowledged becoming intoxicated after consuming seven or eight beers, \nsomething she did weekly on average. She also acknowledged that she has become \nintoxicated after only three beers. Applicant drinks sometimes to deal with stress, and \nsometimes just to be social.6 In August 2017, she claimed to another OPM investigator \nthat she had no future intent to consume alcohol nor would she ever operate a vehicle \nwhile intoxicated. She denied that her drinking and driving incidents constituted a pattern, \nand contended that her 2016 incident was an \u201cisolated\u201d incident.7 In her Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant claims that she has attempted to turn her life around by avoiding being in \nsituations where alcohol is involved, by changing the friends with whom she associates, \nand by no longer drinking.8 In her Response to the FORM, Applicant reiterated her \nposition regarding alcohol. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n                                                          \n4 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 3-5; Item 6 (Sheriff\u2019s Incident \nReport, dated July 2, 2016); Item 7 (Court Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated September 15, 2016). \n \n5 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n6 Item 5 (January 2014 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6. \n \n7 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n8 Item 2, supra note 1, at 1-2. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d9 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d10   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d11 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.12  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \n                                                          \n9 Department of the Navy v.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set forth \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n                                                          \n13 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n14 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication on \nat least three occasions during the period November 2011 until July 2016, and that use \nof alcohol has led to a number of incidents that resulted in actions taken by police and \ncourt authorities. As a result of her alcohol consumption, she has been administratively \nreprimanded while in the USMC and convicted of DWI after her vehicle struck another \nvehicle and she drove away without exchanging any information. She has been ordered \nto attend a one-day alcohol education program, directed to participate in a hospital \nrehabilitation program, an outpatient aftercare program, and ASAP. While her \nconsumption of alcohol appears to be repetitive in nature, there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that such consumption constituted binge drinking status. Appellant purportedly \nsuccessfully completed the command-mandated and court-ordered programs and the \nrequirements of those programs. AG \u00b6 22(a) has been established, but none of the other \nconditions have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining conditions apply. Because \nof its relative recency, Applicant\u2019s 2016 alcohol-related incident \u2013 the one involving a DWI \nand a hit and run \u2013 is the most significant, as far as her security clearance review is \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nconcerned. Applicant\u2019s behavior, stemming from her association with alcohol, has not \nbeen infrequent, and the circumstances developed do not appear to be unusual. She had \nadmitted to repeated periods of intoxication over the years. While Applicant now \nacknowledges her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, for far too long she seemingly gave \nlip-service to it. She abstained briefly at times, but eventually returned to excessive \nalcohol use. She continued to abstain for longer periods when required to do so, like \nduring periods of treatment, but relapses continued to occur. Moreover, it is troubling that \nfor her most recent incident, Applicant seems to blame the anniversary of her father\u2019s \npassing and the absence of her husband for her DWI and hit and run incident. While \nApplicant now claims to be abstinent, she has failed to demonstrate a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. Even crediting her with her \npurported period of abstinence, which would be since July 2016, that period equates to \nonly two and one-half years, after nearly a decade of alcohol consumption and abuse.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed the series of alcohol-related programs that were \neither command-mandated or court-mandated. Despite her acknowledgement that AA is \na good program for her, she only attends meetings on an irregular basis, when she thinks \nshe needs to do so. Because of her history of maladaptive alcohol use, her relatively brief \nunsubstantiated period of abstinence, and her irregular attendance at AA, there remain \nsignificant questions as to whether such maladaptive alcohol use will recur. Nevertheless, \nApplicant should be encouraged to remain abstinent for a much longer period. She has \nfailed to demonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence, and under the circumstances, there remain doubts on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes three conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption is adopted herein. In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s court-mandated probation \u2013 a result of her July 2016 arrest and \nSeptember 2016 DWI conviction \u2013 is still in place, and does not expire until mid or late \n2019. Accordingly, based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) \nhave been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) partially applies. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Applicant has a multiple-\nincident history of criminal conduct, commencing in November 2011 and continuing \nperiodically until at least July 2016. She was arrested, and charged with a variety of \ncrimes, been reprimanded, spent time in jail, was fined, placed on probation, lost her \ndriver\u2019s license, and required to attend several treatment and educational programs. Over \nthat period, nothing seemed to work. She continued to blame a variety of situations or \nindividuals for her criminal involvement. There is limited unverified evidence of the \nsuccessful completion of various command-mandated or court-mandated programs.  \n \nWhile there is evidence that one particular charge was dismissed or otherwise not \nprosecuted, that dismissal and non-prosecution does not, without substantially more, \nnecessarily reflect that Applicant did not commit the individual offense charged. \nGenerally, the passage of time without recurrence of additional criminal activity can be \nconstrued as some evidence of successful rehabilitation. However, in this instance, the \nmost recent criminal activity was committed two and one-half years ago. While a person \nshould not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, in this instance the \npast is relatively recent, and the concerns about future criminal conduct are continuing. \nApplicant\u2019s past history of criminal conduct, under the circumstances, continues to cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.15  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 28-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a systems administrator \nwith her current employer since January 2016. She enlisted in the USMC in September \n2009, and served on active duty until September 2013, when she was honorably \ndischarged. She completed her military service commitment in the IRR in August 2017. \nShe was granted a secret clearance in November 2010. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant has consumed alcohol to intoxication on various occasions. She consumed \nalcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication on at least three occasions \nduring the period November 2011 until July 2016, and that use of alcohol has led to a \nnumber of incidents that resulted in actions taken by police and court authorities. As a \nresult of her alcohol consumption, she has been administratively reprimanded while in the \nUSMC and convicted of DWI after her vehicle struck another vehicle and she drove away \nwithout exchanging any information. She has been sentenced to jail, ordered to attend \nvarious alcohol-related programs, placed on unsupervised probation for three years, \nfined, her operator\u2019s license was restricted. She remains on probation. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct concerns. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG \n2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                                                          \n15 See U.S. v.

Applicant\u2019s 2014 return was filed in March 2016. His AGI was $241,567. He \nhad an account balance of $107,837 in unpaid taxes for this year:  \n \n6. Applicant\u2019s 2015 return was timely filed in April 2016. His AGI was $232,239. \nHe owed $8,463 in unpaid taxes for this year;1 and \n \n7. Applicant\u2019s 2016 return was filed in May 2017. His AGI was $85,143. He did \nnot owe taxes for this year.2 \n \n           According to the May 2018 IRS transcripts, Applicant owed $406,030 in unpaid \ntaxes for the above years. (GE 2) His post-hearing submission indicated that on August \n25, 2018, he paid the IRS $8,456 to resolve his 2015 tax debt. (AE A)  \n \n         In response to a question about the discrepancy between his testimony that he had \nnot filed tax returns for years 2010 through 2015, and the IRS\u2019s records indicating that he \nhad filed them, Applicant said he \u201cmight have [filed]\u201d but could not remember. (Tr. 53, 79-\n80) In a post-hearing submission, he stated the second company he hired to handle his \ntax returns filed the above-mentioned returns. (AE A)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he owed about $40,000 for his 2017 Federal taxes.3 To date \nhe has paid about $16,000 toward the 2017 tax debt (Tr. 48, 53, 62) He acknowledged \nthat he did not make estimated quarterly tax payments in 2017 or for other years when \nhe was an independent contractor. (Tr. 63, 73) \n \n \nApplicant has filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2017. \n(Tr. 54) As of December 14, 2018, he resolved a $57,791 tax debt he owed the state for \ndelinquent tax debts through a two-year payment plan. (Tr. 55-56; GE 3; AE B) \n \n                                            \n1 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2015 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his \nemployer. \n \n2 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2016 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his \nemployer. \n \n3 The SOR does not allege a security concern related to Applicant\u2019s unpaid 2017 Federal tax debt. Hence, \nit will not be discussed in analyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in the analysis of \nmitigating conditions and the whole-person concept, and in an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nIn 2013 or 2014, Applicant contacted the IRS to establish a payment plan for \nunpaid taxes for previous years, but he never entered into one. (Tr. 43) In December \n2018, he paid his 2015 Federal tax debt, but has not established a payment plan for tax \nyears 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. His large unpaid Federal income tax debt \nremains unresolved. He admitted that he has been neglectful. (Tr. 75) \n \n \nApplicant earns $140,000 annually from his current employer. He is an \nindependent contractor and is responsible for tax planning for the year. He said he puts \nabout 30% of his monthly income aside for taxes. (Tr. 56-57)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to file Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2010, 2013, and 2014, despite being aware of his duty to do so. He failed to timely file \nstate income tax returns for 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. He also failed to timely pay \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nFederal income taxes for years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, despite earning \na significant salary those years. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Federal income tax returns for 2010 to 2017 have been filed. His state \nincome tax returns for 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014 have also been filed and all \noutstanding state taxes have been resolved. Applicant continues to owe the IRS about \n$380,000 for unpaid Federal taxes for years 2010 through 2014 and 2017. His failure to \ntimely file income tax returns for several years and pay outstanding taxes continues to \ncast doubt on his judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant did not provide a \ncredible explanation for failing to timely file three years of Federal tax returns and four \nyears of state tax returns. He admitted that he had no valid reason for not responsibly \nmanaging and paying his taxes. His tax problems were within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot apply. \n \n Applicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling, and there is no \nevidence that his unpaid tax debt for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 is paid, being \npaid, resolved, or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He has not initiated a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his outstanding Federal tax debt for those five tax years. AG \u00b6 20(d) \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ndoes not apply. He recently resolved his 2015 Federal tax debt through a payment plan. \nHe established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) as to the 2015 debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 38-year-old man, who honorably served in the Army for \nmore than six years. Since 2005, he has worked for different defense contractors and \ncurrently he works for another Federal agency.  \n \nDuring his hearing, Applicant discussed his history of unfiled Federal and state \nincome tax returns and unpaid taxes, although he was unable to provide accurate \ninformation about the status of his tax filings. He has resolved all alleged state income \ntax filings and payment issues. His Federal income tax returns from 2010 to 2017 are \nnow filed and he has paid his 2015 Federal tax debt. However, he has a large unpaid \nFederal tax debt that accumulated because he did not pay estimated taxes for several \nyears, despite earning a high salary. He recognized his responsibility to resolve that tax \ndebt, but has taken minimal action to do so. Applicant has not established a plan to pay \nthat debt nor has he established a record of responsibly following tax laws and managing \nrelated financial obligations. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).4  \n   \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h:  \n \n        For Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n4 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 13, 2018, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written case \nwas submitted on April 11, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nreceived the FORM on April 27, 2018. Applicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2018. The Government\u2019s documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 5 are admitted in evidence without objection. Other than \nhis Answer to the SOR, admitted into evidence as Item 2, Applicant failed to submit any \nadditional documentation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 27 years old. He obtained a \nhigh-school diploma in 2009, and he attended some college from 2011 to 2012 but did \nnot earn a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense contractor since \nAugust 2016. He previously worked for another defense contractor from March 2015 to \nAugust 2016.

As of his August 2016 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and did not have any \nchildren.1   \n \n \nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of \nintoxication, since after he graduated from high school. When he was underage, he \ntypically drank two to four beers once to twice monthly at house parties. Between ages \n21 to 24, he drank around two to eight beers almost nightly while socializing with \nfriends. From ages 24 to 26, he decreased his alcohol consumption because he tried to \nbecome more responsible. He did not like the person he had become after receiving his \nsecond driving under the influence (DUI) charge in March 2015, as discussed below. He \nno longer enjoyed feeling hung over. As of his 2017 background interview, he \nconsumed five to six beers on the weekends while socializing with friends.2  \n \n \nIn March 2012, at age 20, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was \nat a party with a friend and he drank five to six beers. He thought he was in good \ncondition to drive, but he wrecked his car in a ditch on his way home. He failed a field \nsobriety test. He pled guilty and was sentenced to probation and fined. He was ordered \nto participate in an alcohol assessment, attend a victim impact panel, and enroll in an \nalcohol and drug substance abuse course. He completed the alcohol classes in \nSeptember 2012, and he was on probation from around August 2012 to June 2013. A \ncourt record corroborates Applicant\u2019s indication in his SCA and background interview \nthat this DUI was dismissed in around January 2013.3   \n \n \nIn February 2015, Applicant was terminated from employment due to multiple \nlate arrivals and absences. He indicated in his background interview that he likely had a \nweek\u2019s worth of late arrivals and three to four absences in the last several months of his \n                                                          \n1 Items 1-4.  \n \n2 Item 4. \n \n3 Items 1-5.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nemployment. He was late and absent because he partied and drank with friends at bars, \nwas hungover, tired, and did not feel like working.4 \n \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. He \nwas at a restaurant with a friend. Over the course of six to seven hours, he drank at \nleast 12 beers. As he was driving, he was stopped by a police officer for speeding. He \nfailed a field sobriety test. The speeding charge was dismissed. He pled guilty to DUI \nand was sentenced to jail for one year, suspended; probation for one year; license \nsuspension; and fined. He was again ordered to participate in an alcohol assessment, \nattend a victim impact panel, and enroll in an alcohol and drug substance abuse course. \nHe was also ordered to complete 80 hours of community service. He was on probation \nfrom September 2015 to June 2016, and he completed the court\u2019s requirements.5 \n \n \nIn November 2015, Applicant received a written warning from his employer. The \nwarning was for his failure to call or show for work. The previous evening, he was out \ndrinking and watching football with a friend. He overslept.6 \n \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication \nand resisting an officer. He and a friend were celebrating a holiday weekend at a bar, \nand he drank eight to nine beers and two shots of hard liquor. He walked back to his \napartment, which was around one mile from the bar, when he was arrested in his \napartment complex parking lot. He was difficult with the arresting officer because he \nwas drunk and upset. He pled no contest and was fined.7  \n \n \nIn his 2017 background interview, Applicant indicated that such alcohol-related \nincidents were unlikely to recur because he was a changed person. He indicated that he \nstopped drinking during the week and on Sundays because it interfered with work and \nhe did not like the person he was. He indicated that his family and friends are aware of \nhis alcohol-related incidents. He also indicated that he has never received an alcohol-\nrelated diagnosis.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n4 Items 1-4. \n \n5 Items 1-5. \n \n6 Items 1-4. \n \n7 Items 1, 2, 4. \n \n8 Item 4. \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the welfare \nand safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents away from work and at work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents did not happen under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. His \ntermination from one employer and warning from another in 2015 due to his alcohol-\nrelated conduct, his 2015 DUI conviction, and his 2017 public intoxication conviction are \nrecent and not mitigated by the passage of time. While he indicated that he has \nchanged his alcohol consumption, he has not yet demonstrated a clear pattern of \nmodified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in this whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 9, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on July 26, 2018. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 1, 2018. She \nresponded to the FORM with documents that I have marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nthrough F.1 The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2018. The Government \nexhibits included in the FORM and AE A through F are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \n \nOn January 28, 2019, I notified Applicant that I would reopen the record if she \nwanted to submit additional documentary evidence. I reopened the record upon her \nrequest. She submitted documents that I have marked AE G through J and admitted \nwithout objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2017. She attended college for a period, but she has not \nearned a degree. She is the single mother of two minor children.2 \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which are attributed primarily to \nunemployment, underemployment, her children\u2019s significant medical problems, and the \ncosts associated with being a single mother of two children without meaningful support \nfrom the children\u2019s father. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005, and her debts \nwere discharged in 2006.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 41 delinquent debts, including 28 medical debts and 13 \nmiscellaneous debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.v; 1.c and 1.p; \nand 1.d, 1.t, and 1.u are duplicate accounts. There are 27 non-duplicate medical debts \nand 10 non-duplicate miscellaneous debts. The debts are listed on a February 2016 \ncredit report, an October 2017 credit report, or both credit reports.4 \n \n \nThe ten non-duplicate miscellaneous debts total about $4,350 and include debts \nto telecommunications companies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$1,058; 1.d-$435; and 1.bb-$371); \nbanks (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-$694; and 1.f-$366); a public utility (SOR \u00b6 1.i-$938); a returned \ncheck (SOR \u00b6 1.hh-$60); a toll bridge (SOR \u00b6 1.oo-$54); and two retail accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.cc-$165; and 1.gg-$212). \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in January 2018. She \nenrolled four debts totaling $6,675 in the company\u2019s debt-settlement program (DSP), \nincluding the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The three additional debts are owed to two \nfinancial institutions ($2,075 and $1,200) and a hospital ($2,500). It is difficult to ascribe \nthe three debts to any of the debts alleged in the SOR, although the hospital debt could \n                                                          \n1 AE F is a copy of the Government\u2019s FORM. \n \n2 Items 4, 5; AE A. \n \n3 Items 2, 5, 8, 9; AE A, C. \n \n4 Items 6, 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nbe connected to one or more SOR debts. The DSP documentation called for Applicant \nto pay $252 per month for 18 months, plus $59 per month in fees.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.bb. She wrote in her response to the SOR for all four debts: \u201cI \nhave made payment arrangements with a debt consolidation company.\u201d She wrote In \nher response to the FORM: \n \nI finally landed a full time position last year. Since working full time I was \nable to move into my own apartment. I have been trying desperately to \npay off my debts and maintain a household for me and my children. Many \nof the debt[s] in question ha[ve] already been paid. Some of which are no \nlonger on my credit reports. I also contacted a debt consolidation company \nto work out a payment plan. . . . I will continue to work on paying off all of \nmy debt as quickly as possible. \n \n \nApplicant provided credit reports with her response to the SOR and FORM, but \nno actual proof of payments. I reopened the record for her to submit additional \ndocumentation. She responded that she was no longer working with the debt-settlement \ncompany because it was too much money. On January 29, 2019, she retained a law \nfirm to repair her credit and dispute inaccurate items on her credit report. She stated \nthat she is paying the law firm $109 per month. She also documented that on February \n27, 2019, she paid the $435 debt to the telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.d).6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $938 public utilities debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but \nshe wrote that she was \u201ccurrently making payments to [the utility company] on this \naccount.\u201d The debt was reported by Experian on the February 2016 combined credit \nreport, but it is not listed on the February 2018 Experian credit report.7 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.cc, 1.gg, 1.hh, and 1.oo. She stated that she was unaware of the $165 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.cc. The debt was reported by Equifax on the February 2016 combined credit \nreport, but it is not listed on the October 2017 Equifax credit report, nor any other credit \nreport.8 \n \n \nApplicant stated that she paid the $212 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.gg. The debt \nwas reported with a $212 balance on the February 2016 combined credit report. The \nFebruary 2018 Experian credit report and the March 2018 TransUnion credit report, \nwhich were submitted by Applicant, also report the account with a $212 balance.9 \n                                                          \n5 Items 2, 3. \n \n6 Items 2, 3; AE E, G-J. \n \n7 Items 2, 3, 6, 7: AE E. \n \n8 Items 2, 3, 6, 7; AE E. \n \n9 Items 2, 3, 6; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $60 debt for a returned check (SOR \u00b6 1.hh). She \nstated that her credit union was hacked during the time the check was being processed. \nThe debt was reported by Experian on the February 2016 combined credit report and on \nthe three credit reports from February and March 2018. On July 18, 2018, she sent a \nletter to the creditor requesting verification of the account and deletion from her credit \nreport if not verified. No additional information on its status was provided.10 \n \n \nApplicant stated that she paid the $54 debt for a toll bridge (SOR \u00b6 1.oo). The \ndebt was reported by TransUnion on the February 2016 combined credit report. It is not \nreported on any subsequent report.11 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing some of the medical debts, while denying owing the \nrest. Some of the debts have been removed from her credit report, but there is no other \nevidence that any of the medical debts have been paid.12 \n \n \nCredit reports indicate that Applicant paid or settled a $188 debt and a $402 debt \nthat were not alleged in the SOR. The February 2016 credit report lists a $19,671 \ndeferred student loan. The balance had increased to $26,966 on the October 2017 \ncredit report. The loan is reported in March 2018 as deferred with a $27,366 balance. \nThe deferment was scheduled to end in May 2018.13   \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                          \n10 Items 2, 3, 6; AE B, E. \n \n11 Items 2, 3, 6, 7; AE E. \n \n12 Items 2, 3, 6, 7; AE D, E. \n \n13 Items 3, 6-8. AE E, J. The SOR appropriately did not allege the deferred student loan nor the two paid \ncollection debts. The student loan will be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation. \nThe paid collection accounts are matters in mitigation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.v; 1.c and 1.p; and 1.d, 1.t, and 1.u are \nduplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v, 1.p, 1.t, \nand 1.u are concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems primarily to unemployment, \nunderemployment, her children\u2019s significant medical problems, and the costs associated \nwith being a single mother of two children without meaningful support from the \n\n \n7 \n \nchildren\u2019s father. Those events qualify as conditions that were largely beyond her \ncontrol.  \n \n \nApplicant paid or settled a $188 debt and a $402 debt before the SOR was \nissued. When she responded to the SOR and FORM, she indicated that she was paying \nher debts through a debt-settlement program. Only one of the four debts in the DSP can \nbe positively ascribed to any of the debts alleged in the SOR. She wrote that she would \n\u201ccontinue to work on paying off all of [her] debt as quickly as possible.\u201d I reopened the \nrecord to provide her the opportunity to submit additional documentation. She did not \nmaintain the DSP. Instead, on January 29, 2019, she retained a law firm to repair her \ncredit and dispute inaccurate items on her credit report. On February 27, 2019, she paid \nthe $435 debt to the telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that several debts were paid, and she disputed owing other \ndebts. Some debts have been removed from her credit reports. Other than the three \ndebts discussed in the above paragraph, there is no proof that any of the debts have \nactually been paid. Nonetheless, I am crediting Applicant with mitigation for all the \nmedical debts and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.cc, and 1.oo. \n \n \nEven with reopening the record and giving Applicant credit in mitigation as \ndiscussed above, I am left with unanswered questions and lingering security concerns. I \nknow little about the current state of her finances, such as whether and how she plans \nto pay the debts that are her responsibility.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

His request for \ncontinued security clearance eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 26, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor.

Applicant timely responded to the SOR \n(Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on August 9, 2018, and convened the requested hearing on \nNovember 29, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA \u2013 D. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $43,404 for ten \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). Under Guideline J, it was alleged that on \nFebruary 28, 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with first-degree assault and use \nof a firearm (SOR 2.a). Applicant admitted with explanations and supporting documents \nall of the SOR allegations. In his e-QIP, he disclosed most of the information addressed \nin the SOR, and the Government\u2019s exhibits support each of the SOR allegations. (Answer; \nGX 1 \u2013 4) In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and is \nworking toward his master\u2019s degree in that field. He also recently obtained several work-\nrelated certifications in the information technology (IT) field. Since at least 2006, he has \nworked for several companies in IT positions, including federal contractors in positions \nthat require a security clearance. He most recently held a top secret clearance with \neligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). Applicant attributes \nhis financial problems to a period of unemployment and under-employment after he was \nlaid off in February 2013. Applicant\u2019s employer lost a contract for classified work and could \nnot retain him. Applicant was unable to find IT work that required a TS/SCI clearance and \nhad to settle for a variety of jobs, both in IT and others, that did not last long and which \ndid not pay very well. Applicant reports being unemployed for all of 2014. In September \n2015, he was hired as a desktop analyst by the company that sponsored his current \napplication for clearance. (Answer; GX 1; AX D; Tr. 8) \n \n \nBefore he was laid off in 2013, Applicant had no difficulty meeting all of his financial \nobligations and was financially well-off, earning as much as $95,000 annually at one time. \nIn late 2011, he started his own marketing business while still working full-time. To support \nhis business venture, he relied on credit and overdraft protection accounts he had opened \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nat his credit union between 2005 and 2011. Those accounts were in good standing until \nabout September 2013, when they became delinquent. They are addressed in SOR 1.a \n\u2013 1.d. Since late 2016, Applicant has been making nominal monthly payments on those \ndebts as part of an organized effort to resolve all of his debts. He has paid the debt at \nSOR 1.d. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX C; Tr. 48, 72 \u2013 75) \n \n \nApplicant also established in his response to the SOR that he has paid the debts \nat SOR 1.f \u2013 1.i, and that he consistently is making monthly payments to the debt at SOR \n1.e according to a settlement plan he negotiated with that creditor. The debt at SOR 1.j \narose from injuries suffered in a car accident that was not Applicant\u2019s fault. At the time it \nhappened, Applicant did not have medical insurance. He is currently waiting for proceeds \nto be paid in response to a claim he filed against the other driver\u2019s insurance. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant was earning about $65,000 annually and had no financial problems \nbefore he was laid off in 2013. In October 2015, he found work that paid him enough to \nmove out of his parents\u2019 home and to buy a car. Since then, he has paid his rent and car \nloan as required. Applicant also presented information showing he completed a well-\nknown financial management course that has helped him effectively attack his debts and \nreduce his expenses. Using the lessons from that course, Applicant paid off those debts \nthat were within his means to do so; he negotiated with his creditors to establish \nrepayment agreements; and he has positioned himself to start paying more money to \nSOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, the largest of his remaining debts. Applicant adheres to a detailed monthly \nbudget and has eschewed building savings in favor of paying his debts. (Answer; Tr. 46 \n\u2013 72, 75 \u2013 81) \n \n \nOn February 28, 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with first-degree \nassault and use of a firearm. The charges were brought by Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend \nand stemmed from an argument they had the day before. Both parties had called the \npolice as the argument escalated, but no arrests were made that day. Applicant denied \nassaulting his ex-girlfriend, claiming instead that she repeatedly struck him on the back \nof the head as he was leaving her house. He required medical attention that evening. He \nadmits he damaged his ex-girlfriend\u2019s cell phone during the altercation. He also admits \nhe legally owns a registered firearm, but avers it was at his parents\u2019 house, where he lived \nat the time. His ex-girlfriend decided that evening to file a criminal complaint against \nApplicant, and local sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Applicant at his house on February 28, \n2016. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; AX A; Tr. 20 \u2013 46) \n \n \nApplicant never appeared at a hearing to answer the charges, which he has \nadamantly denied. On July 26, 2016, prosecutors dismissed the charges as being \nunsupported by any evidence. Available information also shows that Applicant\u2019s ex-\ngirlfriend has filed numerous other groundless complaints against other boyfriends and \nagainst family members. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 63 \u2013 68) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established Applicant accrued the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR. When the SOR was issued, most of those debts had not been resolved. That \ninformation reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). By contrast, Applicant established that his financial problems arose \nfrom unexpected periods of unemployment and under employment starting in February \n2013. In response to those circumstances, Applicant took whatever work he could, while \nat the same time reducing his living and other expenses. In late 2015, he was able to earn \nenough money to support himself and begin addressing his debts. He has been \naddressing most of his debts since 2016, and he has paid five of the debts alleged in the \nSOR. Of the remaining five debts, he is in repayment of four debts through plans \nnegotiated with those creditors. The debt at SOR 1.j is a medical debt likely to be satisfied \nthrough insurance payment from the at-fault driver in a recent accident with Applicant. \n \nApplicant also showed that he completed a well-known financial management \ncourse. He is acting on the lessons learned from that course by managing his finances \nthrough a detailed monthly budget. He also has significantly reduced expenses in order \nto pay down his debts in a reliable and systematic way before setting aside money for \nsavings. All of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant was arrested as alleged in the SOR. \nThat information reasonably raised a security concern about criminal conduct that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe only specific disqualifying condition to be considered here is at AG \u00b6 31(b) \n(evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters \nof official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally \ncharged, prosecuted, or convicted). Available information showed that Applicant was, in \nfact, charged with assault and a firearm offense. However, the record does not contain a \npolice report or other reliable information about what Applicant did or did not do. By \ncontrast, Applicant established that the charges were dismissed before trial. Applicant \nhas no further connection to his accuser and it is unlikely that the circumstances leading \nto that altercation will recur. AG \u00b6 31(b) does not apply because available information \ndoes not include evidence or even a credible allegation of wrongdoing by Applicant. \n \nIn the alternative, this record requires application of the following mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 32(c) (no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense). I conclude that all available information probative of this issue shows that any \nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s arrest are mitigated. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Particularly noteworthy is the information regarding Applicant\u2019s response to \nadverse financial circumstances. It reflects well on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. A \nfair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his \nhistory of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non August 4, 2017. This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 9, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2018. He admitted all but one of the \nallegations, and he provided some brief explanations. He also requested an in-person \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on August 9, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on October 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on October 25, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4 and A-H, respectively. No \nwitnesses other than Applicant were called.  \n \nThe record was kept open until November 25, 2018, to allow Applicant an \nopportunity to provide additional documentary evidence. He made a timely submission, \nand the post-hearing matters (tax records from the IRS) are admitted without objections \nas Exhibits I-K.   \n \nRuling on Procedure \n \nAt the close of evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding two allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state and federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015 as well as failure to timely pay \nfederal income tax as required for those tax years. (Tr. 73-77) Applicant objected \nbecause he did not have documentation concerning the federal tax matters. I overruled \nthe objection, but granted Applicant an additional 30 days, until November 25, 2018, to \nprovide relevant documentation. Accordingly, the SOR was amending by adding the \nfollowing: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m\u2014You failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2015; and \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n\u2014You failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2015, and you failed to timely pay federal income tax when due for those tax \nyears.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a transportation operations specialist. He has been so \nemployed since March 2016.

Additional evidence establishing the SOR allegations is found in the \ndocumentary evidence.   \n \nOverall, Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to the unexpected \ncircumstances that occurred in 2011, the three periods of unemployment, and the two \npart-time jobs he had before returning to full-time employment in 2016. The unexpected \ncircumstances in 2011 consisted of an incident where he was stabbed in the back \n(resulting in only minor injuries) while in a bar, and injuries sustained in two car \naccidents resulting in a strained neck and a bruised spine. (Tr. 39-41). \n  \nThe six delinquent student loans are now held by two different entities. Applicant \nobtained the loans while earning his bachelor\u2019s degree from August 2003 to May 2008. \nThree accounts, with a total balance due of $56,919 as of July 2018, are held by a debt-\ncollection company contracted by the current creditor. (Exhibit B) The debt-collection \ncompany offered Applicant the opportunity to enter into a repayment plan with a \nreduced interest rate in August 2017 as well as a lump-sum settlement offer of $5,490 in \nJuly 2018, but he was unable to accept either offer. He attempted to obtain a loan so he \ncould accept the lump-sum offer, but he was unable to do so. (Tr. 69-71) \n \nThe other three student loans, which were obtained from the Department of \nEducation, are now in a repayment arrangement. (Exhibits C and D). Initially, Applicant \nwas required to make a series of payments to rehabilitate the loans, completed in June \n2018, which qualified his accounts for transfer to one of the Department of Education\u2019s \nloan servicers. A loan transfer of $7,727, with a principal balance of $6,964, was made \nin June 2018. Applicant made payments in July, August, September, and October 2018.  \n \nConcerning the five delinquent consumer accounts, one is repaid, three are in a \nrepayment arrangement, and one is unresolved. Applicant paid the $1,387 collection \naccount, stemming from a mobile-phone account, in full in September 2018. (Exhibit F) \nHe is using the services of a consumer-credit-counseling firm to repay three accounts. \n(Exhibit E) The arrangement began in April 2018, and he made monthly payments of \n$108 in April, May, June, July, August, and October 2018. Applicant denied the $346 \ncollection account in his answer to the SOR, but he acknowledged in his hearing \ntestimony that the debt was his and stemmed from automobile insurance. (Tr. 57-60) He \n\n \n4 \n \nfurther explained that he contacted the debt-collection company, they had no record of \nthe account and advised him to dispute the account, which he said he is doing.  \n \nApplicant fell behind on his state and federal income tax obligations during his \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment during 2011 through 2015. He altered \nhis tax withholding to maximize his income during that period. He did not file tax returns \nbecause he knew he would owe money he could not then afford to pay. Applicant filed \nall the past-due state and federal income tax returns in January 2017, along with his \nreturns for tax year 2016. He also entered into repayment arrangements with both the \nstate tax authority and the IRS.  \n \nConcerning the state, he reached a payment agreement in April 2018 on a \nbalance of $2,773 for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. (Exhibits G and H) He agreed to \nmake $200 monthly payments and has done so through October 2018. He estimated \nowing about $1,000. (Tr. 36)  \n \nConcerning the IRS, he entered into an installment agreement in August 2017 for \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. (Exhibit I). He agreed to make $200 \nmonthly payments beginning on September 15, 2017. He made seven monthly \npayments, for a total of $1,400, from October 2017 to June 2018. (Exhibit J). Those \npayments reduced the balance to $2,788 from $4,379 as of July 2018. The most recent \naccount statement from November 2018 shows he owes $2,982 for balances due for \ntax years 2012 and 2017. (Exhibit K)   \n \nApplicant stated that he earned an annual salary of about $59,000. He further \nstated that he had no money in the bank or other financial institution, although he was \nparticipating in his employer\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. He does not use a credit card and \nmanages his finances with a debit card connected to his checking account.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is in a difficult situation where he is dealing with a large amount of \nindebtedness with a number of creditors or collectors. His problematic financial history \nis traceable to unexpected circumstances in 2011 when he was injured in two car \naccidents, and he then began a years-long period of periodic unemployment and part-\ntime employment, which only ended in March 2016 when he began his current job. \nSince then, he\u2019s done a decent job addressing a number of the delinquent debts. Three \nof the student loans were rehabilitated and are now in a repayment arrangement. He \npaid off one of the consumer debts and placed three accounts in a repayment \narrangement. He also filed all the past-due state and federal income tax returns in \nJanuary 2017 (before the SOR was issued), and he reduced the balances owed for \nback taxes via repayment arrangements with the state and federal tax authorities.  \n \n \nUnfortunately, the largest delinquent debts, the three student loans for more than \n$50,000, remain wholly unresolved. That is a sizeable amount of money. Moreover, I \nconsider nonpayment of student loans a serious matter, akin to nonpayment of income \ntax or court-ordered child support. Applicant has neither a realistic plan nor the means \nto address the loans. I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, and note than he has made progress in repaying debt and fixing his tax \nproblems. Nevertheless, the evidence is not sufficient to fully mitigate the security \nconcern stemming from his long-standing history of financial problems, which is ongoing \nand likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \n\n \n7 \n \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

His request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn July 19, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (Item 3). \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B for foreign influence. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based \non information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2018 (Answer), and requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.\n(Item 2.) On August 14, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \n01/22/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing four Items, \nwas received by him on September 17, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that he had \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. He did not respond within the time \nallotted. On January 16, 2019, the case was assigned to me. Items 1 through 3 are \nadmitted into evidence.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nSudan. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of the facts, supported by \nfive Government documents pertaining to Sudan, marked as Item 4. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of \nFact. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. The facts are as follows: \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He was born in Sudan and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom a university in Sudan. He immigrated to the United States in 2005 and was \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2010. He is married and has one child. Applicant has \nbeen employed by a government contractor since October 2014. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident in Sudan. She has never been to the \nUnited States. She works as a teacher in Sudan, for the Ministry of Education. Applicant \nhas applied for her to immigrate to the United States. Applicant and his wife have a five-\nyear-old child, who resides in Sudan with Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant communicates with \nhis wife and child on a weekly basis. He sends them $200 in support monthly. (Answer; \nItem 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents in Sudan. His father is 84 years old \nand his mother is 64 years old. They are cared for by Applicant\u2019s younger brother, who \nis also a citizen and resident of Sudan. In addition to caring for their parents, Applicant\u2019s \nyounger brother is a student. (Answer; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four sisters are citizens and residents in Sudan. They are married and \nApplicant has casual and infrequent contact with them. (Answer; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents in Sudan. \nHis father-in-law is 62 years old and is employed by the Ministry of Health in Sudan. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is approximately 54 years old and is a homemaker. (Answer; \nItem 3.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident in Sudan. He is employed  by \nthe Sudanese Ministry of Interior. Applicant reported that his contact with them is \u201cvery \ncasual and infrequent.\u201d (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident in Sudan. She is married to a \nSudanese man. Applicant reported that his contact with them is \u201cvery casual and \ninfrequent.\u201d (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a friend from Sudan that resides in Egypt. His \nfriend lives as a refugee in Egypt, after fleeing Darfur. He cannot return to Sudan \u201cfor he \nwill be in danger if he chooses to go back.\u201d (Answer.) He is \u201ccurrently working on \nestablishing citizenship other than Sudan.\u201d (Answer; Item 3.)  \n \nSudan \n \n \nSudan is governed by an authoritarian President. The National Congress Party \nhas held near-absolute power in Sudan for almost 30 years. Since 1993, Sudan has \nbeen designated by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, due to \nconcerns about Sudanese support to international terrorist organizations including Abu \nNidal Organization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The U.S. \nDepartment of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Sudan due to risks of terrorism, \narmed conflict, and violent crime. Westerners and Western interests are targeted \nthrough suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. Violent crimes \ntargeting Westerners including kidnappings, armed robberies, home invasions, and \ncarjacking occur throughout Sudan. Arbitrary detentions of foreigners have been \nreported. \n \n \nIn 2003, non-Arabs in the Darfur region of Sudan rebelled against the Sudanese \ngovernment, protesting decades of political and economic neglect. The government \nresponded with brutal force, and more than 300,000 people were killed in the ensuing \nconflict. More than two million people have been displaced as a result of that conflict. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife, parents, parents-in-law, siblings, and siblings-in-law are all \ncitizen and residents in Sudan. His ties to his Sudanese friend in Egypt also create a \nrisk of exploitation, should his friend return to Sudan. His wife is employed by the \nMinistry of Education. His father-in-law works for the Ministry of Health. His brother-in-\nlaw works for the Ministry of Interior. There is an articulated heightened risk associated \nwith having relationships with family members in or tied to Sudan, due to Sudan\u2019s \nsponsorship of terrorism, its authoritarian government, and the threats to Westerners in \nSudan. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nNone of the above conditions are mitigating in this instance. Applicant is in close \ncontact with his wife and child, communicating with them weekly and sending them \nmoney monthly. While his contacts with the rest of his family and his friend are less \nfrequent, they are still bonds that tie him to Sudan. A potential for a conflict of interest is \npresent due to his ties to his family in Sudan, the nature of the Sudanese government, \nand the unrest in Sudan. He failed to demonstrate deep and longstanding loyalties to \nthe United States. The record contains little information on assets, or physical or \nemotional bonds to the United States. Without more information, it cannot be \ndetermined that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for foreign influence. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Schachter, Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \nMay 22, 2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 13, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines B and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 28, 2018 (Answer); which included \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A1~B2, and eventually requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Notice of Representation.) The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on March 8, 2019, scheduling the hearing for April 23, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted into evidence, and GX 5 for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf. Applicant presented 34 documents, which I marked AppXs C1~L, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere also admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nMay 6, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a seven-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by 11 Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan, identified \nas GX 5. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 16.) He has been employed as a linguist with the defense contractor since January \nof 2017. (GX 1 at page 16.) In August of 2017, while on patrol with U.S. Marines, \nApplicant was wounded by a suicide bomber. (TR at page 38 line 14 to page 40 line 25, \nat page 82 lines 6~25, and AppX C1.) He has submitted eight letters of support (AppXs \nA, E and J), to include one from a Brigadier General (AppX E5), and numerous \nCertificates of Appreciation (AppX H1~9). \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denied that his mother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, as \nshe is now deceased. (TR at page 43 lines 16~18, and at page 44 lines 2~6.) This \noccurred in January of 2018, and Applicant could not attend her funeral as he could not \nleave the protection of his military post. (Id.)  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that three brothers are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. (TR at page 50 line 10 to page 52 line 3, and at page 53 line 14 to page 55 \nline 6.) Two of these brothers are merchants, and the third a teacher. (Id.) To the best of \nhis knowledge and belief none of these brothers are connected to the Afghan \ngovernment. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that a fourth brother, also a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan, was a \u201cClerk\u201d for the Afghan government. (TR at page 52 line 4 to page 53 \nline 12.) He is currently unemployed, but most recently worked for a U.S. company. (TR \nat page 55 lines 7~21, and at page 69 lines 7~23.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that between 2010~2016, he gave a total of about $5,000 \nto a brother, in support of his, now deceased, mother. Applicant disclosed this financial \n\n \n3 \n \nsupport to the U.S. Government, in January of 2011, as evidenced by his \nCounterintelligence-Focused Security Screening Questionnaire (CFSSQ). (TR at page \n42 line 7 to page 43 line 18, at page 55 line 22 to page 56 line 11, and GX  at page 7.) \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \n2.a. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d on his February 2017 e-QIP to the question: \u201cHave \nyou EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?\u201d (GX 1 at page 51.) He \nmistakenly thought this question did not apply to his immediate family. (TR at page 56 \nline 12 to page 60 line 6, and at page 71 line 1 to page 74 line 24.) Applicant had \nalready disclosed his mother\u2019s financial support, through his brother, in his January \n2011 CFSSQ. He reaffirmed his 2011 admission, just 12 days after he executed his e-\nQIP, when he again executed a February 2017 CFSSQ. (GX 4 at pages 1 and 2.) I find \nno willful falsification, here. \n \n \n2.b. Applicant admits that he resided in the United States illegally from about \n2006~2010. In about 2003, as an 18 year old, he started working as an interpreter for \nU.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (TR at page 22 lines 5~13, and at page 28 line 21 to page \n31 line 12.) In 2006, while Applicant was training in the United States, he discovered he \nwas on a \u201chit list\u201d if and when he returned to Afghanistan. (Id, and 60 line 7 to page 61 \nline 9, and at page 68 line 11 to page 69 line 2.)  As a result, he went to live with a half-\nbrother in California from 2006~2010. (Id.) Applicant disclosed his illegal status when he \napplied for and was granted a Green Card. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 36 line 11, \nand at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 13.) He was again deployed back to Afghanistan in \nsupport of U.S. forces, and while there applied for and was granted U.S. citizenship. \n(Id.) \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following regarding Afghanistan. A U.S. \nDepartment of State Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremist groups \nand kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals. Decades of disorder \nand warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terroism.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n \n4 \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n5 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n  \nApplicant has siblings who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, and he is \non a Taliban \u201chit list.\u201d The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee. \n \n \nApplicant is putting his life at risk as an interpreter for U.S. Forces. He was \nalmost killed by a suicide bomber, but has returned to Afghanistan in service of his \n\n \n6 \n \ncountry. His connection with his foreign relatives is clearly outweighed by his service \nand allegiance to the United States. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant. \n  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nApplicant arguably failed to answer his February 2017 e-QIP correctly. He was \nalso in the United States illegally for about four years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment \n \n \nApplicant disclosed to the Government, in 2011 and again in February of 2017; \nthe fact that he was providing financial aid to his mother, when he executed his \nCFSSQs. In light of these disclosures, he clearly misinterpreted the e-QIP\u2019s question. \nMore than nine years ago, Applicant feared for his life; and as a result, resided in the \nUnited States illegally for about four years. He is now a U.S. citizen, and is putting his \nlife at risk serving his country in Afghanistan. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant has a distinguished record of serving U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, as \nevidenced by those serving with him, to include a Brigadier General. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 32-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense contractor since 2017. He is currently working at an overseas location supporting the U.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in 2016 and is applying to maintain his security clearance. Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He received an associate\u2019s degree from a technical college in Iraq. He worked as a contract linguist/ translator/cultural advisor with the U.S. military in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and in 2011. In 2009, a local terrorist group threatened Applicant. He applied for and was granted a special immigrant visa (SIV). He immigrated to the United States in October 2011. He became U.S. citizen in 2016. He is married, but is separated from his wife and has no children. (Tr. 22-26, 51; Gov 1; AE C; AE G; AE H; Response to SOR) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy.

During his periods of unemployment, he lived off savings and received some help from his parents. His two brothers immigrated to the U.S. in 2013. Applicant lived with his two brothers for about a year. They had a falling out in May 2014, and Applicant has had no contact with his brothers since that time",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n  \n \nOn March 28, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 15, \n2019. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2019. On June 11, 2019, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 31, 2019.  Applicant worked at an \noverseas location and traveled back to the United States for hearing. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered nine exhibits. \nGovernment exhibits 1-9 were admitted without objection. Applicant offered 17 exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 Q, without objection. The \nGovernment and the Applicant requested administrative notice be taken of certain facts \nregarding the country of Iraq. I re-marked the administrative notice documents as  \n\n2 \n \nAdministrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I \u2013 Government) and Admin Not II \n(Applicant). The transcript was received on August 9, 2019. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nAdministrative Notice  -  Iraq  \n \n \nA coalition of countries led by U.S. and British forces invaded Iraq on March 20, \n2003. Dictator Saddam Hussein was deposed and on May 12, 2003, the United States \nestablished the Coalition Provisional Authority as the interim civil authority in Iraq. About \none year later, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred sovereignty to the new \nInterim Iraqi Government led by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Throughout the governance \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority and the peaceful transfer of power, the role of Iraqi \ninterpreters was vital to U.S. military success. Recognizing the role of local Iraqi \ninterpreters \u2013 and the dangers they faced as a result of their assistance to the United \nStates \u2013 Congress authorized a \u201cSpecial Immigrant Visa\u201d program that allowed local \ninterpreters who served with distinction to immigrate to the United States.  \n \n \nSince 2005, the U.S. government has approved more than $18.6 billion worth of \nforeign military sales to Iraq. U.S. security assistance supports the development of a \nmodern, accountable, and professional Iraqi military capable of defending Iraq and its \nborders. U.S. security assistance programs also promote civilian oversight of the \nmilitary, adherence to the rule of law, and the respect for human rights, while \nsimultaneously increasing the Iraqi military\u2019s capability to respond to threats and \ncounter-terrorism operations. The U.S. Embassy Baghdad maintains the Office of \nSecurity Cooperation \u2013 Iraq to further these goals and to facilitate Iraq\u2019s role as a \nresponsible security partner, contributing to the peace and security of the region.  \n \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very \ndangerous and the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely \nlimited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups \nregularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also \nthreaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq.   \n \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.  \n\n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor since 2017.  He is currently working at an overseas location supporting the \nU.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in 2016 and is applying to maintain \nhis security clearance. Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He received an \nassociate\u2019s degree from a technical college in Iraq. He worked as a contract linguist/ \ntranslator/cultural advisor with the U.S. military in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and in 2011. In \n2009, a local terrorist group threatened Applicant. He applied for and was granted a \nspecial immigrant visa (SIV). He immigrated to the United States in October 2011. He \nbecame U.S. citizen in 2016. He is married, but is separated from his wife and has no \nchildren. (Tr. 22-26, 51; Gov 1; AE C; AE G; AE H; Response to SOR) (Note: The facts \nin this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or \nlocations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain \nmore specific information.)  \n \nWhen Applicant first immigrated to the United States, he worked several jobs and \nendured several periods of unemployment. During his periods of unemployment, he \nlived off savings and received some help from his parents. His two brothers immigrated \nto the U.S. in 2013.  Applicant lived with his two brothers for about a year. They had a \nfalling out in May 2014, and Applicant has had no contact with his brothers since that \ntime. Applicant had a brief marriage in 2014, which was annulled. (Tr. 47-57; Gov 1; \nResponse to SOR)  \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army as an active-duty translator. \nHe learned how to operate in a dangerous environment. He was trusted to interpret \nconversations, documents, and other forms of communications to assist the U.S. \nmilitary. He trained Iraqi armed forces, he worked with high profile individuals, and was \ninvolved in tactical missions, some of which resulted in attacks in some of the most \ndangerous locations in Iraq. In June 2017, he was discharged from the U.S. Army for \nmedical reasons with a discharge characterized as Honorable. After being discharged \nfrom the U.S. Army, he was hired as a contract linguist in 2017. (Tr. 23; Gov 1; AE B; \nAE F; Response to SOR)  \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe SOR raises security concerns because Applicant has family members who \nare citizens of Iraq and several who reside in Iraq. Specifically: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a:  Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Iraq and Canada and resides \nin Canada.  Applicant admits that his wife is a dual citizen of Iraq and Canada.  They \nmarried in April 2016.  Applicant\u2019s spouse did not like that Applicant was always \ndeployed and never home. They are informally separated. Applicant does not know \nwhere his spouse currently resides. His last contact with her was around November \n2017. Once he locates where she is, he intends to file for divorce because they both \nwant different things out of life. (Tr. 26-27, 57-62; Gov 1 at 33-34; Response to SOR)  \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b:  Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She is retired and \nwas formerly employed by an Iraqi government agency in a senior administrative \nposition. Applicant\u2019s mother receives a government pension. He loves his mother and \ncontacts her weekly or biweekly depending upon his schedule. (Tr. 28-30, 63, 72-73; \nResponse to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq.  He retired from the \nIraqi Army as a senior enlisted person. He receives a government pension. Applicant  \ncontacts him about once or twice a month. (Tr. 32, 63-64, 81-82; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He is employed \nas an engineer with an Iraqi government agency. Applicant contacts his brother about 3-\n4 times a year. (Tr. 33-35, 70; Response to SOR)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  Applicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens of and reside in Iraq. One is a \ndentist who works for an Iraqi government agency. The other sister is a computer \nengineer for an Iraqi government agency. Applicant talks to his sisters about 3-4 times a \nyear. (Tr. 35-36, 71-72; Response to SOR)  \n \nThe last time Applicant visited with his family members who are citizens of and \nreside in Iraq was in December 2018. His mother was in the hospital. They believed she \nwas on her death bed. Applicant stayed for three or four days. His mother recovered \nfrom her illness. Prior to that time, he had not visited with his mother in person for seven \nyears. All of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq hope to immigrate to the United States. \nThey have applied for refugee status and are awaiting their second interview with U.S. \nCustoms and Immigration. (Tr. 30, 74; Response to SOR)  \n \nApplicant provided information about his family members each time he \ncompleted a counter-intelligence update when he was employed with DOD contractors \nwhile he was a citizen of Iraq, and while on active duty in the U.S. Army. (Gov 3; Gov 4; \nResponse to SOR) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nUnder the Financial Considerations concern, it is alleged that Applicant owes an \nauto dealership approximately $30,121 related to a voluntary automobile repossession. \nApplicant purchased a car in State A (where he was undergoing military training) before \nbeing assigned to another duty station in State B.  After Applicant moved to State B, the \nautomobile dealer attempted to modify the terms of the purchase contract on two \noccasions. Each time, the dealer increased the cost of the purchase price. Applicant \nconsulted a legal assistance attorney, who advised him the automobile dealer breached \nthe contract. Applicant hired a civilian attorney who concurred and advised Applicant to \nship the car back to the dealer.  Applicant had only had the car for a few weeks and he \npaid to have the car shipped back to the dealer in State A. His private attorney wrote a \nletter to the dealer outlining the situation and alleging fraud on their part.  The debt is no \nlonger on Applicant\u2019s credit report.  Applicant has no other delinquent debts and has an \nexcellent credit rating. (SOR \u00b6 2.a: Tr. 36-39; 75-76; Gov 5 at 6; AE A; AE K; AE L; \nResponse to SOR)   \n\n5 \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Personal Conduct, it is alleged that Applicant received nonjudicial \npunishment around February 2017, for violations of Articles 91 and 134 of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. Applicant was deployed to Turkey at the time he received \nnonjudicial punishment. He had filed a formal complaint against several members of his \nsquadron on January 8, 2017 and February 2017, because he felt he was being \nharassed and that his unit was a hostile work environment. (AE P) On 18 January 2017, \nApplicant was placed on a medical profile for injuries to his left shoulder. The profile \nincluded no running, no pushups, and no sit-ups for 90 days. The profile also ordered \nApplicant not lift his left arm and to engage in minimal movement with his left arm. \nApplicant complained to the medical staff that he was being harassed by members of \nhis unit.  (Tr. 39-42; 76-78; AE P; AE Q; Response to SOR)   \n \nApplicant testified he received nonjudicial punishment because he failed to follow  \norders to stand at parade rest.  He could not do so because of his shoulder. Applicant \nclaims his fellow soldiers set him up in order to diminish his credibility. Applicant \nprovided a copy of the complaints he made about the conduct of several members in his \nunit and a copy of his medical profile. He did not have a copy of the Article 15 and the \nArticle 15 was not in the case file. He disclosed the Article 15 on his most recent \nsecurity clearance application in July 2017. This is the only time Applicant has been \npunished under Article 15. Applicant believed the Article 15 was unfair. Discouraged by \nthe treatment he received, Applicant opted to be medically discharged. He received an \nhonorable discharge. (Tr. 39-42, 76-78; Gov 1 at 30-31; AE O; AE P; AE Q; Response \nto SOR) \n \n \nApplicant applied to become a contract linguist after his discharge from the U.S. \nArmy. He has had no issues in his current position. (Tr. 44)  \n \nWhole-person Factors  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s was counseled on his duty performance in June 2016 and in June \n2017. Both were favorable. In his 2016 counseling he was praised for helping other \nteammates while on temporary duty in Jordan. His supervisor wrote \u201cYou are a good \nsoldier in my squad when it comes to any task you are willing to take it.\u201d In June 2017, \nApplicant was told he was a valuable member of the team during an annual exercise in \nJordan. Specifically:  \n \nAs a member of the exercise, you have shown great attitude towards work \nand have delivered all your assignments on time. I am encouraging you to \nkeep the same professional manner. You also showed respect towards \nyour superiors and subordinates from both, the U.S. and Jordanian side. \nYou have performed your responsibilities in a professional manner and \nhave showed the best of you. (AE N) \n \n \nStaff Sergeant R. worked with Applicant from late 2018 to early 2019, in Jordan. \nApplicant was a civilian contract linguist. Sergeant R. states that Applicant is a \nphenomenal linguist and has been asset to his organization. His prior military \n\n6 \n \nexperience was helpful. Applicant\u2019s skill at interpretation quickly made him a preferred \nlinguist to facilitate training and professional relations between U.S. and Jordanian \narmed forces instructors. He describes Applicant as \u201cintelligent, loyal and excellent at \nhis profession.\u201d (AE D at 1) \n \n \nCaptain M. personally attests to Applicant\u2019s intelligence, fortitude, and \nprofessionalism. Applicant has exceptional qualities as a leader and interpreter.  He \nstates:  \n \n \n \nApplicant has received several certificates of appreciation related to his duties as \na linguist in deployed locations. (AE E) He provided several photographs which reflect \nhis service as a linguist in support of the U.S. military. (AE E)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n7 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n   \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern under Foreign Influence:   \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign  country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n\n8 \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b) apply. The mere possession of \nclose family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant\u2019s parents, two sisters and \none brother are citizens of and reside in Iraq. This creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Iraq\u2019s serious \nhuman rights problems, and its issues with terrorism. The government of Iraq has made \nsome progress, but a heightened risk remains. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq also create a \npotential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified information and \nhis desire to help his family members by providing that information. The risk is also \nheightened because Applicant\u2019s parents are retired from the Iraqi government and \nreceive pensions from the Iraqi government. His three siblings who reside in Iraq \ncurrently work for the Iraqi government.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nmitigating condition applies: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \n \nAt great risk to himself, Applicant worked for the U.S. government in Iraq from \n2007 to 2008 and in 2011 while he was an Iraqi citizen.  His efforts resulted in the U.S. \ngovernment granting Applicant a SIV. Applicant immigrated to the United States in \nOctober 2011 and settled in the United States. He worked several jobs and then \n\n9 \n \nenlisted in the U.S. Army in 2015. He became a U.S. citizen in May 2016. After his Army \nservice, Applicant became a contractor supporting the U.S. government as a linguist in \noverseas locations. While previously working as contract linguist in Iraq, he worked \nalongside U.S. forces under combat conditions. In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. \nBd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s longstanding commitment to the United States as well as \nhis favorable contributions to national security. He worked under dangerous conditions \nas a linguist for the U.S. government. His efforts resulted in him being granted \npermanent residency in the United States. He enlisted in the U.S. Army for over two \nyears. He was medically discharged with an honorable discharge. The status of his \nfamily members in Iraq remained the same in his previous positions. Applicant \ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy. Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. The security \nconcerns under Foreign Influence are mitigated.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n10 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying condition that is relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report listed a $30,000 debt related to a voluntary automobile \nrepossession.  AG \u00b6 19(a) applies.  \n  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n11 \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThis debt was the result of an automobile dealership attempting to illegally \nchange the terms of Applicant\u2019s automobile contract on two occasions. Applicant \nconsulted a legal assistance attorney, hired a private civilian attorney to represent him \nwhen he returned the car based on breach of contract.  Aside from this debt, Applicant \nhas no other delinquent debts. This was a circumstance which is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was a victim of predatory lending practices.  He took reasonable steps to \nresolve this issue.  The concern raised under financial considerations is mitigated.  \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation, This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (3) a \npattern of dishonesty to rule violations.  \n \n \nBy his own admission, Applicant received Article 15 nonjudicial punishment in \nMarch 2017.  AG \u00b6 16(d) applies related to rule violations. I find Applicant is truthful so \nthere is no issue with a pattern of dishonesty.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating condition applies in Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nonjudicial punishment was a departure from otherwise honorable \nmilitary service. It is clear based on the Applicant\u2019s testimony, the complaints he \nprovided, and his medical records during the time he received the Article 15 that \nApplicant felt he was being harassed by members of his unit. He opted to be medically \ndischarged and received an honorable discharge characterization. Applicant has had no \nissues in his current job while serving as a contract linguist in an overseas location. The \nletters from SSgt R. and Capt M. attest to his outstanding work ethic and dedication to \nhis job. The circumstances that led to his Article 15 are minor and they are unlikely to \nrecur. The Personal Conduct concern is mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s gratitude to \nthe U.S. government for accepting him as a refugee and granting him U.S. citizenship. I \nconsidered his support of the U.S. government overseas both before and after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. I considered Applicant\u2019s years of service as a contract linguist \nin Iraq both before and after immigrating to the U.S. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. He had one minor incident involving Article 15 nonjudicial punishment. The \nevents that led to his punishment are questionable and unfortunate. Applicant has since \nmoved on and continues to be a dedicated and successful contract linguist in support of \nU.S. Forces overseas.            \n \nI considered the reference letters and awards indicating the valuable service  \nApplicant provided as a linguist for the U.S. government working on sensitive projects. \nHis lengthy and dedicated history as a linguist in support of the U.S. military outweigh \nforeign influence concerns because his parents, brother and two sisters are citizens of \nand reside in Iraq.    \n \n \n\n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the U.S. to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I was assigned \nthe case on September 12, 2018.  \nA hearing originally scheduled for December 4, 2018, was cancelled to give \nApplicant more time to retain counsel. A November 29, 2018, notice setting the hearing \nfor January 16, 2019, was subsequently issued.

With no objections, all\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/08/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nexhibits were accepted into the record.

A request for an additional two weeks to submit materials \nresulted in no further submissions. The record was closed on February 22, 2019. In the \ninterim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on January 25, 2019. Based on the testimony, \nmaterials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old divorc\u00e9e with no children. She was married from 2008 \nuntil 2015. Having earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, completed some graduate study, and \nmastered three languages, she is presently an operations specialist. Successful at \nwork, she was recently given a pay raise, increasing her annual salary to $59,000. \nApplicant has received credit counseling. \n \n \nDuring her marriage, both Applicant and her husband worked. She does not \nrecall his salary, but remembers their joint income supported their household, with her \nsalary paying for the lion\u2019s share. (Tr. 19) Applicant found herself in an unhappy marital \nsituation. Her 2015 divorce left her with marital bills that were deemed her responsibility \nand which she could not pay. (Tr. 18) They subsequently became delinquent despite \nher efforts. Her salary as a single teacher earning a gross income of about $32,000 \ncould not cover both the delinquent bills and her current expenses, including rent, food, \nauto, and other day-to-day costs.  \n \n \nAt issue in the SOR are the following delinquent debts: \n \n \n1.a & 1.b \u2013 Student loan ($10,112) and Student loan ($5,993) \u2013 These two loans \nwere combined in the debt rehabilitation process. (Tr. 31) During 2018, a payment of \n$78 was processed toward these debts. Processing for future payments on the plan \nwas delayed because the lender needed tax return information from Applicant. Ex. W \nreflects a payment of $271 on the debts in January 2019. Ex. A is a statement showing \na payment will be processed in the future. Ex. B is a schedule of payments to be made \nin the future. A second payment (pending) is reflected from February 2019 at Ex. Y. \n \n \n1.c \u2013 Past due account with balance of $427 \u2013 Paid. (Ex. C; Tr. 23, 31-32) \n \n \n1.d \u2013 Charged off account ($666) \u2013 Account satisfied and current. (Exs.

(Tr. 34)  \n \n \nApplicant is currently able to pay her day-to-day living expenses and make \nneeded payments to her remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 25) She now has a savings \naccount. Combined, her checking and savings accounts have a current balance of over \n$5,500. (Tr. 26) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back to her unhappy \n2008-2015 marriage, when Applicant\u2019s modest teacher\u2019s salary represented the larger \nshare of the couple\u2019s household income. The rest appear to have arisen after the \ndivorce left her encumbered with sole responsibility for the marital debts based only on \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nher unsupplemented income. To meet the challenges posed by insufficient income, she \ntried to manage the debts, but was unsuccessful. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling and made some headway in \nresolving her delinquent debts. Applicant provided persuasive documentation indicating \nthe delinquent debts noted in the SOR at allegations 1.c-h and 1.j, amounting to \napproximately $2,584, have been addressed. Although equal documentation was \nlacking with regard to the student loan noted at 1.i for $3,013, and the student loans at \n1.a and 1.b, these efforts are  sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(c) in very general terms.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old divorc\u00e9e with a bachelor\u2019s degree and who speaks \nthree languages. She was married from 2008 until 2015, during which time she was the \nprimary earner, generating a teacher\u2019s salary in the mid-$30,000s. She was given \nresponsibility of the marital debts, which were beyond her means without some form of \nmonetary supplementation. She is now a successful operations specialist whose salary \nwas recently raised to about $59,000 a year. \n \nIt is unclear exactly when Applicant first found herself financially able to address \nher delinquent debts. The record seems to indicate her first efforts were made in 2018, \nwith a nominal payment on her student loans before a student loan repayment plan was \ndevised. Applicant has received financial counseling and made more notable headway \nin resolving her other delinquent debts. Applicant provided persuasive documentation \nindicating the modest delinquent debts noted in the SOR at allegations 1.c-h and 1.j, \namounting to approximately $2,584, have been addressed.  \n \nEqual documentation, however, is lacking with regard to the far more significant \ndebts at issue \u2013 specifically, the student loan noted at 1.i for $3,013, and the student \nloans at 1.a and 1.b. Together, these represent over $19,100 in delinquent debt. \nApplicant was unable to submit documentation indicating that the debt at 1.i was made \npart of the larger student loans. Moreover, those larger student loans only reflect \npayments amounting to less than $600, mostly made around the time of the hearing. A \nstronger record of regular and consistent payment is needed to demonstrate a \nmeaningful record of debt repayment. In light of the above, I find that at this time, \nApplicant\u2019s efforts and documentation fail to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n           Subparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                      Subparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

She is \nmarried with an adult child, a minor child, and an adult stepchild.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which include tax returns that were \nnot filed on time, unpaid taxes, delinquent debts, and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. She \nattributes her financial problems primarily to her unemployment in 2008 and 2009, and \nher minor child\u2019s significant and persistent medical problems. Her child had multiple \nsurgeries and procedures and requires recurring medical care. Even with insurance, \nApplicant\u2019s and her husband\u2019s annual out-of-pocket expenses for their child\u2019s medical \ncare has been greater than $10,000.2 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2012. Under \nSchedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $300,651 in secured \nclaims, which included a mortgage loan and two vehicle loans. Under Schedule E, \nCreditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $4,055 in federal income \ntaxes owed by Applicant\u2019s husband to the IRS for the 2004, 2007, and 2010 tax years. \nThe petition listed debts totaling $83,864 under Schedule F, Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Nonpriority Claims. Applicant and her husband realized that it would be \ndifficult to maintain payments with her husband\u2019s sporadic income, and they converted \nthe case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their dischargeable debts were discharged in \n2012.3 \n \n \nApplicant incurred additional financial problems after the bankruptcy discharge. \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $6,976. Six of the debts totaling \n$1,724 are medical debts. Applicant admitted owing all of the delinquent debts except \nfor the $253 credit card debt alleged in SOR 1.k, which she asserted has been paid. \nApplicant stated that she paid a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. She submitted \ncredit reports that show that some of the delinquent debts are no longer reported. She \nstated that she has been paying the smallest debts first, and then moving on to the \nlargest debts.4 Her assertions about the delinquent debts are accepted. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant did not file her state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2016; that she owes the IRS $5,941 for tax year 2013 \nand $1,313 for 2015; and that she owes her state $1,795 for tax year 2013 and $1,913 \nfor 2015. Applicant admitted all of the tax allegations. She stated that she usually \nprepared her and her husband\u2019s tax returns, and she panicked when she was preparing \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 31, 56; GE 1; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5. \n \n4 Tr. at 17, 44-50, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B, C. \n\n \n3 \n \ntheir 2014 returns because they owed so much. She stated that \u201cthen life took over and \n[she] forgot about the taxes.\u201d5 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband retained a tax professional to prepare their income \ntax returns. Their 2016 state and federal income tax returns were filed in November \n2018. The returns indicated their adjusted gross income was $138,018, and they owed \nthe IRS $4,538 and the state $1,059. Those amounts do not include interest and \npenalties. They did not pay the IRS and the state when the tax returns were filed. She \nstated that the tax professional is working on the 2014 federal and state income tax \nreturns, but they have not yet been filed.6 \n \n \nIRS tax transcripts show that as of March 2018, Applicant and her husband owed \nthe IRS $5,941, which includes interest and penalties, for tax year 2013. As of \nDecember 2018, they owed the IRS $4,320 for tax year 2015. They were due a $378 \nfederal refund for tax year 2017, but that amount was withheld and applied to their tax \nliability for tax year 2010. Applicant testified that the taxes owed to the state for 2013 \nand 2015 were paid through a refund from tax year 2017, but she did not submit any \nsupporting documentation.7 \n \n \nApplicant stated that once all the tax returns are filed, she and her husband will \nenter a payment plan with the IRS to pay their back taxes. She also plans to pay her \nstate taxes. Her current job pays well, and she has the financial ability to pay her taxes \nand other debts. She received financial counseling as a requirement of her bankruptcy.8 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 17, 27, 33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5. \n \n6 Tr. at 18-20, 40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE D-H. The SOR did not allege that Applicant \nowed taxes for tax year 2016. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in \nthe application of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis. \n \n7 Tr. at 33-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE F. \n \n8 Tr. at 21, 26-28, 32, 38, 45, 53, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n5 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a bankruptcy case, unpaid \ntaxes, unfiled income tax returns, and delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems primarily to her unemployment in 2008 \nand 2009, and her minor child\u2019s significant and persistent medical problems. Bankruptcy \nwas a legitimate means to address the overwhelming financial problems that resulted \nfrom those conditions. She has been paying the non-tax debts, and I believe she will \ncontinue to address those debts. The bankruptcy and non-tax debts are mitigated. \nHowever, she still has not filed her 2014 federal and state income tax returns, and she \nowes the IRS more than $14,000 and her state at least $1,000.  \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018).  \n \n \nApplicant stated that she intends to file her tax returns and pay her taxes. \nIntentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the allegations that Applicant did not file \nher 2016 state and federal income tax returns. That mitigating condition is given less \nweight because of the timing of when the returns were filed and because she did not \npay the taxes owed for 2016 when she filed the returns. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns \nand unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.v: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted.   \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guidelines D, sexual behavior, E, personal conduct, and J, criminal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nOn April 26, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018. \nOn November 9, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \n02/25/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for November 28, 2018. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. I received five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5) and five Applicant exhibits \n(AE A - AE E). I also incorporated a copy of the discovery letter that Department Counsel \nmailed to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I).

In 2015, however, he again went to a massage parlor, where he paid his \nmasseuse for various sexual activities. When he engaged in this activity, he possessed a \nsecurity clearance, which had been granted in 2014, and a re-investigation for a higher-\nlevel clearance was pending. (Tr. 25) \n \n \nDuring a polygraph, pretest interview in September 2015, Applicant disclosed his \nsexual misconduct.

(AE A) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n4 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of paying for sexual services from prostitutes, masseuses, and \nstrippers triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, \nwhether or not the individual has been prosecuted; and 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes \nan individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d Applicant enrolled in SA \nto address his issues, and he has been attending once a week for the past year. His wife is \naware of his sexual misconduct. They have addressed the strain it caused in their \nrelationship through meditation. Moreover, they have recently enrolled in marital \ncounseling. Applicant testified that he has internalized the lessons learned from SA and \nunderstands how to manage his lust. In conjunction with his wife\u2019s testimony that this crisis \nhas ultimately strengthened their marriage, I conclude Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible. \nAG \u00b6 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 14d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and consistent \ncompliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a favorable prognosis from a \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n5 \n \nqualified mental health professional indicating the behavior is readily controllable with \ntreatment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the sexual behavior security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e), \n\u201cpersonal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by \na foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent episode of sexual misconduct occurred nearly four years \nago, he told his wife about it, and he enrolled in SA counseling. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other \npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, [and] by its very nature . . . calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s \nsexual misconduct was illegal. Consequently, AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence . . . of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted,\u201d applies. In addition to the passage of time and the engagement in counseling, \nas discussed in the previous sections, Applicant has a good employment record. The \ncriminal conduct is mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened . . .,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nBy soliciting prostitutes and seeking sexual services from brothels masquerading as \nmassage parlors, Applicant immersed himself into a criminal underworld of illegal activity. \nAs such, these are serious transgressions. Moreover, although Applicant stopped this \nbehavior after getting married in 2005, it recurred ten years later. Conversely, Applicant has \nnow addressed the problem, confessing to his wife and enrolling in counseling. Given the \nlength of time since the recurrence and the length of time he has been attending \ncounseling, I am persuaded that the possibility of recurrence is minimal. In sum, I conclude \nthat the length of time since the last episode of misconduct, the minimal vulnerability to \n\n6 \n \ncoercion, and the robust presence of rehabilitation outweighs the nature and seriousness \nof the conduct. Applicant has mitigated the security concern.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Her history of indebtedness and financial irresponsibility has not \nbeen mitigated. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented effective June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 3, 2018, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \n  12/11/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 21, 2018. Applicant \nreceived it on August 28, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 \nthrough 11. The FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt \nof the FORM. Applicant submitted a one-page response to the FORM (Response). Items \n1 through 7 and the Response are admitted into the record without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on December 3, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.h, and 1.i with explanations. She \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact, in chronological order. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. She is married \nand has three minor children. (Answer.) She has been employed in her position with a \ngovernment contractor since June 2015, although the contract holder changed in March \n2017.  She was unemployed from August 2012 to May 2015. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She \nattributed her financial problems at that time to an unstated period of separation from her \nhusband. In 2009 her husband was discharged from the Army and diagnosed with \nmultiple sclerosis. They separated and Applicant was left to support her daughter. She \ncould not afford to pay all of her bills on her salary. As a result, she consulted an attorney, \nwho recommended she file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She discharged $155,518 in claims \nthrough that bankruptcy in February 2010. She has since reconciled with her husband. \n(Answer; Item 6.) \n \nApplicant owed Federal income taxes for tax years 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014, \nin the amounts of $732; $7,279; $4,560; and $3,843, respectively, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d through 1.g. Those amounts are reflected on March 2018 account transcripts from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). As of April 2018, Applicant owed $0 for 2010, 2012, and \n2013 after balances of $546 for 2010; $5,937 for 2012; and $4,047 for 2013 were \u201cwritten \noff\u201d by the IRS.  She has established multiple installment agreements with the IRS in the \npast, but has no history of regular payments under those agreements. (Answer; Reply; \nItem 3; Item 5.) \n \nAdditionally, Applicant failed to file her Federal and state tax returns in a timely \nmanner in 2011, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. They were filed late, in October 2012. She \nblamed the late filing on having a baby in March 2012 and moving to another state in July \n2012. Her 2011 IRS account transcript reflected she had a zero account balance for 2011. \n(Answer; Reply; Item 3; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant was employed by a U.S. government agency from July 2011 to July \n2012. In March 2012, she was confronted by her supervisor and accused of using her \ngovernment credit card for personal use (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant admitted she used her \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngovernment credit card to take out three \u201ccash advance[s] for gas money and to help \nsupplement for food and bills.\u201d She set up a repayment plan with her employer, but failed \nto complete the repayment plan when she terminated her employment in August 2012. \nThe debt was eventually discharged in her 2017 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, discussed below. \nShe received an IRS 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, from this creditor.  (Answer; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted to her state taxation authority for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $2,218 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In February 2018, she set up a payment agreement to \nresolve this debt through 23 monthly payments of $145. She failed to produce \ndocumentation of payments under that agreement. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Item \n5.) \n \n \nIn October 2017 Applicant filed her second petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). She discharged $115,187 in debt on January 10, 2018. (Item 4; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling from a financial readiness center. \nDocumentation from financial counseling suggests Applicant and her husband have a \nmonthly surplus of $1,094, after their monthly expenses are paid. The financial counselor \nadvised them to pay off small debts first and begin to pay back student loans, which are \ncurrently in deferred status. The financial counselor recommended Applicant\u2019s husband \nquit smoking. They were advised to eliminate unnecessary services and subscriptions to \nsave money. It is unclear from the record if Applicant implemented any of these \nsuggestions, although she indicated she was working to improve her finances and resolve \nher debts. (Answer; Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant discharged $155,518 of delinquent debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin 2010. She then incurred another $115,187 in debt, which she discharged in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2018. She has a history of not meeting her financial obligations and \nspending beyond her means. She misused her government credit card on three \noccasions in 2012, which was an intentional breach of the government\u2019s trust. There is \nsufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(d), and 19(e). \n \n \nApplicant failed to file Federal and state taxes in a timely manner in 2011. She \nfailed to pay her Federal income taxes for 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. She also incurred \nan unresolved state tax liability. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nAG \u00b6 19(f). \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant discharged a significant amount of delinquent debt through two Chapter \n7 bankruptcies, just eight years apart. Her financial circumstances remain largely \nunchanged, and there is no evidence that she will be able to avoid delinquent accounts \nin the future. She remains indebted for Federal and state taxes. Her debt is ongoing. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed the financial problems to her separation from her husband, his \nmedical problems, and her unemployment. Those are circumstances beyond her control. \nHowever, those circumstances do not mitigate her poor judgment in using her \ngovernment credit card for personal purchases. Further, the record lacks documentation \nto show she reasonably and responsibly addressed her delinquencies. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation of financial counseling. However, there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that she is making a good-faith effort to repay her \ncreditors or that she has taken the advice of the credit counselor. There is minimal \nevidence to conclude that her financial problems are under control. The evidence does \nnot establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence of a reasonable basis to dispute any of her \nalleged delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant filed her state and Federal income tax return for 2011. She has been \nrelieved of liability for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013, after the IRS wrote off those debts. \nApplicant provided no evidence of arrangements to resolve her Federal tax debt for 2014. \nShe provided no documentation of payments to the state taxation authority under her \nagreement. Documentation of compliance with those arrangements is necessary. AG \u00b6 \n20(g) does not mitigate the Government\u2019s concern. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has recently \ndischarged delinquent debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has the opportunity to \nrebuild her credit. While Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence about her overall \nfinancial stability to conclude further tax problems or financial delinquencies are unlikely, \nshe will be  on a path to financial stability if she follows the advice of the financial \ncounselor, resolves her tax debts, and addresses her student loans. She may be eligible \nfor national security eligibility in the future if she is able to document reasonable and \nresponsible actions to maintain solvency. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H. Applicant \ntimely answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) \non November 30, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on December 4, 2018, and had 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a two-page \nresponse (Response) to the FORM that incorporated by reference his previous Answers \nto the SOR dated April 30, 2018, and May 4, 2018 (and attachments). Applicant included \na statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse subject \nto revocation of his national security eligibility. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified as \nItems 1 through 4, is admitted without objection. Department Counsel requested that I \n03/18/2019\n\n2 \n \ntake administrative notice of the following: D.C. Code \u00a7 48-904.01 (amended in 2015); \nThe Facts on Marijuana Laws, from the Metropolitan Police Department website; and a \nMemorandum dated October 25, 2014, entitled Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, from the Director of National Intelligence. I have taken administrative \nnotice of these documents collectively marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The case was \nassigned to me on March 1, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and obtained his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He obtained a master\u2019s degree in 2008. He has been \nemployed as an architect for a federal contractor since 2004. He was promoted to \nprincipal and partner in an architectural firm engaged as a federal contractor in 2018. \nApplicant reports no military service, and he has never married. Applicant previously held \na security clearance since 2007, without incident.   \n \nOn May 12, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), \nand in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded \u201cyes\u201d to questions \nabout illegal drug use and/or misuse of prescription drugs within the last seven years. He \nestimated his first use of marijuana was in January 2002, and he used marijuana (MJ) \n\u201conce or twice a year, for fun, with friends.\u201d2 He also stated that he used MJ while he \npossessed a security clearance and he did not intend to use any controlled substances \nin the future. In an earlier SCA signed by Applicant on December 21, 2006, he responded \n\u201cyes\u201d to similar questions about any illegal use of drugs or controlled substance in section \n24 (Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity).3 He indicated that he used MJ about 10-15 \ntimes between September 1999 and February 2002. He was granted a security clearance \nin 2007.  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR in April 2018, Applicant stated that his most recent use \nof MJ in 2017, was due to a misinterpretation of the change in the law effectively legalizing \nMJ in Washington, D.C. He used the drug only recreationally at social settings where it \nwas provided by friends and he never cultivated, sold, or purchased MJ. Since the District \nis a federalized city, he wrongly assumed that the legalization of MJ applied across the \nfederal government. Although, he self-reported his use of MJ occurring between \nSeptember 1999 and May 2017, Applicant stated that there was a long lapse of several \nyears before he re-offended in 2017. He does not know which years he used MJ, or the \nexact number of usages. He provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement or substance misuse subject to revocation of his national security eligibility.  \n \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 12, 2017 Security \nClearance Application (SCA) (Item 3) and his SCA dated December 21, 2006 (item 4).  \n \n2 Item 3, p. 35. \n \n3 Item 4, p. 29. \n\n3 \n \nApplicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and \nhe did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ. Applicant \nalso attached his resume, detailing his significant experience and accomplishments in his \nprofession, several letters of appreciation, and two performance appraisals showing that \nhe was rated excellent or outstanding in all categories. He has experience working on \nhigh visibility, secure, projects. He received year-end bonuses each year from 2014 \u2013 \n2017. He also provided four positive character reference letters at Tab E attached to his \nAnswer to the SOR, including one from his facility security officer (FSO). All attest to \nApplicant\u2019s integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability.  \n \n \n                                           Policies \n \n \nDOD took action in this case under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n          The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG  \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n          The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant used MJ on sporadic social occasions between 1999 and May 2017, \nincluding after he submitted an SCA in December 2006 and received a clearance. The \ngovernment provided sufficient evidence to establish that the disqualifying conditions \nabove are applicable, and the burden shifts to Applicant to show mitigation.  \n \n\n5 \n \n \n           AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n           (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n           (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n     (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n                                                   \n \n             Applicant continued his sporadic use of MJ until his last use in May 2017, almost \ntwo years ago. He did not use continuously during the period from 1999-2017. He self-\nreported and he provided evidence that he has disassociated from friends who use illegal \ndrugs, and a letter of intent to abstain in the future. He misinterpreted the byzantine \nchange in the law in Washington, D.C., with respect to legalizing the use of MJ. He is not \nan attorney and there is considerable confusion surrounding the patchwork of state laws \naround the nation, legalizing MJ. Applicant\u2019s use of MJ has been mitigated by the passage \nof time. He self-disclosed his MJ use in his 2006 SCA, and was granted a clearance \nnonetheless. It is unclear whether this was perceived as acquiescence to his recreational \ndrug use, or whether Applicant understood that his MJ use conflicted with federal law, \nafter completing that SCA. I perceive his voluntary disclosure as candor and cooperation. \nThe government would never know about his MJ use but for his own disclosures. In any \nevent, he now knows, and he has taken appropriate actions to overcome this \ndisqualification. His conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply and his self-reported drug use is mitigated.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n6 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Most importantly, Applicant was candid and cooperative. \nHe resolved the specific violations alleged in the SOR, and he has unequivocally declared \nhis intention to refrain from further use of illegal drugs.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement no longer remains a security concern. These self-\nreported offenses were committed under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has \nacknowledged the egregiousness of his drug involvement and taken steps to insure that \nsuch behavior does not recur. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:               For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility \nis granted.  \nStatement of Case \nOn March 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The action was \ntaken under DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. However, on August 15, 2018, he withdrew that request and \nasked for a decision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 30, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant \n12/21/2018\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5. He was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nSeptember 17, 2018.

Applicant expressed no objections in AE A to Items 1 \nthrough 5, which are admitted into evidence as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \nDepartment Counsel had no objections to AE A and it is admitted. The case was \nassigned to me on December 17, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a government contractor.

He tried mushrooms twice with friends between May 2015 and August 2015. He \nwas arrested in September 2014 and charged with possession of marijuana and defiant \ntrespass. He pled guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct. He was fined $300 \nfor this offense. (Answer; GE 3; GE 4.) \n \n \nApplicant was hired by the government contractor for whom he previously \nworked in May 2017. He completed a new security clearance application on June 28, \n2017. He voluntarily disclosed all of his drug use on that security clearance application. \n(GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant now avoids all environments where drugs are used and promised to \ncontinue to do so. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use. \n(Answer.) \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to Drug Involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \n\u00b6 25, and the following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations of the September 2014 arrest for marijuana \nuse, marijuana use from September 2014 to April 2016, and mushroom use from May \n2015 to August 2015. Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(b). AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established as Applicant was not \u201cgranted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d within the plain meaning of those \nterms at the time he used marijuana or mushrooms. \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26, \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation \nfrom \ndrug-using \nassociates \nand \ncontacts;  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use spanned over a two-year period, while in college. \nDuring the past two years, he demonstrated his serious commitment to abstinence from \nillegal substances. He ceased using all drugs prior to accepting employment with a \ngovernment contractor, his first professional job. He disassociated himself from drug-\nusing friends and associates. Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred largely while he was \nattending educational institutions. He is now in the work-force and no longer attends \nschool. Thus, he has changed his environment. While the Directive does not define \nwhat constitutes \u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), his candor \nabout his illegal drug abuse leads me to accept as credible his assertions of no future \nintent to use marijuana or other illegal substances under any circumstances. Applicant \nhas demonstrated sufficient intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He signed a \nstatement of intent. He has matured and understands that any illegal drug involvement \nis incompatible with his defense contractor employment. Applicant has presented \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was irresponsible \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nand did not recognize the seriousness of his actions when he used marijuana and \nmushrooms in college. He has now matured. He has not used illegal substances for \nmore than two years after coming to the revelation that there was no room for illegal \nsubstances in his future professional life. His changes are permanent and the likelihood \nof recurrence is extremely low. The potential for pressure, coercion, or duress is \neliminated by Applicant\u2019s abstinence. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He \nmet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. National security eligibility is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nHistory of Case\nOn February 28, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4).\n    12/07/2018\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 23, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was scheduled for hearing on July 26, 2018. A hearing was held on the\nscheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits (GE).\nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 14 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 3, 2018. \nBesides its four exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts\ndetailed in 13 official source documents that are official Government publications.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007). Administrative\nnotice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See\nStein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown,\nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named official background\nreports addressing the geopolitical situation in Iraq. \nAdministrative notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing Iraq\u2019s current status. Nor did the notice foreclose consideration of information\nabout the country not covered in the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice, so\nas to ensure accurate and timely assessments of the country\u2019s changing political\nlandscape.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the proceedings, Applicant requested the record be kept open\nto permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with his documented surrender\nof his Iraqi passport. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to\nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant documented his submission of blood-test information to his\nsponsor and prospective employer. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted for general\nbackground purposes without objection as AE M.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to have: (a) one brother who\nis a citizen of Iraq; (b) two brothers who are citizens and residents of Iraq; (c) a sister-in-\nlaw who is a citizen and resident of Iraq; and (d) numerous other relatives who are\ncitizens and residents of Iraq.  \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly began gambling after receiving $80,000 in\ninheritance and lost all of his inheritance. Allegedly, he obtained loans from his siblings\nto continue his gambling and disclosed his gambling activities in the electronic\nquestionnaires for Investigative Processing (e-QIP) he completed in March 2017. \n2\n\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his answers to questions posed\nby a counterintelligence investigator in a February 2017 personal subject interview by\ntelling the investigator he transferred his inheritance money to his siblings for safe-\nkeeping, omitting facts that he had already spent the money on gambling. Allegations of\nincurring gambling losses under Guideline F were incorporated by subparagraph 3.b of\nGuideline E.\n In his response to the SOR allegations covering Guideline B, Applicant partially\nadmitted and partially denied each of the allegations. He claimed his oldest brother is a\ndual-U.S. citizen who currently resides in the United States and maintains no contact\nwith Applicant. He claimed his two other brothers are Iraqi citizens residing in Iraq who\nare currently waiting for authorization to immigrate ot the United States. He also claimed\nthat his sister-in-law is married to his youngest brother residing in Iraq and does not\nspeak to Applicant. And he claimed that he does not speak with any of his extended \nfamily members in Iraq who are employed by the Iraqi government.\nAddressing his alleged delinquent debts, Applicant partially admitted and partially\ndenied allegations pertaining to his gambling. He admitted to receiving an inheritance\nbut denies losing all of his inheritance on gambling and obtaining loans from his siblings\nto finance his gambling. He denied being an abusive gambler and denies engaging in\nany gambling since 2016.\nResponding to Guideline E allegations of (a) falsifying material facts during a\ncounterintelligence-focused security screening by telling an authorized investigator he\ntransferred his inheritance money to his siblings and (b) incorporated allegations of\nusing inheritance money to gamble, Applicant admitted and denied the allegations,\nclaiming he did not lose all of his inheritance money on gambling and was not an\nabusive gambler. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq in December 1960 and immigrated to the\nUnited States in January 2011 as a refugee. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 57) As an\napproved U.S. refugee, he was issued a green card entitling him to permanent\nresidency status. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 49, 57).  He qualified for U.S. refugee\nstatus due to years of his working for the U.S. Army in Iraq (2004-2009) through his\nemployments by U.S. companies supporting the Iraqi government. (GE 2)  \n3\n\nIn April 2016, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen and received a U.S.\npassport in the same month and year. (GE 1 and AEs A and D) He acquired an Iraqi\npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen due to fears that traveling on a U.S. passport in\nIraq would be dangerous. (GE 2) He has since surrendered his Iraqi passport. While\nApplicant still holds Iraqi citizenship, he has expressed a willingness to renounce it. (GE\n4)\nApplicant has never married and has no children. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 80) He earned a\nhigh school diploma in Iraq in June 1981 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Iraq in June\n2003. He reported active duty service in the Iraq military between December 1982 and\nOctober 1990. He maintains no contact with current or former military colleagues. (GE\n1-4) \nApplicant never served in the U.S. military service due to his being well above\nthe age of qualification when he arrived in the United States. (GEs 1-2) Before\nimmigrating to the United States, he served on active duty with the Iraqi Army as a\nclerk. (GE 4) His military service was mandated by the Iraqi Government. (GE 4) He\nreceived an honorable discharge with the rank of corporal in October 1990 and\nrelinquished all ties with the Iraqi Army. Applicant was awarded no benefits or pension\nfor his Army service. (GE 4)\nSince November 2016, Applicant has worked part time with a non-defense transit\ncompany as a driver and makes about $5,000 a month, enough to support himself. (GE\n2 and AE L; Tr. 39) His application for a linguist position with a global linguist firm in\nFebruary 2017 remains on hold pending confirmation of his security clearance. (GEs 1-\n2) \nAfter immigrating to the Unites States, Applicant worked for DoD contractors.\nBetween July 2011 and November 2016, Applicant worked for various non-defense\nretailers in the United States. (GEs 1 and 4 and AE L) He reported brief periods of\nunemployment between May 2012 and November 2016 when his only financial support\ncame from unemployment disability benefits. (GEs 1-2)\nApplicant\u2019s family ties in Iraq\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents passed away in 2005. (GE 4) While alive, his father\nwas a brigadier general (never in the Ba\u2019ath party) in the Iraqi army before his\nretirement in 1968. (Tr. 40) Applicant has two brothers who are citizens and residents of\nIraq and also served in the Iraqi army. (GEs 1-2 and 4; Tr. 40) He maintains bi-weekly \ncontacts with his youngest  brother but never discusses his U.S. Government work out\nof concern for his safety. (Tr. 64-67) Applicant\u2019s younger brother is married, and his wife\n(Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law) is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (GEs 1-2 and 4; Tr. 70-71) \nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s next-to-youngest brother (middle brother) is also a citizen\nand resident of Iraq. (Tr. 69-70) But Applicant has not spoken to this brother since 2008.\n4\n\n(Tr. 62) To the best of his knowledge, neither of his brothers residing in Iraq ever\nworked for the Iraqi government or have any connections with the Iraq government. (Tr.\n65-66)\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States, and\nresides in the United States. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 66-67) His oldest brother was naturalized as\na U.S. citizen in March 2018. (AE I) Applicant does not have a close relationship with\nthis brother and maintains infrequent contact with him, despite their close proximity to\none another. (Tr. 56-58) Besides his siblings and sister-in-law, Applicant has numerous\nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GEs 1-4) Applicant has no contact with\nany of these relatives.\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq and neither provides nor receives\nfinancial support from any family member residing in Iraq. (GE 2) Applicant assured that\nboth of his brothers who reside in Iraq live in generally safe and secure areas in the\nBaghdad region; although they are not completely insulated from risk of harm from\ncorrupt Shiite officials who look to Iran for advice. (Tr. 73-74) But because he has never\ndisclosed what he does for the U.S. Government, Applicant cannot foresee either of his\nfamily members in Iraq being exposed to risks of pressure or coercion. (Tr. 62) \nIn a signed, sworn statement of intent he provided, Applicant pledged (1) to\nnever obtain a foreign passport or foreign citizenship with a country other than the\nUnited States again and (2) to continue to have minimal or no contact with foreign\ncontacts outside of his official duties. (AE E) Applicant consented to an automatic\nrevocation of his security clearance should he violate any pledge in his statement of\nintent. (AE E)\nIraq\u2019s country status\nIraq is a country with a population of 27 million that is broken down along ethnic\nand religious lines: Shiites, Sunni, Kurds and Turkoman comprise the predominant\nethnic and sectarian groups.   Once known as Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent), Iraq is\nbordered by Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. See Background\nNote, Iraq, at 2-3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008)   At the end of World War I, Iraq\nbecame a British-mandated territory, and founding member of the Arab League. (id.)\nGeneral Abdul Karim Qasim assumed power in a July 1958 coup and held power\nfor five years before succumbing to the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s takeover of the Iraqi government,\nand Hasan al-Bakr\u2019s selection as prime minister.  See Background Note, Iraq, supra, at\n4.  When Bakr resigned in 1979, Saddam  Hussein assumed the reigns of power. Under\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s direction, Iraq launched a major invasion of its neighbor, Iran, in the\n1980s. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. 2018); \nBackground Note Iraq, supra.  Iraq declared victory in 1988 and survived to claim the\nlargest military establishment in the region.  Iraq then turned its forces to mounted\n5\n\nattacks against the ongoing Kurdish rebellion by Kurdish elements in the northern\nmountains of Iraq.   (id.)\nIraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and was repelled by a U.S.-led coalition in\nFebruary 1991. See World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra.  After\nthe war, the UN Security Council required the Hussein regime to surrender to the\ncoalition and submit to UN inspections. When the Ba\u2019ath regime refused to fully comply,\nthe Security Council invoked sanctions to prevent further weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD) development, and to enforce Iraq\u2019s surrender terms.  Coalition forces employed\nlimited no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq and a limited no-drive zone in\nsouthern Iraq to prevent the regime from invading Kuwait again. (id.)\nIn 2003, A U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and succeeded in removing Saddam\nHussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and political power. See The World\nFactbook: Iraq, supra;  Background Note Iraq, supra, at 3.  After two years of operations\nunder a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in March 2006\n(with the approval of the U.S. Government), following free elections. (id.)\nNotwithstanding the election of a new national government with U.S. backing,\nviolence continued to envelop Iraq. This violence was fueled and perpetrated by Al\nQieda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and, Shiite militias and death squads. See The World\nFactbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note Iraq, supra. State Department reports\ndocument human rights abuses that include a \u201cpervasive climate of violence,\nmisappropriation of official authority by sectarian, criminal and insurgent groups;\narbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhumane or\ndegrading treatment or punishment.\u201d (id.)\nSince March 2006, the Government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad\ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs. See The\nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2;  Background Note Iraq, supra. at 8. While elections\nhave been held, none of the key constituent groups have been able to form a\ngovernment, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security throughout the\nprovinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile political environment\nin Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that continue to\nunderscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence.\nEconomic developments\nEconomically, Iraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it\nhas for the past half century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949,\nand to Syria in 1952  See The World Factbook: Iraq, supra;  Background Note Iraq,\nsupra. As a result of the  U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil refining\ncapabilities were shuttered. The rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure\nhas continued to expand since 2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from\ninsurgent activity. \n6\n\nProposed oil revenue sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno-\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds) still awaits passage after years of stalled\nnegotiations, however, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such\nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement for the Record, Worldwide\nThreat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National\nIntelligence (Feb. 2018) For the foreseeable future, the national government can be\nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law\nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector. See id.\nRecent reports (although not official U.S. pronouncements) suggest that\nBaghdad is close to agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government\n(KRG) to restart crude flowing from the Kirkuk oil fields as U.S. sanctions against Iran\nhit Iran\u2019s energy sales. See Iraq closing in on Deal to Resume Kirkuk Oil Exports,\nReuters/Bloomberg (Nov. 2018). If these estimates prove to be accurate, they would be\nwelcomed by both U.S. and allied Interests. For despite Iraq\u2019s producing 4.3 million\nbarrels of oil per day, according to published reports, Iraq\u2019s population remains poor.\nSee Putting Iraq-KRG Oil Relations on Solid Legal Ground, the Washington Institute for\nNear East Policy (July 2018). Currently, the case brought by the federal government of\nIraq against the KRG in 2012 over the legality of the KRG\u2019s oil contracts and\nindependent exports remains pending with no disposition projected in the near future.\nSee id. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to\ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would\nseem to legitimate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal\nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have\nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking\nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government\ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the\nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \nTerrorism and human rights issues\nDespite recent improvements in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a\nvery dangerous, volatile and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department\ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Travel Advisory-\nIraq, U.S. Dept. of State (Jan. 2018); Request for Administrative Notice, supra, a 3-4. \nThe State Department assessed Baghdad as being a critical-threat location for crime\ndirected at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Iraq 2017 Crime and Safety Report:\nBaghdad at 2-3. U.S. Dept. of State (March 2017) While crime statistics and crime\nreporting mechanisms are incomplete and inconsistent, the vast majority of\nindividualsunder contract with, or employed by, the U.S. Government in Iraq are\nrequired to travel with a protective security detail, so as to limit potential criminal threats\nagainst them. (id.)  \n7\n\nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include\nsites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants, police\nstations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations, and\nother locations with expatriate personnel.

See R. Alaaldin, What Iraq\u2019s election Results Mean for U.S.\nPolicy at 1-6. Brookings at https://brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos (May 2018).\nThis parliamentary election marks the first such federal election since the defeat of ISIS\nin December 2017 and was historic in many respects with over 7,000 candidates vying\nfor 329 seats. See The World Factbook: Iraq, supra and  R. Alaaldin, What Iraq\u2019s\nElection Results Mean for U.S. Policy, supra.\nDespite heavy media coverage and high hopes surrounding election prospects\nfor the prime minister, al-Abadi failed to alleviate religious tension and develop a\nnational consensus in Iraq on the importance of secular governance (only 44.5 per cent,\nthe lowest turnout since 2003), Iraq\u2019s elections did, however, herald a new chapter for\nthe victorious Sadrist movement headed by Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his millions\nof underclass followers. See https://brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos, supra. \nAccording to Brookings reports, the Winner of the May 2018 election was al-Sadr\u2019s al-\nSa\u2019iroohn coalition with 54 seats, followed by the Fatah bloc, headed by Hadi al-Amiri\nwho has reported close ties with Iran, with 47 seats, and the Nasr coalition, headed by\nal-Abadi with 42 seats. (id.) Election results were confirmed by Iraq\u2019s top election body\nin June 2018 following a country-wide manual count, clearing the path for political\nparties to form a government. See  https://www.wsj.com (Aug. 9, 2018) \nWhile prospects for forming a government between the three principal coalitions\nare still uncertain, reported public statements about creating an alliance between al-\nSadr\u2019s and al-Bati\u2019s respective coalitions offer promise for Iraq in the wake of widely\ndiscredited elections. See F. Hassan and R. Nordland, Iraqi Political Alliance Unites a\nU.S. Friend and Foe, https://www.nytimes.com. And although these reports do not\nrepresent official U.S. pronouncements, they are illustrative of the major political\nchanges that are gaining traction in Iraq and bear watching.\nFor Applicant, a Sunni by birth, prospects for uniting the various sectarian groups\nunder a united umbrella headed by al-Sadr are not very promising. In Applicant\u2019s\nestimation, the formation of a new government comprised of the three principal Shiite\ncoalitions is likely to further marginalize Sunnis as a political force among Iraq\u2019s\n9\n\ngoverning elites. (Tr. 74) Applicant posited that the cleric al-Sadr and all of the Shiite\nparties in Iraq will continue to be influenced by Iran. (Tr. 74)\nCurrent U.S. Relations with Iraq\nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership\nwith Iraq and the Iraqi people. See U.S. Relations with Iraq at 1-2, U.S. Dept. of State\n(July 2018). In coordination with the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS, the United States\nassisted Iraq\u2019s efforts to achieve the long-sought goal of liberating all of Iraqi territory\nfrom ISIS. The Strategic framework agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United\nStates provides the basis of the United States\u2019s bilateral relationship with Iraq and\ncovers a wide range of bilateral issues, including political relations and diplomacy,\ndefense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues,\nservices, science, culture, education, and environment. (id.)\nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq is considerable and stresses economic reform,\nassistance to vulnerable groups, and democracy and governance. See U.S. Relations\nwith Iraq, supra. U.S. security assistance supports the development of modern,\naccountable, fiscally sustainable, and professional Iraqi military resources capable of\ndefending Iraq and its borders. The United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary\ndeveloping country under the Generalized System of Preferences program and has\nbeen proactive in the promotion of two-way trade between the United States and Iraq.\n(id, at 2)  Noteworthy, Iraq\u2019s re-integration into the international community has been\nmarked by their demonstrated cooperation with international institutions, including the\nUnited Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the Arab League.  (id.)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBefore immigrating to the United States in 2011, Applicant maintained an Iraqi\nbank account from approximately 1966 through 2009, when he closed the account. (GE\n2) The  account was opened by his father and was later supplemented by inheritance\nfunds from a real estate sale that approximated $80,000. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 37-38)\nCombined with funds from his prior employment with U.S. companies, he amassed\n$105,000 in the account by 2009. (GE 2)  \nIn preparation for his planned travels to Jordan in 2009, Applicant closed his\nbank account and transferred $95,000 of the closed-out bank funds to his sister for\nsafekeeping during his travels, inclusive of the $80,000 of inheritance monies and the\nadditional $15,000 he had earned. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51) Before departing for his Jordan trip,\nhe retrieved the $95,000 he left with his sister and left the remaining $10,000 with his\nmiddle brother for safekeeping. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 37-38) \nWhile traveling in Jordan and Lebanon in 2009-2010, Applicant lost most of these\ninherited funds and continued to gamble with loaned funds from his sister and brother\n10\n\n($4,000 and $1,000, respectively). Applicant never told any of his family members that\nhe used his inherited $80,000 to gamble with, because in Iraq gambling is frowned\nupon. (Tr. 53-54) And telling any of his family members about his gambling he believed\nwould have shamed him with family members and exposed him to potential blackmail.\n(Tr.  53-54) Since ceasing his gambling activities, Applicant no longer fears telling his\nyounger brother about his past gambling and losses. (Tr. 55) \nAfter both of his Iraqi-based brothers applied for visas to come to the United\nStates, Applicant told his sister who lives in the United States not to tell any of his\nbrothers or other family members about his use of inheritance funds to further his\ngambling, and she did not to Applicant\u2019s knowledge. (Tr. 53) Other family members who\nare citizens of Iraq include aunts, uncles, nephews, and nieces to whom he maintains\nno contact, and presumably know nothing about his personal finances. \nWhen interviewed by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in\nApril  2017, Applicant traced his principal gambling activities to the 2009-2010 time\nframe. (GE 4) He confirmed having $80,000 of inherited money, which he initially\ndeposited with a local Iraqi bank before withdrawing the monies ($95,000, inclusive of th\ninherited funds) and placing them with sister for safekeeping before retrieving the funds\n(save for the $10,000 he left with his youngest brother) and subsequently losing his\nretrieved funds to gambling in casinos while traveling in Jordan and Lebanon. (GE 4) He\nconfirmed to the OPM agent that after migrating to the United States in 2011, he\ncontinued his gambling, losing $1,000 or more a week, and all of the $10,000 he had\nstored with his youngest brother and later carried with him to the United States in 2011.\n(GE 4; Tr. 52, 56)\nTo finance his gambling interests, Applicant borrowed over $4,000 from his sister\nand $1,000 from his brother. (GE 4) While denying any addiction to gambling, he\nindicated that the stroke he suffered in August 2015 was likely attributable to losing all\nof his savings to gambling. (Tr. 52-53) Still, he affirmed to the OPM agent that he\ncontinued to gamble while avoiding any disclosure of his gambling to his siblings who\nfrown on the activity. (GE 4) \nApplicant assured at the hearing that he has learned important lessons of\nconserving his financial resources since losing his inheritance money on gambling. (Tr.\n57) In a March 2018 signed, sworn statement he provided at hearing, he pledged to\nnever excessively gamble again. (AE F) By 2015, Applicant (working three jobs) had\ncompleted his instalment repayments of the monies he borrowed from his sister and\nyoungest brother. (Tr. 56-59)  Applicant\u2019s assurances are credible and accepted.\nIn the personal financial statement he prepared in February 2017, Applicant\nreported net monthly income of $899 (inclusive of $189 of food stamps) and monthly\nexpenses of  $657. (GE 3) He reported no outstanding debts and a net remainder of\n$468. (GE 3)\n11\n\nApplicant\u2019s screening questionnaire  omissions \nDuring a counter-intelligence-focused security clearance screening questionnaire\nconducted in February 2017 by an authorized investigator of DoD, Applicant told the\ninvestigator he transferred his inheritance money to his siblings for safe-keeping. (GE 2)\nWhether the investigator ever asked Applicant if the monies were returned to him by his\nsister prior to his departure for Jordan in 2009 is unclear. The screening questionnaire is\nsilent on the question, and Applicant could not remember if he was asked the question\nby the agent. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51)\nWithout any evidence of Applicant\u2019s being asked whether the monies were\nreturned by his siblings, no inferences of falsification of his screening questionnaire can\nbe reasonably drawn. Further, when afforded opportunities to voluntarily disclose his\ngambling losses and loans from his siblings to cover his losses, he did so without\nprompting.  (GE 4; Tr. 51-54)\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well regarded by U.S. advisors operating in Iraq who worked with\nApplicant in the November 2004-March 2005 time frame. (AE C)  Project leaders in Iraq\nwho interacted with Applicant between 2004 and 2008 described him as highly\ncompetent and honest in the translation services he provided. (AE C) They found him to\nbe honest, reliable, and trustworthy in the translation of documents assigned to him\ndespite his absence of formal training in translation services. (AE C) Many of his\ntranslation assignments were difficult and required handling in dangerous conditions. \nApplicant is credited with completing a number of courses for his work with U.S.\nadvisors in Iraq. Certificates of training completion earned by Applicant include the\nfollowing areas: procurement systems, advanced driving, strengthening local\ngovernment and provincial  governance, and safety skills. (AE G) Applicant is credited\nwith receiving numerous awards in recognition of his contributions to the U.S. war effort\nin Iraq in 2004-2008 \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns if any. \n12\n\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.  Although, the guidelines do not\nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the\ncontext of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not\nlimited to, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security\nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Assessment of\nforeign contacts or interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n(see AG \u00b6 6)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\n13\n\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  (AG, \u00b6 15)\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from\ncriminal activity, including espionage. (AG, \u00b6 18)\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n14\n\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States who has family\nmembers (two younger brothers, a sister-in-law, and numerous relatives) who are\ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Trust concerns are raised under the foreign influence\nguideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Iraq. Although his contacts with\nhis brothers and sister-in-law residing in Iraq appear to be somewhat limited, they do\ninvolve close family members. While Iraq is a liberated ally of the United States, it is a\ncountry that has encountered difficulty forming a government in the past and continues\nto experience ethno-sectarian conflicts between principal factions and is considered\nan with a poor human rights record and an unsafe country for U.S. citizens to visit by\nthe U.S. State Department. Additional security concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances and\nscreening question omissions  are also raised.  \nForeign influence concerns\nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily members (i.e., his two younger brothers and sister-law) who are Iraqi citizens\nand still reside in Iraq, a country that is still in the process of establishing a stable\ndemocratic government able to protect all of its disparate constituent groups and\nmaintain peace with its neighbors. Despite encouraging developments in Iraq following\nthe federal elections of May 2018, Iraq is still a very dangerous and volatile country in\ncertain sectors with an overall poor human rights record and heightened risks of\nterrorism in most sectors of the country. \nApplicant\u2019s historically close relationships with his two brothers and sister-in-law\nresiding in Iraq make them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive\nmeasures because of their close familial family ties with Applicant. Because the Iraq\nSecurity Forces (ISF) and non-governmental entities (principally ISIS) operating in\nIraq, as well as the former Iraqi military and intelligence authorities, have a history of\nviolating Iraqi domestic laws and regulations, and international laws, they are more\nlikely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control through his siblings and in-laws. \nNoting that Applicant\u2019s contacts with his Iraqi family members typically take\nplace in potentially hostile security environs, the Government urges security concerns\nover risks that his telephonic contacts with his family members (principally his younger\n15\n\nbrothers and sister-in-law) might be subject to exploitation, coercion, or duress by Iraqi\nmilitary and government authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control. Applicant\u2019s activities warrant some application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline: DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact,\nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d The citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings and sister-in-law in Iraq pose some potential concerns for Applicant because\nof the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified\ninformation under Applicant\u2019s possession and/or control. \nAlthough neither of Applicant\u2019s siblings nor sister-in-law in Iraq have any\nidentified Iraqi military or government service, or other demonstrated links to the Iraqi\ngovernment, they remain potentially vulnerable to pressure and coercion for so long\nas they reside in Iraq (even in places considered to be generally safe from terrorist\nthreats).  Were any of these family members to be placed in a hostage situation,\nApplicant could be subject to conflicts over ensuring his family\u2019s well being and\nprotecting classified information. For this reason, DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d is applicable to the facts of this case. \nStill, from the evidence presented, neither of Applicant\u2019s brothers and sister-in-\nlaw residing in Iraq have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence. These historical antecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. \nAnd while the absence of any past coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does\nnot absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history\nof political instability, violence,  hostage taking, and abusive measures taken against\nits own citizens, the absence of any evidence of pressure or coercion in their family\nhistory is worthy of considerable weight in assessing foreign influence risks of a\npotential hostage situation with Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Iraq.\nThe AGs governing security clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of foreign\ninfluence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not\nbe in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed\non a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security\nassessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new AGs for\nassessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with the individual's having\nfamily abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and\ninformation available from public sources. \n16\n\nMitigation is available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline of the\nAGs.  Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d is  applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. Information about\nApplicant\u2019s family members residing in Iraq, while limited, is enough to permit safe\npredictions about their future safety and exposure to risks of pressure and\ncompromise\nOf benefit to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated service to\nU.S. defense contractors operating in Iraq, while still a resident and citizen of Iraq in\nthe 2004-2008 time period, is impressive and valued by the defense contractors and\nU.S service members he worked for. His contributions to the U.S. defense effort are\nsubstantiated by the numerous endorsements, certificates of training, and awards he\nreceived while working as a linguist for U.S. contractors and military service members \nhe worked with in Iraq between 2004 and 2008. Applicant\u2019s documented  contributions\nto the U.S. defense initiatives in Iraq are sufficiently demonstrated to warrant full\napplication of MC \u00b6 8(b).\nHeightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s presumed close relationships with\nhis younger brothers and sister-in-law residing in Iraq can be safely discounted\nconsidering all the facts and circumstances associated with his work as a linguist for\nU.S. contractors operating in Iraq and relationships with his siblings and sister-in-law\nin Iraq. Iraq\u2019s strategic location and political character and Applicant\u2019s case specific\nrelationships with his family members in Iraq are reconcilable with his holding a\nsecurity clearance to continue his work as a linguist. His demonstrated honest,\nintegrity, and trustworthiness are established and enable him to overcome security\nconcerns over his having family members in Iraq and enable him to surmount foreign\ninfluence concerns.  \nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated gambling losses with money inherited from his family\nin 2009 and later borrowed from his brother and sister are fully documented and\nprovide ample proof of the source of his funds and losses. Applicant does not dispute\nhis use of family inheritance and loans in 2009 to pursue his gambling activities in\ncasinos located in Lebanon and Jordan. His claims that he has not engaged in\ngambling of any kind since 2016 are supported by the admissions he provided the\n17\n\nOPM agent who interviewed him in May 2017 and his statement of intent. Based on\nthe evidence developed in the record, application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines are warranted: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(h), \u201cborrowing money or engaging in\nsignificant financial transactions to fund gambling or pay gambling debts,\u201d and 19(i),\n\u201cconcealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by gambling.\u201d\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business. (see Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980))\nFailure of an applicant to make more concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts\nwhen able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nExtenuating circumstances were never an issue in Applicant\u2019s gambling\ndecisions. Applicant committed his inherited and borrowed funds he received from\nfamily members to finance his gambling interests without any influence brought to\nbear from family members and friends. His accrued gambling losses with the monies \nhe received from his family in inheritance and loans from his sister and youngest\nbrother to cover additional gambling have since been repaid. \nApplicant has learned valuable lessons about the importance of conserving his\nfinancial resources and has pledged to never excessively gamble again. (AE F)\nWorking three jobs, he completed his instalment repayments of the monies he\nborrowed from his sister and youngest brother and is currently debt-free. Financial\nconcerns and personal conduct concerns associated with his past gambling losses are\nmitigated. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuidelines F and E.\nFalsification concerns\nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s falsifying his answers\nto questions posed by a counterintelligence investigator in a February 2017 personal\nsubject interview by telling the investigator he transferred his inheritance money to his\nsiblings for safekeeping without disclosing his retrieval of the monies in preparation for \nhis travel to Jordan. Applicant\u2019s statements to the investigator were accurate regarding\nhis initial transfers to his siblings for safekeeping, but did not include any answers\nabout his ensuing retrieval of the funds he left with his sister for safekeeping. Applicant\nwas never asked by the DoD investigator whether these monies were returned to him\nby his sister, and Applicant never volunteered the information. Without probative\n18\n\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s withholding evidence from the DoD  investigator about his\nretrieved funds from his sister, no inferences can be reasonably drawn of Applicant\u2019s\nintentionally withholding information.\nTaking into account all of the evidence and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of the circumstances surrounding his disposition  of inheritance\nand borrowed funds from his siblings after retrieving most of the funds, conclusions\nwarrant that the allegations are unsubstantiated. Favorable conclusions are warranted\nwith respect to the allegations covered by Guideline E. \nWhole-person assessment\nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain\nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security\nclearance takes account of Applicant\u2019s immigration to the United States to pursue a\nlinguist career with the skills he acquired as a linguist in Iraq. The linguist services he\nprovided for defense contractors operating in Iraq in the 2004-2008 time frame were\nwell received by his superiors and are worthy of commendation. His valued services to\nhis defense contractor employers are enough to overcome the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns over the heightened risks that his siblings and sister-in-law present as\ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Both foreign influence and financial concerns raised\nover his gambling losses are mitigated. Further, security concerns raised over his\nomissions of his gambling losses in the clearance screening questionnaire answers he\nprovided the interviewing investigator are unsubstantiated. Favorable conclusions are\nwarranted with respect to foreign influence, financial, and personal conduct concerns.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas  1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\n                      For Applicant \nGUIDELINE E ([PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant\n19\n\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as test technician with his current employer since March 2013. A 1977 high school graduate, Applicant received a non-credited certificate in electronics in 1986. He has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it until 1990, and was granted it again in 2013. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in 2002. He has been cohabiting since 2013. He has two children, born in 1989 and 1993.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 22, 2013, and again on July 26, 2017, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversions of a Security Clearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to \nthose interrogatories on May 3, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), (December 10, 2016), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n   12/14/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated June 11, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on August 2, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on August 13, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on September 27, 2018. Applicant apparently chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of December 14, 2018, he has not done so. The case was \nassigned to me on December 13, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas test technician with his current employer since March 2013. A 1977 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a non-credited certificate in electronics in 1986. He has \nnever served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it until \n1990, and was granted it again in 2013. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in \n2002. He has been cohabiting since 2013. He has two children, born in 1989 and 1993. \n \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in about 2009 when he was \nordered to pay $1,000 per month in child support. That amount was automatically \ngarnished from his paycheck. In 2010, and 2011, because of the child support obligation \nand the reduction in his overtime hours, Applicant had insufficient funds to cover all of his \nmonthly bills and his residence periodically went into a foreclosure status. He was laid off \nin October 2012, and he remained unemployed until March 2013. His finances improved \nwhen he obtained his present position, and the house is no longer in a foreclosure status. \nBecause of limited funds, although he was aware that he might owe the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) approximately $1,000 in federal income taxes each year, an \namount that he did not have, Applicant decided not to file federal income tax returns over \na number of years. He failed to timely file federal income tax returns for the tax years \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n2008 through 2014, and he had not done so as of June 2018 when he answered the \nSOR.1 As a result of his non-filings, Applicant owes the IRS substantial back taxes, \nalthough the balance has been stabilized by income tax refunds for more recent years \nbeing applied by the IRS to those unpaid taxes, while penalties and interest continue to \naccrue.2 During his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in November 2017, Applicant stated that he would meet with his \naccountant in early 2018 to file those missing income tax returns. During the ensuing \nyear, Applicant has offered no evidence to indicate that he has done so, and his Answer \nto the SOR supports the conclusion that he has not done what he promised to do.3  \nIn addition to his problems with the IRS, Applicant also failed to timely file his state \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2008 through 2014, and he had not done so as of \nJune 2018 when he answered the SOR.4 As a result of his non-filings, Applicant owes the \nstate substantial back taxes. In July 2017, the state department of revenue started \ngarnishing his wages.5  \nIn October 2017, Applicant informed the OPM investigator that his monthly net \nsalary was $2,532, but overtime brought it to $3,132; and his monthly expenses were \n                                                          \n \n1 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual\u2019s gross \nincome and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the \nfollowing applies: \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title \nor by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law \nor regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 \n($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom \nthere is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with \nrespect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect \nto such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first \nsentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \"misdemeanor\" and \"5 \nyears\" for \"1 year.\" \n  \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax. \n \n2 Item 4 (IRS Account Transcripts, various dates); Item 4 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nOctober 16, 2017), at 5; Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 29, 2017), at 7; Item 1 \n(Answer to the SOR, dated June 11, 2018). \n3 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting \nin a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n4 Item 4 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 2, at 5; Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), \nsupra note 2, at 7; Item 1, supra note 2. \n \n5 Item 1, supra note 2; Item 4 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 2, at 6. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n$2,841, to be reduced to $2,157 once his state back taxes are paid. He anticipated being \nable to save funds to address his outstanding federal income taxes.6 It is not known what \nApplicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did report his current net \nmonthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available \nfor discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no \nevidence of any financial counseling. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his \nfinancial situation is now under control.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d7 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d8   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d9 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \n                                                          \n6 Item 4 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 2, at 6. \n \n7 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n8 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n9 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. \nBd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less \nthan a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.10  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d12 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n                                                          \n10 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n11 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n12 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant had seven years of unfiled and unpaid federal and state income taxes \ncovering the years 2008 through 2014. There is evidence that Applicant was unwilling to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns solely because he felt that he did not have \nsufficient funds to pay his taxes. The requirement to file is separate from the requirement \nto pay. The failure to timely file income tax returns has security implications because:13 \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2002)); \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.14 In \nthis instance, while Applicant may now be properly motivated, he still has not taken the \nappropriate actions to actually file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2008 through 2014, or to voluntarily pay his back taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), \nand 19(f) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;15 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;16  \n                                                          \n14 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis \nas inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax \nreturns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \n15 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n16 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties make it \ndifficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties to child support \nobligations, the reduction in his overtime hours, and his unemployment from October \n2012 until March 2013. However, Applicant\u2019s finances improved when he obtained his \npresent position in 2013, but he has still not exhibited any reasonable efforts to file his \nincome tax returns or voluntarily pay his back taxes.  \nAlthough Applicant indicated that he would have an accountant complete the \nfederal and state income tax returns by early 2018, to date, he offered no evidence that \nthe returns were actually filed. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of \nany financial counseling. There is no evidence of disputes. Applicant offered no evidence \nto indicate that his financial situation is now under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.17 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n                                                          \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n17 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.18   \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 59-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor, and he has been serving as test technician with his \ncurrent employer since March 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it \nuntil 1990, and was granted it again in 2013.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Although it is now mid-December 2018, Applicant failed to prove that he had \nfinally filed his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2008 through 2014, \nalthough he promised to do so by early 2018. In addition, other than having his wages \ngarnished by the state to pay his unpaid state income taxes, Applicant has not shown any \nvoluntary effort to pay his federal income taxes. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is \nunknown. Considering the lack of evidence regarding his current finances, I am unable to \nreach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:19 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \n                                                          \n18 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, failing to file his late income tax returns for 2008 through 2014, and \nfailing to take other timely corrective actions. Overall, the evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",
