Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 3, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nMay 10, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 14 financial concerns, including delinquent accounts that were placed for \ncollection or charged off for approximately $29,000 and a 2016 mortgage foreclosure. The Judge \nfound in favor of Applicant on seven of the allegations, including the foreclosure, but against him \non the remaining debts, which totaled approximately $20,000. On appeal, Applicant asserts that \nthe Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person analysis. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his mid-40s, is twice married and divorced and has one adult and two minor \nchildren. He served in the military from 2000 until his honorable discharge in 2010 and has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2007. Since his military discharge, Applicant has worked consistently for \nfederal contractors and private employers with the exception of about five months\u2019 unemployment \nin early 2012 and again in mid-2015, both due to contracts ending. His income was approximately \n$76,000 in 2014, dropped to $37,700 in 2015, and ranged between $65,000 and $75,000 in 2016 \nand 2017. \nThe Judge found that none of the mitigating conditions were fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous and recent. Although he encountered circumstances largely beyond \nhis control, he failed to act responsibly regarding the most significant debt alleged in the SOR, \nnamely a motorcycle loan charged off for over $15,000, and he presented no evidence of voluntary \npayments or payment plans for any of the debts. The Judge concluded that, in consideration of the \nforegoing, Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial delinquencies. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he presented no evidence of \nfinancial counseling, arguing instead that he testified that he engaged in financial counseling \nfollowing his foreclosure and that he was advised by a friend and financial advisor to track and \nprioritize making consistent debt payments. Appeal Brief at 9, 13, 15. The transcript reflects that \nApplicant testified that he received financial counseling following his 2016 foreclosure and had \nrecently reached a point where he could apply some of what he learned. Tr. at 78. When questioned \nabout the type of counseling he received, however, Applicant testified that he did not attend a \nformal class but that his friend, who is a financial advisor, gave him advice on how to improve his \nfinances. He described his friend as \u201ca mentor who went through the same thing with his finances, \nand over time . . . he has done a lot better because he was horrible with his money.\u201d Tr. at 79-80. \nConsidering the informal nature of the counseling that Applicant described and the lack of proof \nthat his friend was a \u201clegitimate and credible source\u201d for financial counseling per AG \u00b6 20(e), we \nfind no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s finding. \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence, and by not properly \napplying the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant argues that \nthe Judge erred in failing to apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) once he found that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial circumstances were largely beyond his control, primarily relying on his periods of under \nand unemployment. Appeal Brief at 11. This argument conflates the requirements of AG \u00b6 20(a), \nwhich contemplates financial problems that are unlikely to recur due to age, frequency, or unusual \ncircumstances, with those of AG \u00b6 20(b), which contemplates financial problems resulting from \ncircumstances largely beyond an applicant\u2019s control. The Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nencountered circumstances largely beyond his control\u201d (Decision at 6) did not necessitate a finding \nthat those circumstances are unlikely to recur or that AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nApplicant next argues that AG \u00b6 20(a) applied because his debts are neither recent nor \nrecurring, noting that, subsequent to his unemployment that occurred \u201caround ten . . . years ago,\u201d \nhe has maintained his finances and has increased his income. Appeal Brief at 11. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s argument, debts that remain outstanding and unaddressed represent a continuing \ncourse of conduct, which undermines any argument that his debts are not recent or are unlikely to \nrecur. See ISCR Case No. 09-01309 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 29, 2010). \nApplicant also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s assessment that AG \u00b6 20(b) did not fully apply \nbecause, aside from the motorcycle loan, the Judge \u201cprovides no analysis for whether [Applicant] \nacted responsibly for the six other debts that were not mitigated in the SOR.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is a two-prong mitigating condition that applies when 1) the conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, and 2) the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Of the seven debts found adversely, Applicant discussed six \nduring his November 2017 security clearance interview. See Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 9-13. \nHe asserted that he began making payments on the motorcycle debt sometime in 2017 but provided \nno documentation to support said payments, and his credit report reflects that he stopped paying \non the account in mid-2015 and it was charged off in late 2015 with no subsequent activity. See \nGE 2 at 9; GE 3 at 3; GE 6 at 3. With respect to the remaining debts, he indicated his plans to \ncontact the lenders and attempt to resolve the accounts by early 2018. GE 2 at 11-13. By his June \n2022 SOR response, however, Applicant was either still researching the debts or had shifted his \nposition to deny liability for some. As of the hearing, Applicant remained unable to document any \nresolution efforts. See Tr. at 53-57, 61-67. While Applicant is correct that the Judge declined to \nanalyze those six adverse debts under the second, responsible action prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), that is \nlikely because there is no evidence corroborating that Applicant took any action on any of those \ndebts at any point since the start of the security clearance process or before. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal simply advocate for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions \nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at \n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Our review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with \nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Applicant requested a hearing. On January 17, \n2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file both his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2018 and that the returns were not yet filed. In responding to \nthe SOR, Applicant denied both allegations, asserting that he had since filed all of the required \nincome tax returns. The Judge found against Applicant on the allegation that he failed to timely \nfile his Federal income tax returns.

He has \nsix adult children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce, and has been married to his \nsecond wife since 2008. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the late 1970s and subsequently \ncompleted some graduate coursework. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2012 \nthrough 2018. He began filing his delinquent Federal returns in December 2019 and completed the \nprocess in November 2022. Applicant acknowledged that he was motivated by his desire to attain \na security clearance. \nUpon filing, Applicant owed the following approximate amounts in delinquent Federal \ntaxes: $31,200 for TY2012, $27,300 for TY2013, and $39,800 for TY2015. He scheduled a post-\nhearing payment of $12,500 for early December 2022 towards the TY2012 arrearage. Applicant \nasserted that the delinquencies reflected on his tax account transcripts will be reduced when the \nIRS further examines his returns, but he provided no documentation from the IRS to corroborate \nlower tax balances. Applicant does not have a payment arrangement with the IRS. \nApplicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns in State A for TYs 2014 through \n2016 but claims that they are now filed. He provided documentation sufficient to prove that he \nfiled for TY2015 in October 2020, but his evidence is insufficient to prove that he filed his State \nA returns for 2014 and 2016. Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns in State B \nfor TYs 2015 through 2018 but claims that they are now filed. Although he provided some \ncorroboration for TY2015, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to prove that he filed his State B \nincome tax returns for TYs 2016 through 2018. Applicant acknowledged that he owed State A and \nState B taxes for the 2015 tax year in the combined amount of about $1,300. He provided no \nevidence of payments towards this tax delinquency. \nApplicant cited several reasons for not timely filing his Federal and state income tax \nreturns, to include: multiple moves, a failed business in 2013, a job loss in 2014, and cancer \ndiagnoses in recent years for both himself and his spouse. When he eventually began addressing \nthe taxes, the pandemic and IRS backlog slowed his efforts to remedy the situation. \nApplicant earned approximately $200,000 per year through his salary and bonuses. He has \nrelatively limited savings. Applicant planned to set up payment arrangements to resolve his \nremaining tax delinquencies once he and the IRS determine his tax indebtedness. He asserted that \nhe has been saving about $300 per month to address his tax delinquencies upon entering into \npayment plans with Federal and state authorities. \nAlthough some of the circumstances that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s tax problems were \narguably beyond his control, none of the reasons Applicant cited \u201ccan reasonably excuse his failure \nto comply with his tax filing obligations for seven years.\u201d Decision at 7. Applicant has filed his \ndelinquent Federal returns, but he has not provided evidence of arrangements with the IRS to pay \nhis significant delinquent taxes beyond one payment of $12,500. Because that payment was made \nafter Applicant realized his clearance was in jeopardy, he \u201cfailed to show this payment was a good\u00ad\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfaith effort to resolve his debt.\u201d Id. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence of filing his \noverdue state returns or of paying his delinquent state taxes. None of the mitigating factors is fully \napplicable. \nDiscussion \nDue Process \nAt the heart of Applicant\u2019s appeal are a number of claims that are best characterized as \ndenial of due process\u2015that he \u201chad inadequate opportunity to provide information and evidence \nto support [his] case.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. As one example, Applicant states that the SOR did not \nprovide him notice that his \u201cgeneral financial condition would also be targeted\u201d in the hearing and \ndecision and that consequently he \u201cdid not prepare and present additional, relevant information \npertaining to [his] finances.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. To the extent that we understand this argument, \nApplicant is claiming that he was unfairly surprised by questions about housing expenses, how \nmuch he is saving to pay his delinquent taxes, and whether he follows a budget or has received \nfinancial counseling. In a related example, Applicant argues that he did not have an adequate \nopportunity to respond to questions about his plan to set aside $300 per month to pay his \ndelinquencies, citing to his \u201cinexperience in legal proceedings.\u201d Id. at 2. In a final example, \nApplicant complains that the Judge asked for his Federal tax transcripts at the close of the hearing, \nthat Applicant provided the same, and that the Judge then based his decision\u2015at least in part\u2015on \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide state tax transcripts as well. Applicant asserts: \nIt appears that when evidence of State returns was not provided, the approach \nshifted from benign to hostile and, with this shift, Decision was expanded well \nbeyond Statement of Reasons. . . . However, I feel that I have been denied a \ncommensurately expanded opportunity to present my case, both in the production \nof evidence and in support of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. [Appeal Brief at 4\u20135.] \nWe are not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s due process arguments. First, Applicant is on \nconstructive notice of the Directive, was provided a copy of the Directive with his SOR and a copy \nof the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s prehearing guidance for DOHA hearings, and was reminded \nby Department Counsel\u2019s letter of April 18, 2022, to read the Directive carefully prior to hearing. \nThe SOR itself put Applicant on notice that his financial issues were of security concern. The \nAdjudicative Guidelines provided further context and considerable detail about the factors that the \nJudge would consider in evaluating his case. In light of those documents, Applicant cannot \nreasonably assert that he was unfairly surprised by questions about the financial decisions he made \nduring the seven years that he failed to file and pay required Federal and state taxes. Although pro \nse applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable \nsteps to protect their rights under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2\u20133 (App. \nBd. Apr. 27, 2018). As a related matter, it merits noting that a Judge may consider unfavorable \nnon-alleged matters (i.e., failure to pay taxes as required) for certain purposes, such as (a) in \nassessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). We find no reason to conclude that the Judge erred in his \nconsideration of non-alleged matters. \nSecond, we note the timeline of this case. Applicant completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA) in March 2019, completed his clearance interview in May 2019, and received \ngovernment interrogatories in late 2019 that required him to submit Federal and state tax account \ntranscripts. In responding to those interrogatories, Applicant did not provide the required tax \naccount transcripts. The SOR was issued in August 2020. Over two years later, at his November \n2022 hearing, Applicant had still not secured Federal or state tax account transcripts. Although he \ntestified that he had filed all delinquent returns, Applicant was unable to recall when he had done \nso. Tr. at 33, 43\u201344. The Judge then afforded Applicant an opportunity post-hearing to provide tax \naccount transcripts that would corroborate his testimony that he had in fact filed. The record \nestablishes that Applicant had ample time to prepare and present his case prior to hearing, that he \nwas afforded a post-hearing opportunity to augment the record, and that he did not request any \nfurther extensions. \nThird, the record does not support Applicant\u2019s dual assertions that the Judge \u201casked\u201d for \nFederal tax transcripts and that he did not ask for state transcripts. During the course of cross-\nexamination, Applicant stated that he wished to \u201cgather transcripts from the relevant agencies \nindicating . . . the status of the returns\u201d in order to give the Judge \u201csomething more concrete than \n. . . [his] record of conversations.\u201d Tr. at 36\u201337. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Judge asked \nApplicant if he wanted the record to be kept open, adding \u201cI\u2019m not requiring you to provide \nadditional documentation. It\u2019s entirely up to you whether you wish to do so. I\u2019m merely giving \nyou the opportunity to provide documents.\u201d Id. at 60\u201361. Applicant responded in the affirmative. \nThe Judge then provided instructions about how to submit any documents by email. In the course \nof that dialogue, the Judge specifically mentioned obtaining state tax documents as well, noting \nthat Applicant testified that his state tax returns had also been filed. Id. at 61\u201362. Throughout the \ndialogue, the Judge reiterated that he was not requiring any documents. Id. at 60\u201363. \nOn appeal, Applicant requests additional time to \u201cresolve matters cited in Decision . . . to \nallow for those efforts to complete, and for them to be documented.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. This \nremedy is not available, as the Appeal Board is prohibited from receiving new evidence and has \nno authority to remand a case for further proceedings unless it identifies an error below that needs \ncorrecting. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.29 and E3.1.33.2. Applicant is not entitled to another hearing and \nanother chance to present his case, as he has not shown that he was denied either a reasonable \nopportunity to prepare for the hearing or a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-01047 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2005).  \nApplicant refers to being \u201cattacked\u201d by Department Counsel at the hearing and by the \nJudge in his decision. Appeal Brief at 3 and 4. The record reveals nothing to support those \nallegations. The arguments of Applicant fail to establish the proceeding was conducted in an unfair \nmanner, and they fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge was impartial and unbiased. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-02322 at 2 (App. Bd.

Instead, that portion of his brief amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. His disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue \nfor a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nAs the Judge noted in his decision, failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules, raising questions as \nto whether he will comply with the rules for protecting classified information. Decision at 6, citing \nISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). The fact that Applicant has recently taken \nthe initial steps to correct his Federal and state tax problems does not preclude careful \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s longstanding prior behavior and how it reflects on his security \nworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4\u20135 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Moreover, as the \nJudge noted, the timing of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts is relevant, as an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial concerns only after his clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nto follow rules and regulations when his personal interests are not threatened. Decision at 7, citing \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nNew Evidence \nApplicant also presents additional information about phone calls with state tax authorities \nin the weeks after the Judge\u2019s decision was issued. As noted above, the Appeal Board is prohibited \nfrom considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive E3.1.29.  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 17, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On February 28, 2023, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline K, the SOR alleged 10 security concerns, including two failures to secure \nclassified documents properly, five instances of bringing her cellphone into a secure facility, and \nthree instances of failure to report her cellphone violations. That same conduct was cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E. The Judge found adversely to Applicant on all Guideline K allegations and \nfavorably to Applicant on the Guideline E allegation.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all \navailable evidence and misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

She holds a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. \nWith the exception of a three-year break between 2011 and 2014, Applicant has worked for her \ndefense contractor employer since 1995. \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s company was awarded a number of new classified projects and \nrapidly expanded both its workforce and its use of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities \n(SCIFs) and Special Access Program Facilities (SAPFs). Although she had previously held a \nsecurity clearance, Applicant had not previously worked in SCIFs or with classified information. \nDuring this period of growth and transition to working in SCIFs, employees were briefed on \nsecurity requirements for working in secure spaces, including the prohibition against bringing \ncellphones into SCIFs. \nBetween September 2015 and January 2017, Applicant entered a SCIF with a cellphone on \nher person on five occasions. Each incident was inadvertent, discovered quickly, and promptly \nremedied by securing the cellphone in a locker. In the first two instances of September 2015 and \nMay 2016, Applicant timely reported the infractions. In both incidents, the security office \nexamined the cellphone, confirmed that there was no compromise, and counseled Applicant about \nthe no-cellphone rule. After the second incident, Applicant no longer brought her company \ncellphone into the building, but she continued to bring her personal phone. \nApplicant inadvertently entered a SCIF with her personal cellphone in her purse or pocket \non three more occasions\u2014in June 2016, July 2016, and early January 2017. Each time, she quickly \ndiscovered the cellphone and removed it, but she failed to report the incidents promptly as required. \nIn mid-January 2017, Applicant attended security refresher training that reinforced the need to \nself-report any security violations or infractions, and she reported all three events. The employer\u2019s \nsubsequent investigation determined that, although each individual event constituted a security \ninfraction, the total of five cellphone incidents and her failure to report three of them rose to the \nlevel of a security violation. \nApplicant received a letter of reprimand after the January 2017 security office \ninvestigation, as well as informal counseling by security staff. Applicant took remedial actions that \nincluded forwarding her personal cellphone calls to her office desk phone, leaving her cellphone \nin her car, and requesting a pager that could be taken into the SCIF. The record does not indicate \nthat she received any remedial security training following her violation. In 2018, the company \nrenovated the work spaces and required employees to relinquish their cellphones upon first \nentering the building to reduce the incidences of cellphones being brought into the SCIFs.   \nIn addition to her cellphone violations, Applicant mishandled classified information on two \noccasions. Although her desk was in a secure space, that space was not approved for open storage, \nand the documents were required to be secured in an approved safe or other locked container. In \nJune 2018, Applicant reported to security that she had inadvertently left a classified PowerPoint \npresentation on her desk overnight. \nIn January 2019, Applicant again reported to security that she had inadvertently left a \nclassified document on her desk overnight. The document had been handed to her by a co-worker, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand Applicant had not initially recognized it to be classified, in part due to the co-worker\u2019s \nadmitted failure to package the document appropriately. Upon recognizing the following day that \nthe document was marked classified, Applicant reported the matter to security. \nIn both instances, the security office determined the infractions to be the result of \nApplicant\u2019s negligence with no risk of compromise. Applicant testified she received a letter of \nreprimand that addressed both her June 2018 and January 2019 infractions. After the latter \nincident, Applicant devised a checklist to use at the end of every workday to ensure nothing in her \narea of responsibility was left unsecured. Applicant also testified concerning incidents in which \nshe either reported security violations of others or brought violations to the offenders\u2019 attention \nand encouraged them to self-report. \nApplicant presented information suggesting that her employer\u2019s security practices were \ndeficient, specifically that training was insufficient because there was no special attention paid to \ncellphone infractions and that she received no remedial training after the incidents. However, the \nsecurity office\u2019s records indicate that Applicant was verbally counseled about the rule against \ncellphones after each reported incident, and she stated multiple times that she understood the rules. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant disclosed another instance in which she brought her \ncompany cellphone into a secure space. Although not alleged in the SOR, this event was explored \nat the hearing and was considered on the issue of mitigation. In January 2017, Applicant \ncompletely deactivated her company cellphone after receiving a pager. Although she was \ninstructed to mail the cellphone to a corporate facility for disposal, Applicant forgot to do so. In \n2019, Applicant brought breakfast to her team in a secure space, as they were working on a \nweekend. She used her travel bag from the car to transport the food and subsequently discovered \nthat the deactivated cellphone was still in the bag. It was not charged and appeared to be inoperable \neven if charged. Shortly thereafter, Applicant mailed the device for disposal. Applicant did not \nreport the matter to her employer because the device was inoperable and because she was wary of \nthe consequences in light of her letter of reprimand from January 2017. \nApplicant has an exemplary performance record. A former supervisor testified on her \nbehalf and her current supervisor submitted a letter of support. Her performance review, letters of \nrecommendation, and community involvement reflect positively on her character and reliability. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis:  The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part. \nApplicant\u2019s last reported violation occurred in January 2019. As to her \nimproper handling of documents in 2018 and 2019, they were infrequent, and she \nis unlikely to repeat those infractions after receiving a second letter of reprimand \nand since devising a checklist to use at the end of every workday. As to her \ncellphone violations, the last infraction occurred five years ago, and she is unlikely \nto repeat them because she uses an approved pager instead of a cellphone. Even \nthough she became busy starting in 2015 and may not have been sensitive to the \nno-cellphone rule before her first infraction, they persisted despite the fact she was \ncounseled about this simple rule each time she self-reported her actions. Although \nshe was aware of the significance of violating this rule, she decided three times to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot self-report because of concerns about the consequences that might result. Not \nonly did Applicant decide to not self-report, she also has not told her employer \nabout the cellphone she brought into the SCIF in late summer or early fall of 2019. \nShe believes doing so would serve no useful purpose and because she, again, was \nconcerned about the consequences. The phone may, indeed, be of no consequence; \nhowever, that is not her determination to make. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant . . . cites a lack of efficiency and follow through by her employer \nin ensuring that she was properly trained in proper security procedures. . . . \n[A]vailable information shows that Applicant knew that she should not bring her \nphone into a SCIF and that her SCIF was not approved for open storage of classified \ndocuments. . . . It is difficult to see how, given Applicant\u2019s experience since 2015, \nhow more training would have helped her better understand her obligations \nregarding cellphone rules, document storage, and most important, self-reporting. \n. \n. \n. \nEach alleged violation or infraction, standing alone, may not be considered \na significant event. However, the record as a whole regarding these events presents \na more repetitive disregard for security procedures, and it does not support a \nconclusion that this conduct will not recur. On balance, available information shows \nthat Applicant has not established any of the . . . mitigating conditions. [Decision \nat 10\u201312.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider all the evidence and failed to \napply the mitigating conditions properly. In particular, Applicant notes that the Judge \nacknowledged that she is unlikely to mishandle classified information or commit cellphone \nviolations in the future and that his decision instead relies primarily on her failure to report several \nof her infractions. Applicant highlights that she did ultimately self-report following annual \nrefresher training: \u201cCharacterization that there was no self-reporting is inaccurate and an error as \nself-reporting this matter was the means in which [a] violation was brought forward[.]\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 2. Regarding the non-alleged cellphone incident\u2014in which she brought her deactivated \ncompany cellphone into the workspace in 2019\u2014Applicant highlights that this matter was \nrevealed \u201cby virtue of my honesty and disclosure of potentially relevant information.\u201d Id. The \nJudge\u2019s decision, she argues, \u201cinaccurately extends the conclusion from a failure to timely report \nto a complete failure to report, which is inaccurate.\u201d Id. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, the Judge\u2019s decision clearly reflects that he \nrecognized that Applicant \u201cfelt the need to clear her conscience\u201d and reported all three incidents \nshortly after the January 2017 annual refresher training. Decision at 5. In his analysis, the Judge \nexplicitly references Applicant\u2019s failure \u201cto timely self-report.\u201d Id. at 9. (Emphasis added.) \nRegarding the company cellphone incident disclosed in Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge notes that \u201cit is commendable that she disclosed that incident as part of this proceeding[.]\u201d \nId. at 11. In sum, the Judge clearly considered those facts that Applicant represents he overlooked. \nAs the Judge noted, \u201caccess to classified information imposes a fiduciary obligation[.]\u201d \nDecision at 13. Once it is established that an applicant has engaged in conduct that has negative \nsecurity implications, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. Because security violations \nstrike at the heart of the industrial security program, an administrative judge must strictly scrutinize \nany claims of reform and rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 9 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, \n2001). \nApplicant notes that the Judge erred in some of his factual findings (e.g., his \ncharacterization of her workspace as a SCIF rather than a SAPF), but Applicant concedes that the \nerrors are comparatively de minimis. We agree\u2014the errors cited are harmless as they did not likely \nhave an impact on the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0104 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n21, 2001). \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 26, 2021, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On May 31, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nRoger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2013 through 2017, and that he carried delinquent Federal and state tax \nbalances totaling approximately $36,000. The Judge found that, although Applicant had filed his \ndelinquent returns, he had done so at various times in 2022, \u201cwell past the issuance of the SOR.\u201d \nDecision at 4. The Judge similarly found that Applicant had repaid some of his delinquent tax \nbalances, but some of the payments post-date the issuance of the SOR. Decision at 4-5.

Appeal Brief at 2. These matters were \ndiscussed at length during the hearing (see Tr. at 26-31, 39-41, 44-45, 84-88) and addressed in the \nJudge\u2019s decision (see Decision at 3), and Applicant has not established that the Judge committed \nany harmful error in his findings of fact about, or analysis of, this information. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge cut off his testimony regarding his legal residence for \ntax filing purposes. Appeal Brief at 6. Our review of the transcript reflects that Applicant \nthoroughly addressed his residency in response to questions posed directly by the Judge. Tr. at 80\u00ad\n83. Although the Judge interrupted Applicant several times, it appears to have been in an effort to \nclarify and confirm Applicant\u2019s answers. At the conclusion of the hearing, Applicant was afforded \nan opportunity to add additional information based on the Judge\u2019s questions and, through counsel, \nhe declined. Tr. at 89. There is no basis in the record to support that Applicant was denied an \nopportunity to present his case or to conclude that he was denied due process. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 09-06224 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2011). \nApplicant next asserts that the amounts alleged as being owed to the various state taxing \nauthorities were inaccurate. Appeal Brief at 3. The amounts alleged in the SOR were drawn from \nApplicant\u2019s own documentation, which included his Federal and state tax returns as drafted by his \ntax preparer in January 2022. See AE F at 74, 86, 106-109, 175, 177. This argument is therefore \nwithout merit. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining argument on appeal appears to stem from his assertion that he has \nfiled his delinquent tax returns and paid all balances owed. An applicant\u2019s correction of past tax \nproblems, however, does not compel a judge to issue a favorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01807 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). Rather, a judge must examine the record and consider \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness in light of such longstanding behavior that evinces \nirresponsibility. A judge must consider the timing of any corrective action, both when evaluating \nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(g), which applies specifically to taxes, as well as other overlapping \nmitigating conditions. Id. (timing should also be considered \u201cin determining whether an applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances, whether an applicant\u2019s past financial deficiencies are \nunlikely to recur, or whether an applicant initiated good-faith efforts to resolve financial \nproblems\u201d). \nIn his October 2017 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he had not \nfiled his Federal and state income taxes since tax year 2013. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 82-84. \nHe reiterated those tax deficiencies during his January 2019 clearance interview, explaining that \nthe failures were due to not understanding the different tax brackets and filing statuses, and because \nhe moved several times during that period and lost receipts for deductions and write-offs. GE 2 at \n4. The SOR was issued in this matter in August 2021 and Applicant acknowledged receipt of the \nsame in December 2021; however, he did not file his 2014 and 2015 Federal returns until mid\u00ad\n2022, and his 2013 return remained unfiled until October 2022, five years after beginning this \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance process. Moreover, it is unclear from the record that Applicant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 \nFederal returns have been filed at all, as the returns created by the tax preparer in early 2022 for \nApplicant\u2019s submission reflect a filing status of Married Filing Jointly, while his Tax Account \nTranscripts reflect that substitute returns were prepared by the Internal Revenue Service with a \nfiling status of Married Filing Separately. See Applicant Exhibit (AE) F at 117, 185; AE J at 251, \n254. \nIn spite of Applicant\u2019s protestations that he began addressing his tax problems prior to \nreceipt of the SOR, it is incontrovertible that his tax problems were longstanding, and that he took \nlittle to no action to address the problems until after his clearance reinvestigation began. Applicant \nappears to simply disagree with the weight that the Judge placed on his corrective actions; \nhowever, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 16, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On December \n7, 2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged twelve delinquent debts. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on \nnine and adversely on the other three, which total about $23,000. Applicant raises the following \nissue on appeal\u2014whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and married, with no children.  He has worked as a systems \nengineer for 20 years. \nBeginning in 2010, Applicant experienced intermittent periods of \nunemployment, but he has been continuously employed since 2016. In his 2019 security clearance \napplication, Applicant disclosed all three debts in issue, asserted that he had communicated with \nthe creditors, and stated his intent to begin payments. In May 2022, Applicant refinanced his home \nand received about $100,000 in cash, but did not use the proceeds from the refinancing to pay his \nSOR debts. At his September 2022 hearing, Applicant produced receipts indicating that he had \nmade payments in August 2022 of $100 on two of the accounts and of $170 on the third account. \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided receipts indicating additional payments in October 2022 on each \naccount.  \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating the [three debts that remain in \nissue]. He did not provide documentary evidence of payments in 2020 and 2021 \ndespite promises on his SCA to initiate payments in 2020. He only made two \npayments on each debt in 2022. According to his IRS tax transcripts, he and his \nspouse received adjusted gross income exceeding $140,000 in [Tax Years] 2018, \n2019, and 2021. He obtained at least $100,000 in cash when he refinanced his house \nin 2022. He did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of these three SOR debts, which now total $15,688. He did not \nestablish a track record of consistent payments on these three debts, and there is \ninsufficient assurance that these three debts are being resolved. [Decision at 10\u2013 \n11.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. He argues, for example, that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to \u201cthe \nrecency of [Applicant\u2019s] conduct\u201d, which he asserts \u201cbegan remote in time from 2013 to 2015 when \n[Applicant] and his wife both experienced bouts of unemployment and underemployment.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 7. It is well established, however, that an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline \nF mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016). \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that he has made progress on other debts and \u201csimply addressed \nthese debts last, but still showed concomitant conduct of arranging a payment plan and making \npayments toward his plan as agreed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. The record, however, supports the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant made only two payments on each of the three debts in 2022 and \nthat he has failed to establish a track record of consistent payments.  Decision at 10\u201311. \nApplicant argues that the Judge \u201cplaced significant weight on Applicant\u2019s 2020 tax year.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 11. As we have previously stated, a judge may consider non-alleged debts for the \nfollowing purposes: (a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole person concept.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01232 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2022). The Judge\u2019s determination to \nconsider this non-alleged issue for these limited purposes is well-rooted in the precedent to which \nhe cited. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Applicant relies on hearing-level decisions in other \ncases to argue the Judge erred in his analysis of this case, but those cases are neither binding \nprecedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s analysis and decision in \nthis case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable. \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 10, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  On November \n28, 2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on three SOR allegations and against her on the \nremaining five allegations. These latter allegations asserted that Applicant had five delinquent \ndebts totaling about $30,100. In her SOR Response for three of those debts, Applicant stated, \u201cI \nagree that, this account was closed and removed. Statue [sic] of limitations met on this account. \nAccount opened in previous marriage.\u201d For the other two allegations, she submitted nearly \nidentical responses, stating the accounts were \u201csatisfied closed\u201d and, for one of these allegations, \nshe omitted the sentence about the opening of the account during a previous marriage.

In his analysis, \nthe Judge concluded that Applicant experienced conditions beyond her control that contributed to \nher financial problems, but that she failed to establish that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, noting she had taken inconsistent positions throughout the security investigation \nregarding her responsibility for several of the delinquent debts. The Judge also noted Applicant \nprovided no documentation of actions taken to address the five remaining debts at issue and \nconcluded there was no clear evidence that her financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol.  \nWe construe Applicant\u2019s brief as challenging the Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings and his \nweighing of the evidence. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nEvidentiary Rulings \nAt the hearing, Applicant objected to the admission into evidence of various documents. \nThese objections included her security clearance application, a credit report, and a Westlaw record \nof an eviction filing in a state court. These documents are official records or evidence complied \nor created in the regular course of business and are admissible under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 without \nauthenticating witnesses. Examples of Appeal Board decisions addressing the admissibility of \nsuch official records include: ISCR Case No. 19-00673 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2020) (security \nclearance applications); ISCR Case No. 18-00552 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan 18, 2019) (credit reports); \nand ISCR Case No. 14-00019 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2014) (state court records). In general, \nApplicant\u2019s objections to the above-identified documents relate to the weight to be given them \nrather than to their admissibility. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s rulings admitting those \ndocuments into evidence. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant also objected to a summary of Applicant\u2019s personal subject \ninterview (PSI) (Government Exhibit (GE) 2) that the Judge admitted into evidence. This \nevidentiary ruling merits further discussion. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, a DoD personal \nbackground report of investigation (ROI) may be received into evidence with an authenticating \nwitness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. GE 2, being part \nof an ROI, is subject to this authentication requirement. At the hearing, the Government called no \nwitness to authenticate GE 2. \nApplicant objected to GE 2 because it was obtained before she obtained legal services to \nhelp her with the debts, and she did not know specifics about the debts when she was interviewed. \nDuring the exchange at the hearing regarding this document, Applicant also indicated she was \nunaware of what \u201cdiscrepant\u201d meant in the PSI. After explaining that term, the Judge asked, \u201cIs \nthere any reason why you believe this exhibit should be not be received in evidence?\u201d Applicant \nresponded by saying, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Besides the fact that I didn\u2019t know that those accounts were \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere at the time, I don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d Tr. at 23. The Judge then admitted GE 2 into \nevidence. In the decision, the Judge noted, \u201cAfter receiving explanations about certain words with \nthe exhibit, Applicant withdrew her objection, though she indicated she was unaware of the \ndelinquent accounts at the time of the April 2019 interview.\u201d Decision at 2. We do not interpret \nApplicant\u2019s response to the Judge\u2019s question as withdrawing her objection to GE 2. \nAt the hearing, Applicant was not informed about the authentication requirement of \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. She was not asked if GE 2 was an accurate report of what she said during the interview, \nasked if she was adopting GE 2 as her statements, or otherwise questioned about the accuracy or \nauthenticity of that document. Nor is there any basis in the record to conclude she waived the \nauthentication requirement in \u00b6 E3.1.20 in regards to GE 2. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01097 at \n4, n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2022) for the proposition that a party may manifest adoption of a \nstatement in a number of ways, including through words or conduct. However, we find no \nevidence of Applicant adopting GE 2 in this case.  In the absence of any form of authentication or \nwaiver, GE 2 was not admissible under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01649 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021) (error for Judge to consider unauthenticated portion of ROI). Even though \nthe Judge erred in admitting GE 2 into evidence, this error was harmless because it did not likely \naffect the outcome of the decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, \n2020). Other admissible evidence in the record was sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s unfavorable \nclearance decision. \nAnother aspect of the Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings regarding GE 2 merits clarification. In \naddressing this exhibit, the Judge stated, \u201cIn security clearance investigations, an applicant has no \nright to an attorney because the process is not criminal in nature.\u201d Decision at 2. In her appeal \nbrief, Applicant takes issue with that statement. To the extent that the Judge is stating that security \nclearance applicants do not have the same right to counsel as indigent criminal defendants, we \nagree. However, the Judge\u2019s statement, as written, is overbroad. Applicants may consult with \ncounsel at their own expense during security clearance investigations and have a right to be \nrepresented by counsel during ensuing adjudications. See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 3(5) and \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 4.3.4 and E3.1.8. See also Executive Order 12968 \u00a7 5.2(a)(3). That said, we note \nApplicant\u2019s statements about seeking attorneys to represent her pertained to a debt resolution \nprogram. Applicant made no claim that she sought the assistance of counsel directly in her security \nclearance adjudication and was denied such representation. Based on our review of the record, \nthere is no reason to conclude that Applicant\u2019s right to counsel under the Directive was infringed. \nFindings of Fact and Weighing of the Evidence \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in the findings of fact. In doing so, she argues that \ndebts were removed from her credit report, that payments were made to satisfy debts, and that she \nwas a victim of a credit bureau breach or of some form of fraud. These contentions, however, do \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot constitute a challenge to any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact but instead amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. Applicant\u2019s arguments also highlight \nher efforts to dispute or resolve the alleged debts. She further contends that the SOR allegations \nare \u201cincorrect\u201d (Appeal Brief at 2) and asserts that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence. \nIn his analysis, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations does \nnot constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial delinquencies (citing ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) as support); that she provided no documentation of actions \ntaken to address the five alleged debts at issue; and that her explanations regarding the debts were \nnot consistent. In this regard, the Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for a \nJudge to expect an applicant to present documents corroborating actions taken to resolve debts.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Furthermore, there is more than \none plausible explanation for the absence of debts from a credit report\u2e3asuch as the removal of \ndebts due to the passage of time\u2e3aand the absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit \nreport does not extenuate or mitigate an overall history of financial difficulties or constitute \nevidence of financial reform or rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 17, 2017). In short, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that \nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence \nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 31, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. On April 4, 2023, after close of the record, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed the Federal Government approximately \n$113,000 in delinquent taxes for seven tax years (2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018); \nthat he owed a state approximately $39,000 in delinquent taxes for three tax years (2010, 2011, \nand 2012); and that he failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income tax returns for eight \nyears (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2021).

The Judge \nconcluded: \nApplicant has made significant progress towards satisfying his delinquent \nfederal and state income taxes. However, given the length of time that his taxes \nwere delinquent, and the inconsistency with which he has made payments over the \nlast 18 months, it is not clearly consistent with the national security at this time to \ngrant Applicant a security clearance.  [Decision at 1.] \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge erred by failing to consider all of \nthe record evidence. For example, he argues that Applicant\u2019s \u201coutstanding federal tax debt has \nbeen fully resolved, which is significant and something that was overlooked by the Administrative \nJudge[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. This argument is simply not accurate. The Judge found that, by \nSeptember 2021, Applicant had satisfied his Federal tax delinquencies by making monthly \npayments ranging between $1,000 and $22,000. Decision at 3. Additionally, as noted above, the \nJudge found in favor of Applicant on the Federal tax debt allegations. Applicant\u2019s Counsel further \nargues the Judge did not take into account that \u201cApplicant had/has a plan in place to resolve his \noutstanding [state] tax obligations.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. This argument is also baseless. The Judge \nfound that Applicant had established a payment plan to resolve his remaining state tax deficiency \nand had made five payments totaling about $10,000 under that plan. Decision at 3. In short, none \nof the arguments presented are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of \nthe evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also argues that the Judge erred in his analysis by misapplying the \nmitigating conditions and whole-person concept. These arguments amount to a disagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. For example, he contends that Applicant has learned from \nhis past mistakes and highlights that Applicant\u2019s divorce was a circumstance beyond his control \nthat contributed to his financial problems. However, determining the weight to be given to the \nevidence is a matter within the special province of the Judge as the trier of fact. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00857 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019) (citing Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives \nLaboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 (1982)). \nCounsel\u2019s arguments for an alternative \ninterpretation of the evidence are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in \na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2. \nIn his brief, Applicant\u2019s Counsel relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F \ncases to argue the Judge erred in his analysis of this case.  His reliance on hearing-level decisions \nis misplaced because each case must be judged on its own merits. AG \u00b6 2(b). As the Board has \npreviously stated, how particular facts scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is \ngenerally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. Hearing Office decisions may be \nuseful to highlight a novel legal principle; but only in rare situations\u2e3asuch as separate cases \ninvolving spouses, cohabitants, or partners in which the debts and the financial circumstances \nsurrounding them are the same\u2e3awould the adjudication outcome in another case have any \nmeaningful relevance in our review of a case. The Hearing Office decisions that Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel cites have no direct relationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case that would make them \nrelevant here.

Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had 10 delinquent debts totaling about \n$53,200, including a check drawn on insufficient funds for about $200; that he failed to file, as \nrequired, his Federal and state income tax returns for 2018; that he was indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for 2019 delinquent taxes in an unspecified amount; and that he \u201crepeatedly engaged \nin kiting by transferring over $100,000 between checking accounts held at different banks using \nchecks, ATM withdrawals, and cash deposits\u201d between 2016 and 2018.

In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations with \nexplanations and denied the Guideline E allegation. The Judge found against Applicant on the \nGuideline F allegations and in favor of him on the Guideline E allegation. \nThe Judge summarized the case as follows: \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial problems were triggered by circumstances \nbeyond his control, and some of his financial indebtedness can be attributed to poor \ndecisions. He was involved in fraudulent financial practices, and he has not filed \nhis 2018 state and federal income tax returns. He filed for bankruptcy protection \nshortly after his receipt of the SOR, and it remains pending as of the close of the \nrecord. He did not sufficiently mitigate the financial consideration . . . security \nconcerns.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 30, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record, but the Government requested a hearing. On October \n24, 2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged: that in about October 2016 Applicant met a Chinese \nnational female (A) through a Chinese dating website and that in about January 2017 he met her \nin person in the United States; that in 2015 he provided financial support to a Filipino national \nfemale (B) and that he had sent money between 2005 and 2006 to another female foreign national \n(C); and that he failed to fully disclose his association with these foreign nationals. Under \nGuideline E, the SOR alleged: that Applicant failed to disclose his foreign contacts on his \nNovember 2016 security clearance application (SCA); that he falsely denied any contacts with \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign nationals in January 2017 during an investigation by his employer; and that he remained \nin contact with at least two resident citizens of China whom he met through a dating website. The \nJudge found adversely to Applicant on the Guideline B allegation that he failed to disclose his \nassociations with foreign nationals and on the Guideline E allegation that he falsely denied contacts \nwith foreign nationals during his employer\u2019s investigation.  She found favorably for Applicant on \nthe remaining allegations. On appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider the \nevidence in mitigation, rendering her decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. For the \nreasons stated below, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his mid-sixties, married, with two adult children. He was honorably \ndischarged from the Reserve force in the early 1980s. He has held a clearance since the 1970s and \nhas worked for his current employer since the 1980s.    \nDuring his employer\u2019s security briefing for new hires in the late 1980s, Applicant learned \nof the requirement to report suspicious contacts with foreign nationals. As an amateur radio \noperator, he frequently had contact with foreign nationals and asked security officials whether he \nhad to report those contacts. The security officer advised him to provide his radio log books \noccasionally for review. Applicant did so for several years but then became inactive as a radio \noperator for a period of time. \nFrom 2005 to 2009, Applicant was an active member of a Japanese dating website. From \n2006 to 2008, he was an active member of a Philippine dating website. He accessed these foreign \nwebsites two or three times per week and did not inform his spouse about the activity. In about \n2006, Applicant had online contact with C, a Filipino citizen and resident. They had online contact \nabout two dozen times over a few months, and Applicant sent her about $300 to help with bills. \nFrom about 2010 to 2015, Applicant had online contact with another woman from the Philippines, \nB, on about a dozen occasions. Between September and October 2015, Applicant sent B about \n$250 to help with bills. \nIn about 2014, Applicant resumed his amateur radio activities and asked a security manager \nat work whether he had to provide his log books and report his contacts. In that context, the \nsecurity manager informed Applicant that reporting an incidental foreign contact was not required \nunless a close and continuing relationship developed or there was any attempt to elicit information. \nApplicant did not disclose to the security manager that he used a foreign dating site to meet foreign \nnationals.  \nIn 2012, Applicant joined a Chinese dating website. In response to DOHA interrogatories, \nApplicant indicated that he closed this account in 2015. However, other evidence indicates that \nhe met A on the website in October 2016 and that they had contact by text. In January 2017, A \ncame to the United States to visit family and friends and met Applicant for lunch on January 10, \n2017. After A returned to China, she and Applicant continued to have online contact for a short \nperiod of time.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLater that same month, a security manager at Applicant\u2019s firm was given text and email \nmessages between Applicant and A. They were forwarded by a friend of A\u2019s who was concerned \nabout the relationship. The messages revealed that Applicant had been in contact with A for about \ntwo months by text and email prior to their lunch on January 10, 2017. \nIn the ensuing internal investigation, the investigators discovered that Applicant had not \nreported any foreign contacts on his recently completed SCA and that his profile page on the \nChinese dating website stated that he had frequent work trips to Japan, from which he could easily \ntravel to China. \nOn January 19, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by his firm\u2019s counterintelligence \npersonnel. He initially denied that he had any foreign contacts. Regarding the Chinese dating \nwebsite, Applicant told the investigators that his wife was unaware of his contacts on the website. \nHe denied that he had in person contact with any of the women with whom he communicated and \ndenied that he had provided any of them money. After a reminder to be honest about any in-person \nmeetings, including with A, Applicant admitted that he had met with her the prior week. \nShortly thereafter, the investigators found two receipts for wire transfers in Applicant\u2019s \ndesk from 2015 totaling $250, addressed to B in the Philippines. Applicant was re-interviewed \nthe following week to discuss the wire transfers. Applicant admitted that he provided the money \nto B in 2015, but claimed that he did not recall the wire transfers during the prior interview. He \ndenied providing any money to any other foreign nationals. After being told that an adverse \ninformation report would be filed, with a resulting government investigation, Applicant admitted \nthat he had previously provided C approximately $300 during the 2005\u20132006 timeframe. The \nemployer issued a written warning for not being completely truthful during the investigation and \nfiled an incident report with DoD.  \nIn July 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a security clearance background investigator. \nWhen asked about any additional foreign contacts, Applicant disclosed that he had contact with \ntwo women in China. \u201cHe stated that he did not know much about them and did not consider them \nto be close and continuing contacts, so he had not reported them to his security office.\u201d Decision \nat 7. Applicant reported that he continued to contact women via the Chinese dating website. He \nrelated that his wife first learned about his contacts with female foreign nationals in February \n2017,when he told her in light of his employer\u2019s adverse information report.  \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in January 2021, Applicant confirmed that he was in \ncontact with the two Chinese women discussed during his background interview. He reported that \nhis contacts with them varied in frequency from two to three times per week, to daily at times, to \nsome weeks with no contact.  He had not met either of them in person but had video chats several \ntimes from his home. He provided them with information about his family and discussed U.S. and \nChinese politics.  \nAt his August 2022 hearing, Applicant \u201ctestified discrepantly that his contacts with the two \n[Chinese] women stopped \u2018about three years ago.\u2019\u201d Decision at 7, citing Tr. 35, 55. When \nconfronted with his January 2021 admission to current contact with them, Applicant responded \nthat he had some contact with the women in 2020. He indicated that he did not believe his contacts \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith them were reportable to his employer because they were not close and continuing. \nConversely, he also testified that he reported the contacts to his employer, but submitted no \nevidence to corroborate that claim. \nAt hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally lied during his company\u2019s investigation \ninto his foreign contacts, asserting that he did not think his in-person meeting with A needed to be \nreported because it was not suspicious. He asserted that his spouse knew at the time that he \naccessed foreign dating websites. He stated that both his employer\u2019s report of investigation and \nthe summary of his background interview were inaccurate in reporting that he had said otherwise \nat earlier junctures. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted in pertinent part. \nGuideline B \nApplicant made much of the fact that he is a longtime amateur radio \noperator. However, the Guideline B concerns in this case involve his unrelated \ncontacts via foreign dating websites, texts, emails, and video chatting with female \nforeign nationals living abroad. . . . He was a member of a [Japanese] dating site \nfrom 2005 to 2009, a [Filipino] dating site from 2006 to 2008, and a [Chinese] \ndating site from 2010 through at least 2016, when he met [A]. He had online contact \nwith [C] about 24 times over a couple of months in 2006. He had online contact \nwith [B] about 24 times between 2010 and October 2015. He met [A] in October \n2016 via a [Chinese] dating website. Applicant\u2019s efforts to equate his contacts with \nthese foreign nationals to random encounters of the type he might have while on \nvacation with foreign persons is not persuasive.  [Decision at 10\u201311.] \nThe evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s contacts with [A] of [China] were ongoing as \nof his November 2016 [SCA] and were certainly recent as of his employer\u2019s \nJanuary 2017 investigation into his unreported contacts with her. Applicant falsely \ndenied any foreign contacts when first questioned during his employer\u2019s \ninvestigation. He was required to cooperate with his employer\u2019s investigation and \ndisclose his foreign contacts, and he admitted that he had contact with [A] only \nafter he was confronted with proof of his contacts by the counterintelligence \npersonnel. Disqualifying condition AG 7(c), \u201cfailure to report or fully disclose, \nwhen required, association with a foreign person, group, government, or country,\u201d \napplies.  [Id. at 12.] \nIn one important aspect, the concerns of undue foreign influence are not \ncompletely mitigated. Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be counted on \nto promptly disclose any reportable foreign contacts in the future. He continues to \nhold the opinion that \u201ca single event occurrence of a contact, even in person, is not \nreportable.\u201d Even as to an exchange of multiple emails and texts to a foreign \nnational, Applicant testified that he does not view the contact as continuous, even \nif it occurs every couple of months. . . . He testified that he last accessed an online \ndating site some three years ago, but the evidence shows that he began contact with \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntwo new [Chinese] female resident citizens . . . via the dating website in the year \npreceding his July 2019 [interview]. He continued to have online contact with them \ndespite knowing of the concerns presented by [China]. In January 2021, he wrote \nof his contacts with them in the present tense. While he asserts that he informed \nhis employer about those contacts through the [background] investigator, there is \nno proof that his employer is aware of his more recent contacts with [Chinese] \nnationals. [Id. at 13.] \nGuideline E \nApplicant exhibited an unacceptable lack of candor about his foreign contacts \nduring his employer\u2019s investigation in January 2017. During his first interview \nwith his employer\u2019s counterintelligence personnel, Applicant denied any foreign \ncontacts. After being reminded of his responsibility to be truthful and cooperative, \nhe denied ever meeting any of the foreign women in person and ever providing \nthem any money. It was only after he was further reminded to be honest and was \nshown proof of his recent in-person meeting with [A] that Applicant admitted he \nhad lunch with the [Chinese] female. When re-interviewed to discuss the wire \ntransfer receipts found in his desk at work, Applicant stated he did not think about \nthe transfers. He claimed that the two money transfers were the only ones. It was \nonly after he was told that the company would be submitting an adverse information \nreport that he admitted to providing about $300 to [C] in 2006.  [Id. at 14\u201315.] \nApplicant has claimed to have acted on the advice of a security manager that only \nclose and continuing contacts or those of a suspicious nature are required to be \nreported. The security manager indicated that he met with Applicant in 2014 \u201cabout \nforeign reporting requirements due to his involvement in amateur radio.\u201d He told \nApplicant that reporting incidental foreign contacts was not required unless a \u201cclose \nand continuing\u201d relationship developed or there was any attempt to elicit \ninformation about his job that was outside the scope of normal conversation in \nmeeting someone. Applicant cannot reasonably rely on that advice for mitigation \n. . . because the advice was given with the understanding that it pertained to amateur \nradio contacts. Applicant never informed the security manager that he had joined \nforeign dating websites or maintained contacts with women he met on those dating \nsites.  \nAlthough some five years have passed since Applicant lied during his \nemployer\u2019s investigation into his foreign contacts, [no mitigating conditions] fully \napply due to ongoing concerns for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \nApplicant exhibited a lack of candor at his hearing in several aspects. [Decision at \n16.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in that she failed to consider all the evidence in mitigation and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\u201ceffectively ignored the applicable mitigating conditions.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. Through counsel, \nApplicant primarily relies on two arguments throughout his brief. First, counsel for Applicant \nargues that the Judge failed to consider the passage of time as a mitigating factor and states \nrepeatedly that Applicant\u2019s last contact with a foreign national was in 2017. Id. at 6, 7, and 11. \nInstead, the record fully supports the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant contacted two women in China \nvia a Chinese dating website in the year prior to his July 2019 background investigation interview; \nthat he continued to have online contact with them despite knowing of the concerns presented by \nChina; and that, in January 2021, he described his contacts with them in the present tense. Decision \nat 13. The argument of Applicant\u2019s counsel regarding the passage of time is contradicted by the \nevidence of record. \nSecond, throughout his appeal brief, Applicant reiterates the argument that he made at \nhearing\u2014that his failure to report the contacts was \u201can honest mistake on his part\u201d based on advice \nhe had received from his security officer regarding \u201cclose, frequent, and continuous contact.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 9.  See also, Appeal Brief at 6, 10, 11, and 12. The record, however, supports the \nJudge\u2019s determination that Applicant never informed the security manager that he had joined \nforeign dating websites or maintained contacts with women he met on those sites and that the \nsecurity manager\u2019s advice was instead given in the context of Applicant\u2019s amateur radio hobby. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s contacts with foreign nationals via foreign dating websites, texts, \nemails and video chats were unrelated to his amateur radio hobby. Decision at 10. This finding \nis well supported by the evidence, as is her conclusion that \u201cApplicant cannot reasonably rely on \nthat advice for mitigation.\u201d Id. at 16.  \nAdditionally, we note the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination and defer to it.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In arriving at her adverse determination, the Judge concluded that Applicant \nnot only lied during his employer\u2019s investigation but also \u201cexhibited a lack of candor at his hearing \nin several aspects,\u201d and she provided a detailed analysis of the instances in which he was not candid \nor truthful. Decision at 16. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in her whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching her decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient \nto undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, \n2018). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nMarch 26, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  \nApplicant requested a hearing. On November 2, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on 11 Guideline G allegations and 9 cross-alleged \nGuideline J allegations. These asserted that Applicant was arrested and charged with various \nalcohol-related offenses between 1999 and 2016, including driving under the influence (DUI) on \nsix occasions, fleeing or evading police, breaking and entering, illegal entry and larceny, and \ncriminal trespass. Applicant pled guilty to many of those charges or to lesser offenses. His most \nrecent alcohol-related driving offense was in 2016.

In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of these allegations with \nclarifying and mitigating information. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, misapplied the mitigating \nconditions, and misweighed the evidence.

He holds a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree and is seeking a security clearance in connection with his employment by a Defense \ncontractor, a job he has held since 2019. \nBetween late 2017 and mid 2018 Applicant used a prior employer\u2019s computer to stream \nand view pornographic videos and images. This was in violation of company policy. When doing \nso, he used the InPrivate mode, which enabled him to explore the internet without leaving a \nbrowsing history, temporary internet files, cookies, etc., thereby attempting to conceal conduct \nthat he knew was in violation of company policy. By gaining access to videos and images through \nYouTube and other sites, Applicant introduced malware into his employer\u2019s IT system. \nUpon discovery of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, his employer conducted an investigation.  \nWhen interviewed by company officials, Applicant provided false or misleading answers until they \nconfronted him with evidence. After the investigation was completed, the employer gave \nApplicant a choice of resigning or being fired. He chose the former option. Applicant provided \nfalse statements to an investigator during the course of his clearance interviews. Specifically, he \nstated that he thought that, because the sites he accessed were not blocked, that it was acceptable \nto view pornographic content on them. However, he knew that his conduct was not acceptable \nand that other employees had gotten into trouble for similar behavior.  \nApplicant also provided misleading information on his 2019 security clearance application \n(SCA). He stated that the reason he left his prior employment was the lack of a long-term career \npath following his inadvertent introduction of malware onto the employer\u2019s IT system. He also \nstated that, upon discovery of the malware, his prior employer suspended him with pay and that \nsuch action did not constitute formal discipline.  \nApplicant was not truthful in his response. Applicant\u2019s misconduct instigated a \nformal investigation that concluded that he violated company policy, resulting in \nhis job termination. In lieu of termination, Applicant was suspended without pay \nduring the investigation period, and the company would have fired him for cause \nhad he not taken the option they gave him to resign.  Decision at 3.  \nApplicant admitted that he had initially attempted to deny his misconduct. He stated that \nhe always knew that his actions were wrong and in violation of company policy. He attends regular \nsessions with a certified sex-addiction counselor and belongs to a support group for those suffering \nfrom that condition. Applicant believes that his problems stem from the trauma of having been \nmolested as a child. Applicant\u2019s character evidence cites to progress that he has made in \naddressing his problems and rates him highly for integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge cited to the nature of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity-significant conduct and his knowledge that it violated company policy. \nThough \nrecognizing that several years had passed since the last incident, the Judge concluded that, due to \nits egregiousness, it continues to cast doubt upon Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The Judge also cited to Applicant\u2019s false or misleading statements regarding his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \ninfractions, concluding that if he \u201cdid not consider his discipline to be a formal punitive action, he \nwas wrong.\u201d Decision at 8.

He contends that he did not intend \nto mislead in his answers to questions regarding his employment or in his answers during his \nclearance interview. Regarding the explanation in his SCA for having left his former job, \nApplicant stated that it had been the result of an inadvertent introduction of malware into his \nemployer\u2019s IT system. He did not disclose the true reason for his resignation, which was his \nemployer\u2019s discovery of his knowing and willful violation of company policy by accessing \npornography with company IT equipment. The Judge did not err in finding that this answer was \nmaterially misleading. Regarding Applicant\u2019s claim in the same SCA that he had not been \nsuspended without pay or subjected to formal discipline, the evidence is less clear. While the \nemployer advised the CAF at the beginning of its investigation that Applicant had been suspended \nwithout pay, Applicant himself contended that this decision was rescinded after the company \ninvestigation was completed. Item 7, Employer Message to CAF; Interview Verification \u2013 \nAdditional Facts, included in Item 5, at 13. The evidence as a whole does not refute Applicant\u2019s \ncontention that his employer ultimately compensated him for the time he was under suspension. \nIn any event, although Applicant\u2019s SCA answer did include a denial that he had been subjected to \nformal discipline, which a reasonable person could find specious, he did state \u201cyes\u201d to the \nfollowing question: \u201c[I]n the last seven (7) years, have you received a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a \nviolation of security policy?\u201d Item 4 at 19. As this \u201cyes\u201d pertained to the misconduct at issue in \nthis case, we conclude that this SOR answer, viewed as a totality, is not materially misleading. \nThe Judge\u2019s finding to the contrary is erroneous. \nApplicant challenges the finding that he had misled the clearance investigator during his \ninterview. The pertinent language is as follows: \u201c[Applicant] continued to access the adult site \nand because it was not blocked by the company IT . . . he thought it was OK.\u201d Interview Summary, \nincluded in Item 5, at 7. The company investigation discloses that, although he initially denied \nknowing that his conduct was prohibited, Applicant finally admitted to the contrary after they \nconfronted him with evidence. Report of Employer Investigation, included in Item 8, at 3. In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s having used the InPrivate mode for viewing the videos and images in \nquestion most reasonably suggests an attempt to evade discovery, which he would not likely have \ndone had be really believed that his conduct was permitted. The record supports the Judge\u2019s \nfinding that this portion of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview answer is materially false. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \nOn the question of whether the false or misleading statements were deliberate, we note the \nembarrassing nature of Applicant\u2019s misconduct,1 his efforts described above to avoid detection, \nand the multiple nature of his false statements, including those to his employer, which he has \nadmitted. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08163 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2017) for the proposition \nthat the multiple nature of false statements can give rise to an inference that they are deliberate. \nThe record viewed as a whole supports the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant\u2019s description in his \nSCA of his reason for having left his former job was deliberately misleading and that his claim to \nthe clearance investigator that he believed that his conduct was not forbidden was deliberately \nfalse.2 Although the Judge\u2019s findings may have contained errors such as those identified above, \nthey are harmless in that they did not likely affect the overall outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Applicant has not cited to any harmful error in \nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact. The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  \nApplicant contends that his misconduct does not \u201ccorrelate to a national security risk, nor \ndoes [his] choice to lie to company representatives in an effort to conceal [his] personal \nmisbehavior correlate to [his] willingness to comply with national security standards.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 4. We construe this as an argument that his conduct does not raise security concerns. We \nnote first of all that the Directive presumes a nexus between admitted or proved conduct and an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4. Moreover, evidence \nthat Applicant knowingly misused his employer\u2019s IT system and that he made false statements \nabout that behavior raises reasonable questions as to his willingness to comply with rules and  \nregulations, thereby prompting concerns that he may not protect sensitive information. See \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b\u204b 15, 39. The Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant\u2019s conduct \nraised security concerns. \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that he had not mitigated any \nconcerns arising from his security-significant conduct. He draws our attention to the four years \nthat have elapsed since his last incident of IT system misuse, his having engaged in counseling to \nresolve his problems, and the support he enjoys from his wife, who is aware of his circumstances.  \nThese matters are not frivolous and certainly weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, given (1) that \nApplicant knowingly and repeatedly misused his employer\u2019s IT system over the course of several \nmonths; (2) that the misconduct was, by Applicant\u2019s admission, addictive or compulsive, \n1\u201cI attempted to deny my behavior and maintain secrecy until I was no longer able to do so . . . I lied to [employer] \ninvestigators not only to avoid the consequences for my actions, but also to avoid the pain and embarrassment of \ntraumatic exposure in front of a mixed gender panel of complete strangers.\u201d Response to File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) at 4. \n2 Applicant contends that his SCA answer was based upon advice that he received from officials at his former place \nof employment that his only reportable offense was the introduction of malware into the employer\u2019s IT system. \nResponse to FORM at 1-2. He advises that he sought, but did not receive, corroborating statements on this matter. \nWe note that the employer\u2019s message to the CAF specifically referenced Applicant\u2019s having viewed pornography \n(Item 7) and that there is nothing in the record to corroborate Applicant\u2019s claim that the employer considered his only \nreportable offense to have been an inadvertent introduction of malware. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to \ndemonstrate that in completing his SCA in connection with follow-on employment Applicant relied upon \u201cadvice of \nlegal counsel or of a person with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing [him] concerning security \nprocesses.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 17(b). Given that the previous employer gave Applicant a choice of resigning \nor being fired by having accessed pornography on his official computer, he could not honestly have believed at the \ntime he completed his SCA that his answer to the question at issue was completely truthful. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsuggesting that it was difficult for him to control; (3) that he remains in counseling for sex \naddiction; and (4) that he made multiple false statements to his employer and to the DoD, we are \nnot able to say that the Judge erred in her conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden \nof persuasion.  We note in particular the Directive\u2019s requirement that failure to provide full, frank \nand truthful answers during a clearance investigation \u201cwill normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination[.]\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 15. On the whole, \nApplicant\u2019s appeal arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not enough to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02304 at 2 (App. \nBd. Dec. 8, 2022).  \nWe have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s contentions on appeal and conclude that \nthe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings or analysis. The decision \nis sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. On January 12, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising \nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, \nas amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On May 30, 2023, after the record closed, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Ross D. Hyams denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for public trust eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 14 delinquent debts totaling about $85,000, including \nchild support arrearages of about $58,000. During the hearing, the SOR was amended to add an \nallegation in conformance with the record, alleging that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \nand state income tax returns for tax year 2021. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each \nof the allegations with explanations. The Judge found against Applicant on all but two student loan \ndebts. In general, the Judge concluded that Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his delinquent debts and failure to file his 2021 \nFederal and state income tax returns. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge: (1) erred by considering the \u201clate\u201d filing of his \n2021 tax returns because he believes they could have been filed anytime; (2) did not consider his \nprior security eligibility; (3) unfairly weighed his child support arrearage against his payment \nrecord; and (4) did not consider his record of appropriately handling sensitive information. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his late-30s, has been married three times, and has three minor children who \nlive with his first spouse. He served on active duty in the Unites States military from 2002 to 2012, \nand in the Reserve force from 2012 to 2016. He was honorably discharged from both periods of \nservice. He has worked in information technology for a government contractor since 2017. When \nApplicant first separated from his spouse in 2011, he signed an agreement against legal advice, \nwhere he agreed to pay $3,000 per month in child support and alimony. The support agreement \nwas incorporated into his final divorce decree, despite his concerns that he was financially \noverextended. Applicant paid his ex-spouse partial payments in cash when he was financially able. \nHe rarely made full payments on his support obligations. In 2017, his ex-spouse sought to enforce \nhis child support in another state. As a result, his monthly support obligations were reduced to \n$1,200 per month, but he was assessed an arrearage amount owed of about $122,000. The current \nchild-support arrearage balance is about $135,000. Although Applicant\u2019s paycheck had been \ngarnished since March 2020, his child-support arrearage has increased about $10,000 over three \nyears, and he did not document a track record of payments for earlier dates. \nThe Judge found that the remaining debts alleged in the SOR were unresolved except for \ntwo student loans. Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant failed to timely file his 2021 \nFederal and state income tax returns. Applicant stated that his spouse, who is a bookkeeper, told \nhim he could file his tax returns at any time. He submitted unsigned 2021 tax returns but did not \ndocument that the returns were filed. Finally, the Judge noted that Applicant has a history of \nfinancial problems that were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004, \nhad a home foreclosed in 2014, and a state tax lien for $1,800 filed against him in 2018. The Judge \nnoted that Applicant did not provide a current financial statement or evidence of credit counseling, \nbut Applicant did submit documentation of his work history and character letters. \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends the Judge erred by considering the \u201clate\u201d filing of his 2021 tax returns. \nHe contends that he could have filed them anytime, and that the emails between \u201cthe prosecution \nand defense\u201d resulted in the Judge stating that \u201cthe late filing would hold no bearing on the \noutcome of the case.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. In evaluating a case under Guideline F, a Judge should \nconsider the extent to which an applicant\u2019s circumstances cast doubt upon his judgment, self-\ncontrol, and other characteristics essential to protecting national security information. This \nobligation is rooted in the language of the Directive, which states that failure to meet financial \nobligations may indicate unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising questions \nabout an applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 18. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-01382 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant stated that he had not yet filed his 2021 income tax returns. \nTr. 70. When asked if he obtained an extension to file his 2021 tax returns late, he said, \nI did not. But my ex-wife who is basically an accountant said you could file taxes \nanytime. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- I mean I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s kind of true. You \ncan file taxes anytime. [Tr. 70.] \nWhen asked by the Judge if his ex-wife is an accountant, he said, \u201cshe\u2019s the payroll \nmanager for a construction company.\u201d Id. Applicant noted in his appeal that he has never filed \nfraudulent income tax returns and, \u201cthough [he] has filed taxes late,\u201d he always followed guidelines \nwhen filed. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, \nincluding, \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record shows that \nApplicant had not filed his 2021 income tax returns as of the hearing, and his post-hearing \nsubmission consisted of an unsigned and undated return for that tax year. Applicant\u2019s focus on the \n\u201cfraudulently filed\u201d language of AG \u00b6 19(f) on appeal is misplaced, as the disqualifying condition \nis also invoked by an individual\u2019s failure to file tax returns as required. Based on the record, the \nJudge appropriately held that the 2021 income tax returns were not timely filed. \nApplicant next claims that he was unable to argue that he has held security eligibility in the \npast, namely during his military service, and emphasizes his unblemished record of safeguarding \nsensitive information. The record does not support Applicant\u2019s contentions. Government Exhibit \n1 is Applicant\u2019s security clearance application where he noted his prior secret security clearances \ngranted in 2002 and 2012, and that he has never had security clearance eligibility denied, \nsuspended, or revoked. GE 1 at 41-43. The hearing transcript does not support Applicant\u2019s claim \nthat he was prevented from arguing his past security clearance record. None of his arguments are \nenough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence, including \nthat he has held a security clearance in the past. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01365 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2023). \nFinally, Applicant misstates that he was found untrustworthy based on a misapplication of \nhis history of child-support payments via garnishment or otherwise. Rather, the Judge found that \nApplicant has not sufficiently addressed his child-support arrearage and carries a growing \ndelinquency totaling about $135,000. The matters discussed above, along with the Judge\u2019s findings \nof unresolved debts not mentioned in Applicant\u2019s appeal, sufficiently support the Judge\u2019s overall \nfinding against his eligibility for a public trust position. To the extent that Applicant is contending \nthe Judge mis-weighed the evidence, we find no merit in those assertions.  None of his arguments \nare enough to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Id. The remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief consists of an \nexplanation of his efforts to resolve his debts. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2018). A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). The Appeal Board has noted that in evaluating Guideline F cases, the concept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety o",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nDaniel Conway, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 4, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline \nH (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On May 9, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline F, six delinquent debts totaling approximately $74,000, \nand, under Guidelines H and J, two criminal charges to which Applicant pleaded guilty: possession \nof a controlled substance (Oxycodone) in 2016, and felony importation of cocaine in 2017. The \nJudge found in favor of Applicant on four small debts and the Guideline H allegations, and against \nApplicant on two large debts totaling about $72,700, and on the criminal conduct. On appeal, \nApplicant asserts new evidence in the form of recent partial payments on the two large debts in \nquestion, and a letter signed by Applicant\u2019s former attorney and a United States Magistrate Judge \nwho were involved with Applicant\u2019s criminal charges, explaining the Veterans Treatment Court \nand arguing Applicant\u2019s worthiness for a security clearance.

For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his 30s and employed by a Federal contractor. He previously served \nhonorably in the military. In July 2016, he was charged with possession of a controlled substance \n(Oxycodone). In October 2017, he was charged with felony importation of cocaine. In the first \ncase, Applicant was cited for possession of Oxycodone when he returned from Mexico to the \nUnited States after filling a U.S. prescription for the drug in Mexico. He told a government \ninvestigator that he went to the appropriate court and was told by the clerk that no action had been \ntaken on his citation, and he would be contacted at a later date. He also said he assumed the sheriff\u2019s \noffice chose not to pursue the charge since no record could be found. He did not follow up on the \ncitation. In testimony, he said he went to Mexico for dental work, and returned with the \nOxycodone. He presented an older bottle to a border agent, not a newly filled prescription, and \nwas cited for misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. He then said he went to the wrong \ncourthouse to address the citation and the hearing was rescheduled. He claimed in testimony that \nafter the hearing was rescheduled, he was given a new date to appear, but he failed to do so because \nhe was incarcerated. \nIn October 2017, Applicant claimed to a government investigator that he went to Mexico \nto obtain vaccines for his dogs, had left his rental car unattended for three hours, and returned to \nthe United States. His vehicle was searched at the border and 16 kilos of cocaine were found inside \nthe spare tire. Applicant was arrested and charged with felony importation of cocaine. He denied \nthe drugs belonged to him and denied knowledge of it being in his vehicle. Applicant entered a \nguilty plea to felony importation of cocaine. He told a government investigator that he pled guilty \nto fast track his case and to allow him to qualify for Veterans Court. He said he would have been \nconvicted of the charge had he gone to trial. He participated in a 90-day residential Community \nResource and Self-Help Program (CRASH) after his incarceration, a prerequisite to participating \nin Veterans Court. \nApplicant violated a CRASH program restriction and was returned to federal prison from \nOctober 2018 to April 2019. In April 2019, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea so he \ncould participate in Veterans Court. As part of his agreement to allow him to withdraw his plea \nand participate in Veterans Court, he had to plead guilty to the importation of cocaine charge. He \nalso learned that he had an outstanding charge for possession of a controlled substance from 2016 \nand a warrant for his failure to appear in court. Applicant said the state agreed to resolve the \npossession citation while he was a participant in the Veterans Court. However, the charge was \nadjudicated through a diversion program in a different court. Applicant completed the program, \nand the misdemeanor charge was dismissed in January 2021. The Veterans Court required that \nApplicant plead guilty to the charge and complete various requirements, and in three years, he \ncould request to have the charge expunged. Applicant completed all of the requirements of the \nprogram in July 2020. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $74,000. Applicant \ntestified that his debts were incurred during his marriage and that he lost track of the smaller ones \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndue to life events. The two larger debts for which the Judge found against Applicant became \ndelinquent in 2017. In his security clearance application (SCA), he attributed the smaller of the \ntwo debts (SOR \u00b6 1.b for about $14,920) to a divorce and the end of a contract that he had been \nworking on, and that he planned to contact the creditor to resolve them once he was back to work. \nIn his November 2019 interview, he said he underestimated the amount of his credit-card debt and \nattributed it to loss of a contract and because he was unemployed while incarcerated in October \n2017 for his drug charge. He also explained that the larger of the two debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a for about \n$57,790) resulted from a loan to purchase a travel trailer for which he was unable to pay for the \nsame reasons. He told the investigator that he contacted the creditor and planned to make payments \nbecause he started a new job and would pay once he knew he would keep the job. He said the four \nremaining debts (for which the Judge found for Applicant) were paid after he received the SOR. \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR in February 2021, he said he was working on repaying \nthe two debts in question (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He delayed resolving the debts because of a costly \nchild custody dispute. At the hearing, he provided letters dated February 14, 2023, from the \ncreditor confirming settlement offers of $26,006 for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and $6,696 for \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The creditor agreed to accept monthly payments of $650 and $270, \nrespectively, for 40 months until June 2026. Applicant provided copies of payments made in \nFebruary and March 2023. \nThe Judge found that Applicant began accumulating delinquent debt in 2017. He paid the \nsmall debts in 2021, after he received the SOR. However, despite promises to address the two large \ndebts, he failed to act on them until \u201cdays before his hearing.\u201d Decision at 9. The Judge said that \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was primarily due to his incarceration after being charged with a \nserious drug offense, a matter that was not beyond his control, while the other reasons attributed \nto his delinquent debts were beyond his control. The Judge found that mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply because some of the debts are ongoing and unpaid, and that Applicant did not \nact responsibly under the circumstances. The Judge found that AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application, \nand that there was no evidence of financial counseling as contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(c), but that \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applied to the four small delinquent debts that were paid. The Judge found in favor of \nApplicant on the four small debts, but against him on the two larger debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline H allegations, but against him on \nthe cross-alleged criminal conduct described as two drug charges in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The Judge \nfound that the misdemeanor offense of possession of a controlled substance (Oxycodone) was \nadjudicated through a diversion program and was dismissed. She also found that the felony charge \nfor importation of cocaine was adjudicated in Veterans Court and dismissed with prejudice after \nApplicant completed the Court\u2019s requirements. The Judge held that Applicant\u2019s past criminal \nconduct was serious and did not occur under unique circumstances. She held that both criminal \ncharges were dismissed through the benefit of the Veterans Court program, not because they did \nnot occur. Applicant pleaded guilty to both charges and the Judge found that his serious criminal \nconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, despite the mitigation \napplied for completing the Veterans Court program and current employment.

He argues that \u201c[p]ayments \nbegan more than several days prior to hearing,\u201d specifically, \u201cgood faith was initiated in January \n2023 with first payment made on 1 February 2023.\u201d Id. He also argues that the Judge \u201cabused her \ndiscretion by failing to apply mitigating conditions that the circumstances are unlikely to recur and \nhappened some time ago.\u201d Id. \nThe Judge noted in her findings of fact that Applicant negotiated settlements of the two \nlarge debts and made required payments in February and March 2023. The record shows that these \npayments were made one month before the hearing, and on the day of the hearing. Applicant \nExhibit E, F. An applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2018). A \ndebt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). \nThe Appeal Board has noted that in evaluating Guideline F cases, the concept of \n\u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment \nof debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he \nhas established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. \nBd. May 21, 2008). See also AG \u00b6 2(a) (\u201cAll available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a national security \neligibility determination.\u201d). \nThe Judge also found that relevant mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and J were \nnot sufficient to meet Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence is not enough to show that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

On \nNovember 23, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On May 10, \n2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Carol \nG. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has 13 delinquent debts: a Department \nof Defense debt of about $26,000, ten Department of Education student loans totaling about \n$63,000, a Department of Veterans Affairs debt of about $1,400, and child support arrearages of \nabout $4,200. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the Guideline F allegations, \nsome with comments. Under Guideline E, it alleged that Applicant falsified two security clearance \napplications (SCAs) by failing to disclose that he had delinquent debts.

The Judge concluded that Applicant deliberately falsified his \nSCAs. The Judge found against Applicant on each of the SOR allegations but excepted specific \ndebts from the falsification allegations. In general, she concluded that Applicant failed to present \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from the SOR allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge \u201cwas very rude and insulting. She would ask me \na question and would cut me off when I try [sic] to answer. She also called me a thief during the \nhearing.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We construe this assertion as a claim that the Judge was biased \nagainst him and that he was denied due process. This assignment of error is unpersuasive. There \nis a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome \nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. \nBd. Aug. 7, 2018). We examined the entire record and Decision, paying particular attention to the \ntranscript of the hearing. We find nothing therein that would cause a reasonable person to question \nthe Judge\u2019s impartiality in this case. The Judge\u2019s comments and questions, while pointed and \ndirect, appear to be efforts at hearing administration and to clarify Applicant\u2019s testimony. Id. \n(quoting Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540 at 555-556 (1994)) (\u201c\u2018[E]xpressions of impatience, \ndissatisfaction, annoyance, even anger\u2019 do not establish bias. \u2018A judge\u2019s ordinary effort at \ncourtroom administration\u2015even a stern and short-tempered judge\u2019s ordinary efforts at courtroom \nadministration\u2015remain immune\u2019.\u201d). Applicant has neither rebutted the presumption that the \nJudge was unbiased nor established that he was denied any due process afforded him under the \nDirective. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief consists of an explanation of his efforts to \nresolve the alleged debts. He does not specifically assert the Judge committed any error. To the \nextent that he is contending the Judge mis-weighed or did not consider record evidence, we find \nno merit in those assertions.   None of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in \na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). Applicant also asserts that he has lost a job due to the denial of his \nsecurity clearance. The adverse impact of an unfavorable security clearance decision, however, is \nnot a relevant consideration in evaluating clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02397 \nat 1-2 (App. Bd. May 6, 2020).  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

In July 2015, Applicant \nwas ordered to pay retroactive and ongoing child support of about $840 per month but, in \ncalculating the arrearage owed, the court gave him no credit for the informal support previously \npaid. Payments were thereafter made by income withholding consistent with that court order and \nthe remaining arrearage was approximately $12,300 as of the hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nApplicant\u2019s second child was born in 2006 and a child support order was entered in July \n2007, under which Applicant was required to pay retroactive and ongoing monthly child support \nof about $300. Payments for this obligation were also made by income withholding and, as of the \nhearing, the remaining arrearage was approximately $6,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s third child was born in 2013 and he paid informal child support for a \ntime. In April 2019, Applicant was court-ordered to pay about $770 for retroactive and ongoing \nmonthly support, again via income withholding, and the remaining arrearage as of the hearing was \napproximately $33,049 following compliant payments (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nAs of the hearing, Applicant had reduced his cumulative arrearage by at least $14,000 since \nthe SOR was issued, a period of about 17 months, and the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s most recent \ncredit report reflected \u201can improved financial situation, and the three child support accounts were \nthe only past-due accounts listed.\u201d Decision at 4. In concluding that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully applied, the Judge noted that the child support arrearages were \u201cbeing paid by \ninvoluntary payroll deductions pursuant to court order or tax refund interception, which are not \nthe equivalent of good-faith payments.\u201d Decision at 7. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant provides new evidence in the form of narrative updates regarding the \nstatus of the three child support debts. The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new \nevidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to \nmatters in which the appealing party has alleged that the Judge committed harmful error. To that \nend, Applicant also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s assessment that his child support payments are \nbeing involuntarily withheld. Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider that his child \nsupport obligation is being paid through income withholding pursuant to the Florida Statutes, and \nthe Judge therefore mischaracterized the payments as involuntary. This argument has merit and \nwarrants review on appeal. \nIn deciding whether a judge\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Appeal Board \nwill review the decision to determine whether: it fails to examine relevant evidence; fails to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; fails to consider relevant factors; reflects a clear error of \njudgment; fails to consider an important aspect of the case; offers an explanation for the decision \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere \ndifference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 95-0600 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle \nMfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nApplicant\u2019s child support arrearage, which constituted the bulk of his outstanding debt and \nthe Judge\u2019s adverse formal findings, is being paid via income withholding orders (IWO). See, e.g., \nApplicant Exhibit A. Reviewing the decision in this case requires addressing two common \nmisconceptions regarding child support. First, a child support arrearage does not necessarily \nequate to a child support delinquency. An arrearage may be assessed due to missed or incomplete \npayments owed pursuant to an existing child support order, which indicates delinquency by the \nobligor. An arrearage may also result from entry of an initial order that calculates support \nretroactively. Whether such a retroactive calculation constitutes a delinquency, and the security \nsignificance thereof, depends on the circumstances of the case. In the present case, the record \nreflects that all three of Applicant\u2019s arrearages resulted when initial orders were entered that \ncalculated both current and retroactive child support. \nSecond, a child support IWO does not necessarily carry the same negative implications as \nother forms of involuntary payment. In his decision, the Judge correctly noted that the Appeal \nBoard has long held that reliance on garnishment or other involuntary means of debt resolution \ndoes not equate to a good-faith repayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Child support IWOs, however, are not per se equivalent to garnishment \norders. Although both operate via court-enforced deduction from an individual\u2019s assets, IWOs \nhave nuances that render them distinguishable from garnishments and potentially excepted from \nAppeal Board precedent regarding involuntary payments. \nWhile the automatic and court-enforced nature of IWOs means payments are not made \nstrictly \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d they are not necessarily punitive or entered because of prior or forecasted \ndelinquencies. Rather, \u201cimmediate income withholding\u201d \u2013 the Federally mandated default method \nfor paying child support in every State \u2013 requires, with exceptions, entry of an IWO whenever an \ninitial child support order is entered.1 It is imposed regardless of an obligor\u2019s history of payment \ncompliance, simply to ensure child welfare.2 Moreover, immediate income withholding, by \ndefinition, cannot represent a prior failure to pay because it is immediate \u2013 meaning the IWO is \nentered concurrent with the child support determination, before delinquencies can have occurred. \nAs stated above and relevant to the facts of this case, an arrearage may be calculated based on a \nretroactive child support award, but that is not the same as a balance that accrued due to intentional \n1 See 42 U.S.C. 666(a)(8)(B) and (b). The requirement is codified in Applicant\u2019s State in the Florida Statutes. See FLA. \nSTAT. \u00a7 61.1301(1)(a) (2009) (requiring entry of an IWO in cases establishing, enforcing, or modifying a child support \nobligation). \n2 Immediate income withholding was introduced by The Family Support Act (FSA) of 1988. Unlike the delinquency-\nbased income withholding introduced in prior FSA amendments, the 1988 amendments required states to implement \nimmediate income withholding in all child support orders issued beginning January 1, 1994, with exceptions for good \ncause or alternate arrangements agreed upon in writing by both parents and the court.

Additionally, Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect \nthat the cumulative balance of his three child support accounts was approximately $68,000 as of \nMarch 2019 (GE 3 at 3) and was reduced to approximately $51,000 as of May 2022 (GE 5 at 4), a \n$17,000 reduction over those three years alone. A good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve \ndebts requires a meaningful and evidenced track record of debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). While Applicant was required to pay his monthly child \nsupport obligation by IWO and therefore his payments were arguably not voluntary, there is no \nquestion that the payments were made consistently over many years and therefore amount to a \nmeaningful track record of debt reduction. It is unclear what more Applicant should have done in \nthis case to demonstrate good faith repayment sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nstemming from his child support arrearages. \nFinally, Applicant resubmits with his appeal evidence showing that he contacted the \ncollection agency responsible for the account alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d, a consumer debt charged off \nfor approximately $1,000, and the agency was unable to locate the account. This information was \nincluded in the record below and the Judge found that it was insufficient to establish that the debt \nwas resolved. In consideration of the discussion about Applicant\u2019s child support accounts, above, \nthis relatively minor debt is the single remaining SOR allegation not fully or in the process of being \nresolved. Applicant was not required to establish that he had completely paid off his indebtedness. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). The totality of the record supports \nthat Applicant addressed his debts responsibly and that his financial problems are under control \nand no longer present security concerns. \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider \nthe foregoing important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the record evidence. \n3 Conversely, when income withholding is instituted after entry of a support order where alternative payment \narrangements were attempted first, it is more likely to represent a remedy to protect against further delinquencies. That \nis not the case here. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F.

On \nApril 30, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A \nof Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the \nwritten record. On June 15, 2023, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Philip J. \nKatauskas granted Applicant security clearance eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Government does not challenge the Judge\u2019s favorable Guideline B findings. Those \nfindings are not addressed below. On appeal, the Government raises the following issues: \nwhether the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline F mitigating conditions and his whole-person \nanalysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

These were entered in 2009, 2013, and 2014. \nApplicant and her husband have seven children. She and her husband now live apart from \neach other and have almost no contact. In the early 2000s, her husband was doing well financially \nand providing her support. By the mid-2000s, he encountered financial difficulties. Around that \ntime, she was unemployed. With her children then being between the ages of five and fifteen, she \nfell behind on paying bills and eventually stopped making payments. At present, she does not \nhave the financial ability to pay the delinquent debts. \nHer primary financial sources are \ngovernment assistance for her mother\u2019s care, support from her children, and income from two part-\ntime jobs. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report does not list the three alleged judgments. It lists only four \naccounts that are reported as current. Applicant disclosed the three judgments in her 2019 security \nclearance application (SCA), and also disclosed an unalleged state tax delinquency of about \n$22,900 for 2016 and 2017 for which she has an agreement to make monthly payments of $800. \nThe evidence established that Applicant has an inability to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and \na history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b619(c)). However, those security concerns are \nmitigated because they arose from an unforeseen chain of circumstances that happened years ago, \nand she has acted in a financially responsible manner. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). \nHaving admitted the SOR allegations pertaining to the three judgments, Applicant had the burden \nof producing evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from those debts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. She also had the burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable decision. Id. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion.

These assertions \nof error are persuasive. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) \nWe agree with the Judge that the age of the alleged debts and the fact that the only credit \nreport in the record does not reflect that Applicant has any delinquent debts were important matters \nto consider. \nHowever, the unalleged tax debt was also a significant matter that merited \nconsideration in evaluating the mitigating evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017) (it is well established that a Judge may consider unfavorable non-alleged \nmatters for certain limited purposes, such as in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation \nand in applying the whole-person concept). \nThe evidence regarding the unalleged property tax debt is somewhat unusual. In her 2019 \nSCA, Applicant disclosed that she has resided at the same location since early 2008. \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Item 2 at 11-12. This is also the location where \nher mother, five of her children, and one of her sisters reside. Id. at 22-28 and 32. She further \ndisclosed that she owed about $22,954 in delinquent taxes to the county treasurer for 2016 and \n2017 and that she pays $800 each month on that debt. Id. at 55. In her FORM Response, \nApplicant indicated that she had paid $25,000 towards this property tax debt, and she is still making \npayments. As supporting evidence, she provided a tax receipt from the county treasurer. FORM \nResponse at 6. This document acknowledges that $25,000 in taxes was paid on this property for \n2019 and 2020. However, the tax receipt is addressed to a third party. The name on that \ndocument is neither Applicant\u2019s, her mother\u2019s, any of her children\u2019s, nor her sister\u2019s. The \nrelationship between Applicant and that third party is unknown. Nevertheless, from her SCA and \nFORM Response, Applicant is clearly accepting responsibility for the delinquent property taxes. \nThe tax receipt also reflects ongoing property tax delinquencies. It indicates that over \n$6,000 is owed for 2018, over $600 remains outstanding for 2020, and over $10,000 is due for \n2021. This document was created in May 2022 and reflects no payments have been made towards \nthe 2021 property taxes. The Judge failed to address this evidence, which undercuts his analysis \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). This evidence raises concerns about whether Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare under control or are unlikely to recur. It also casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nAG \u00b6 20(b) \nIn applying this mitigating condition, the Judge basically concluded that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. The record, however, contains no evidence of Applicant \nmaking any payments towards the alleged judgments or of her taking any action to resolve these \ndebts. The Judge does not explain the basis for his conclusion that Applicant \u201cbehaved in a \nfinancially responsible manner.\u201d Decision at 8. \nPresumably, the Judge reached this conclusion because Applicant could not afford to make \nany payments on the alleged debts. Only two statements in the record support such a financial \ninability. These are: \n(1) In her 2019 SCA, Applicant stated, \u201cI could not make a payment arrangement \n[regarding each of the judgments] due to my fallback of payment\u201d or words to that effect. FORM, \nItem 2 at 55-57. \n(2) During her background interview, Applicant reportedly stated that she \u201cdoes not have \nthe money to pay these creditors at this time.\u201d FORM, Item 3 at 7. \nThe record, however, does not contain any statements from Applicant about her income, expenses, \nor net monthly remainder. Furthermore, the record is devoid of any evidence to corroborate her \ninability to make payments on the alleged debts. It does not contain any income tax transcripts \nor monthly pay stubs. Nor does it contain a budget or similar information. \nLittle is known about Applicant\u2019s assets, but what evidence exists regarding her financial \nmeans is noteworthy. First, in the Foreign Financial Interests Real Estate Section of her 2019 \nSCA, Applicant disclosed that she and her husband owned an apartment in a Middle Eastern \ncountry. They sold it for about $200,000 in early 2013. Her husband asked that they give the \nproceeds of the sale to their daughter. FORM, Item 2 at 42-43 and 55-56. This sale occurred \nafter one of the alleged judgments was entered against her and during the same month in which \nanother judgment was entered. Second, during her background interview, Applicant stated that \nher \u201chusband was a very successful businessman\u201d in a foreign country. FORM, Item 3 at 5. He \nis the plaintiff in a pending $14 million lawsuit. Id. She stated, \u201cI am keeping my Bank account \nopen in Belgium in case my husband gets his money it will be transferred to my account only and \nnot to invest the money in Belgium. When this happen (sic), the money will be invested in the \nUS.\u201d FORM Response at 1 and 6. Third, Applicant also indicated that she paid over $25,000 in \nproperty taxes for 2019 and 2020, which tends to show that her residence is substantial. Id. \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s SCA reflects that she traveled to a Middle Eastern country from about March \n2010 to January 2011 to visit family or friends and that that she traveled to that same country from \nabout March 2013 to August 2014 for the same reason. She also twice traveled to a country \nneighboring the United States for shorter periods (1-5 days and 11-20 days) to visit family and \nfriends in 2017 and 2018. FORM, Item 2 at 47-50. Each of these foreign trips occurred while \none or more of the alleged debts was delinquent.

Based on our review, we conclude the record contains insufficient \nevidence to support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nConclusion \nConsidering the record in its entirety, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary \nand capricious. It is not sustainable because it fails to consider important aspects of the case, fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for a key conclusion, and runs contrary to the weight of the \nrecord evidence.

Applicant requested a hearing. On \nNovember 10, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He holds a master\u2019s degree \nand works for a defense contractor. He was previously employed by another defense contractor \nfrom 2003 until 2011 and was granted a security clearance in the early 2000s. \nApplicant committed various acts of misconduct during the course of his previous \nemployment. He viewed pornography on his employer\u2019s computer on about a dozen occasions \nand masturbated in his office about five times. He disclosed this conduct in connection with a \n2009 polygraph examination and signed a statement acknowledging that such conduct was against \nGovernment policy. \nApplicant left the defense industry in 2011, returning in 2013 when he began working for \nhis current employer. He underwent another polygraph examination in 2014, disclosing to \ninterviewers that he had viewed pornography at work during the course of his new job, though on \nhis cell phone. He admitted to additional misconduct at his previous job\u2e3aloading a private \ncompact disc onto his corporate computer and using a personal USB drive to transfer proprietary \ntext files. In addition, he disclosed that he had transferred proprietary information between late \n2013 and early 2014. He stated that during his earlier investigation he had deliberately withheld \ninformation about his use of personal USB drives. Applicant admitted knowing that his conduct \nduring the course of both jobs was prohibited by Government as well as by company policy. In \nthe course of the 2014 polygraph examination, Applicant admitted that he had not taken his 2009 \nsigned statement seriously. \nIn 2015, the Government revoked Applicant\u2019s access to classified information and \ndisapproved additional access that he had been seeking in connection with his employment. \nApplicant has received regular briefings on security matters since beginning his employment in \nthe defense industry. \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation as to his character and \ntrustworthiness, and his performance evaluations are excellent. Applicant has attended counseling \nsessions in order to resolve his addiction. \nIn the analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s having engaged in \nsignificant misconduct during the course of two different jobs, his behavior during his second job \noccurring despite his having signed a statement acknowledging that such behavior was forbidden.  \nShe stated that Applicant had disclosed his conduct during the course of polygraph examinations, \nwhich diminished the weight to which his disclosures were entitled.  Though she noted the length \nof time that had elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last alleged infraction, she concluded that, under the \ncircumstances of the case, his conduct continues to impugn his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.1 \n1 \u201cIt is recognized that Applicant has not engaged in this misconduct for almost ten years, however, given his long \nhistory of misconduct, his relapses in sexual misconduct due to his addiction, and the fact that if it were not for the \npolygraph examinations this information may not have been disclosed, there remains uncertainty and concern about \nhis credibility. . . . Under the particular circumstances here, the before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished and have not been mitigated.\u201d Decision at 9\u201310. \n2 \n\n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of his security concerns was faulty. Among \nother things, he contends that it was merely conclusory and that it failed to address significant \nevidence, for example his counseling, his admissions to his spouse, church officials, counselor, \nand others, and the length of time that had elapsed since his last instance of security-significant \nconduct. We have considered Applicant\u2019s brief in light of Judge\u2019s Decision and the record \nevidence as a whole. Regarding Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge did not provide sufficient \nanalysis of his security concerns, we note that a Judge is required to: \nmake a written clearance decision . . . setting forth pertinent findings of fact, \npolicies, and conclusions as to the allegations in the SOR, and whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \napplicant.  Directive \u204b E3.1.25. \nA Judge\u2019s decision is not held to an absolute standard of perfection, and in any event the Directive \ndoes not specify a required quantum of analysis. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-03578 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 4, 2012); ISCR Case No. 15-06050 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2017). The Judge made \nextensive findings supported by the record evidence, cited to appropriate disqualifying and \nmitigation conditions, and clearly set forth conclusions pertinent to the question of whether the \ncontinuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance was in the national interest. We conclude that the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis satisfies the requirements of the Directive. \nApplicant argues that the Judge should have given greater weight to evidence that he \nadmitted his misconduct to his wife and to others. He also contends that he was forthcoming with \nthe Government in that he could simply have refused to answer questions about his misconduct in \ninterviews following polygraph examinations. While Applicant\u2019s admissions to persons outside \nhis place of employment was evidence the Judge was bound to consider, along with all the other \nevidence in the record, Applicant had an affirmative duty to disclose security-significant conduct \nto his employer. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08163 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2017) (\u201cAn applicant \nmust be willing to self-report significant information pertinent to his or her clearance.\u201d). That \nApplicant disclosed his conduct only during interviews connected with polygraph examinations \ndiminishes the weight to which his disclosure might otherwise be entitled. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02554 at 6-7 (App. Bd. June 23, 2022) (Admission of security-significant conduct \nfollowing polygraph examination is a factor to consider in determining whether an applicant \nsatisfied the requirement of full disclosure.). All in all, we find no reason to disturb either the \nJudge\u2019s comment that, but for the polygraph examinations, security officials may never have \nlearned about Applicant\u2019s behavior or the weight which she gave to the circumstances of his \ndisclosures. \nApplicant contends that the Judge engaged in \u201cminor quibbles over semantics insufficient \nto undermine [Applicant\u2019s] veracity.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. To the extent that this is a challenge to \nthe Judge\u2019s assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, we note that the Directive requires us to give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.

See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 12-01578 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2014). For example, he contends that the Judge \ndid not extend appropriate weight to evidence that he attended counseling sessions and that his \ncounselor opined that he is committed to ensuring that his sexual misconduct does not continue. \nThe Judge made a finding about this matter. However, given the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity significant conduct we find no reason to believe that the Judge mis-weighed this evidence. \nIndeed, the Judge\u2019s findings and the record evidence established the following: (1) Applicant \nrepeatedly used previous employer\u2019s computer to view pornography and masturbated, while on \nthe job; (2) Applicant transferred company files to his personal computer in violation of company \npolicy;  (3) Following an investigation, Applicant signed a document in 2009 acknowledging that \nsuch conduct was not consistent with Government or company policy; (4) Applicant subsequently \nengaged in similar behavior during the course of employment by a second Defense contractor, \nthough he viewed pornography on his personal cell phone; (5) Applicant knew that his conduct \nwas not permitted, stating that he did not take the 2009 document that he signed seriously; (6) \nApplicant stated that he had withheld information during the investigation of his misconduct \nduring his previous employment; (7) Applicant disclosed his conduct to security officials only \nafter he had taken polygraph examinations; and (8) Though the last instance of misconduct alleged \nin the SOR occurred in 2014, Applicant testified that he viewed pornography at work in \u201ceither \n2017 or 2018.\u201d Tr. at 51. The Judge did not make a finding about this testimony. However, it is \nconsistent with her ultimate conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt upon his \njudgment. We have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments. He has not rebutted \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that \nthe Judge mis-weighed the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. \n15, 2020).  \nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as \nto the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors. The decision is sustainable on this \nrecord. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n2 Government Exhibit (GE) 2 is a set of interrogatories that includes a summary of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview. \nApplicant certified that the interview accurately reflected the information he provided during the interview, stating \u201cI \ndo not have any additional information to add on these matters.\u201d He signed the affidavit, swearing that the information \ncontained therein was true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. GE 2 at 2-4. Applicant did not object \nto the admission of this exhibit at the hearing. Tr. at 9-10. During the hearing, however, Applicant testified that GE \n2 contained statements that he did not believe were true and that in signing the affidavit he was merely swearing that \nhe had read it in an effort to be cooperative with the investigation. Tr. at 55. These statements are not consistent with \none another, and inconsistent statements can impugn a witness\u2019s credibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

The \nJudge found against Applicant on each of the SOR allegations. For reason stated below, we \nremand the Judge\u2019s decision for corrective action. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans arose from his attendance at ITT Technical Institute (ITT) \nbetween 2009 and 2013, from which he was awarded associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees. In the \ndecision, the Judge noted that Applicant supplied a letter from DoE stating that collection activity \non his student loans was suspended pending further review. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant stated his student loans would either be forgiven or he would begin a repayment plan as \nsoon as possible to bring those loans into good standing. The Judge concluded that those loans \nremained unresolved. \nIn ISCR Case No. 21-01688 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2023), the Appeal Board recently addressed \nthe issue of a Judge taking administrative notice, sua sponte, of DoE\u2019s action to discharge ITT \nstudent loans. In that decision, we took administrative notice of a DoE press release of August 16, \n2022. \nSee https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-39-billion\u00ad\ngroup-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical-institute. We again take admin\u00ad\nistrative notice of that press release, in which the Secretary of Education is quoted as saying: \nIt is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from ITT\u2019s years of \nlies and false promises[.] . . . The evidence shows that for years, ITT\u2019s leaders \nintentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to profit \noff federal student loan programs with no regard for the hardship this would cause. \n[Appeal Board Exhibit 1.] \nThe Judge\u2019s decision is remanded so that he may determine the impact of DOE\u2019s action and the \nrationale for said action on Applicant\u2019s student loans, which make up most of the alleged debt.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant provides new evidence, including a DoE document indicating \nthat his student loan balance was $32,238 as of January 2, 2023, and that those loans are in \nforbearance.  Applicant also presents new evidence regarding other alleged debts.  \nIn his reply brief, Department Counsel argues that the discharge, non-collectability, or \nunenforceability of a debt does not necessarily eliminate \u201cconcerns over an applicant\u2019s poor \njudgment as evidenced by the manner in which an applicant accumulated and addressed [the] \ndebt.\u201d  Reply Brief at 5.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPatrick J. Hughes, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 1, 2021, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the \nwritten record. On April 29, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) provided \nApplicant the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) and afforded him an opportunity \nto file objections or submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM. On December 1, 2022, the Government made a correction to the \nFORM, and Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. \nLynch afforded Applicant an additional 30 days to respond. Applicant submitted no response to \nthe amended FORM. On January 17, 2023, after considering the record, the Judge denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the debts with \nexplanation. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the student loan accounts2 and against him \non the remaining six allegations, which totaled approximately $15,100. On appeal, Applicant \nasserts that the Judge failed to examine relevant evidence and failed to properly apply the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his late 40s. He attended a technical institute off-and-on from September \n2010 to March 2015; however, the institute closed before he received a diploma. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer since 2019. \nWith respect to the six consumer, medical, and lease debts, the Judge found that Applicant \nstated he was not aware of or not liable for the accounts and was disputing them or that they had \nbeen removed from his credit report. Decision at 2-3. The Judge specifically identified four \nMitigating Conditions (MCs) as being potentially applicable, including MCs 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), \nand 20(d), but found that Applicant \u201cdid not attribute his financial problems to a singular incident \nor a period of time that caused the financial hardship\u201d and \u201cgave no insight into the reasons for his \naccumulation of debt.\u201d Decision at 5. Additionally, he had not participated in credit counseling or \nestablished that the financial problems were under control or being resolved. Id. The Judge \nconcluded that Applicant \u201cdisputed many debts and relied on the fact that some have fallen off his \ncredit report,\u201d and that there was insufficient evidence to establish mitigation. Decision at 6. \nDiscussion \nFailure to Examine Relevant Evidence and Mitigating Condition 20(e) \nOn appeal, Applicant first contends that the Judge erred by failing to consider his successful \ndispute of four of the alleged debts \u2013 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m \u2013 appearing on his credit report \nand \u201cwholly overlooked the reasonable explanations that [he] provided for the debts.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 3. Applicant also maintains that the Judge failed to properly analyze those four debts under MC \n20(e). Appeal Brief at 4. Because these positions are based on the same facts and underlying \nargument, we examine them together. \n1 The Decision incorrectly identifies the total dollar amount as approximately $41,500. \n2 We note that the Judge erred in her formal findings regarding student loan debts. As written, the formal findings \nreflect that the Judge found both for and against Applicant on five of the seven delinquent student loan allegations. \nApplicant provided a Department of Education letter reflecting these debts were discharged. FORM Item 2 at 3. In \nthe Decision, the Judge found that Applicant stated that he was relieved of the obligation to pay these loans and that \nthey were removed from his credit report. She specifically found, \u201cThis is the result of a scandal and closure of the \ninstitute that Applicant attended. I find for Applicant on these accounts.\u201d Decision at 2. A fair reading of the Decision \nreflects that the Judge made a typographical error in her formal findings by finding both for and against Applicant on \nfive of the student loans, and that she intended to find in his favor on the student loan debts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs an initial matter, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s failure to specifically analyze the \nfacts of this case under MC 20(e) was harmful error. A Judge, however, \u201cis not required explicitly \nto discuss all of the potentially applicable analytical factors set forth in the Directive, which \nincludes the disqualifying conditions, mitigating conditions, and whole-person factors.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 12-05512 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2017) (citation omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 99\u00ad\n0554 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2000) (\u201c[T]here is no requirement that a Judge must expressly cite or \nexplicitly quote every single provision of the Directive that is applicable or pertinent in a case.\u201d). \nTurning to the condition itself, the record evidence is insufficient to invoke MC 20(e). The \ncondition requires that an \u201cindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. \nA \u00b6 20(e) (emphasis added). Applicant\u2019s argument is that MC 20(e) applied because his general \ndenial of knowledge or liability for the debts constitutes a \u201creasonable explanation\u201d and his \ndisputing the debts with a credit reporting agency amounts to \u201caction to resolve the issue.\u201d We \ndisagree. \nHere, the basis of the disputes is that Applicant does not recognize the alleged debts or \nbelieves another party is liable. With respect to the first evidentiary option provided by MC 20(e), \nApplicant offered no documentation to substantiate his purported lack of recognition of the debts \nor his denial of their liability. Turning to MC 20(e)\u2019s second evidentiary option, the only evidence \nthat Applicant provided regarding action taken to resolve the issue was his assertion that he \ndisputed the debts on his credit report and his conclusion that the debts were subsequently removed \nbecause of his dispute. It is well settled that the absence of a debt on a credit report is not evidence \nof any particular disposition. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015) \n(\u201cThe fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, \nindependent evidence as to the disposition of the debt.\u201d). Rather, there are other reasons that a debt \nmay have been removed from a credit report, including the passage of time. Applicant contends \nthat his disputed debts were removed from his credit report due to successful disputes, but he \nprovided no evidence to corroborate that causation. MC 20(e) requires more than an individual\u2019s \nclaim to not recognize a debt coupled with a claim that he disputed the debt on his credit report. \nFailure to Properly Apply MC 20(c) and the Whole-Person Concept \nApplicant also argues that the Judge failed to properly consider MC 20(c) and the whole-\nperson factors. For example, he contends that the Judge misapplied MC 20(c) when she found that \nApplicant had not received financial counseling, did not provide a written budget, and was not \nestablishing a repayment plan or working with creditors to lessen the debt. Appeal Brief at 4. \nApplicant contends that, to the contrary, he had made payments towards debts not listed in the \nSOR, which constituted \u201ca reasonable plan and a good faith effort to repay the debt.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 5. This and the balance of Applicant\u2019s brief, including his argument that the Judge failed to give \nadequate weight to the Whole-Person Concept, amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).

These comments summarize Applicant\u2019s \nanswers to the interviewer; they do not constitute the interviewer\u2019s opinion about Applicant\u2019s \nclearance worthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-09595 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2012). In this case, \nthe Judge considered the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision. We find no error in her \nmitigation and whole-person analysis. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of \nthis case or in her decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for her decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Duffy \nThe Judge found against Applicant on six debts totaling about $15,100. In his appeal brief, \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to analyze under MC 20(e) four of those \nremaining debts, which total over $11,000. Applicant\u2019s contention has merit.  \nApplicant disputed the following debts: \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 an apartment complex account of about $11,000 that was placed for \ncollection. In his Personal Subject Interview, Applicant reportedly stated that he was unaware of \nthis account, claimed he never resided at the apartment complex, and indicated he was currently \ndisputing this account with the collection agencies. In responding to the SOR, Applicant stated he \nhad been disputing this debt for a while and noted \u201c[i]t is now off my credit report.\u201d This debt is \nnot listed on the credit report that Applicant submitted with his SOR Response.  \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.k. \u2013 a charged-off consumer debt of about $400. The Judge found, \u201cApplicant \nstated that this was his ex-wife\u2019s account that she opened in his name. He stated that he fought to \nhave it removed from his credit report and it no longer appears on the report.\u201d Decision at 3. Of \nnote, this debt still appears on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report. FORM Item 2 at 18-20. \n3. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m \u2013 two medical accounts of about $270 that were placed for collection.  \nThe Judge found, \u201cApplicant stated these were for hospital visits and should have been paid by the \n[Department of Veterans Affairs]. . . . They have been removed from his 2021 credit report.\u201d \nDecision at 3. \nDespite finding that Applicant disputed these debts and that they no longer appear on his \nmost recent credit report, the Judge failed to list MC 20(e) as a potentially applicable mitigating \ncondition and failed to provide any analysis regarding that mitigating condition. Under the \nDirective, a Judge must apply the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines that are appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-05110 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004). In this regard, Directive \u00b6 6.3 provides that \u201c[e]ach \nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon \nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and \nadjudication policy\u201d in the Adjudicative Guidelines. (Emphasis added.) See also Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.25 that requires a Judge\u2019s decision to set forth pertinent findings of fact, policies, and \nconclusions regarding the SOR allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s disputes are key issues pertaining to most of the remaining financial concerns. \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i) provides that, when a consumer disputes the \naccuracy of information contained in a credit report, the reporting agency will conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current \nstatus of the disputed information or delete the item from the file. Applying the substantial \nevidence standard (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1) to the present circumstances, a reasonable mind could \ninfer that Applicant\u2019s debts were deleted from his credit reports because he had a legitimate basis \nto dispute their accuracy. Such an inference is just as plausible as any other reasonable inference \nthat may be drawn from the absence of the debts on the credit report. Applicant\u2019s disputes along \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the fact that most of these debts no longer appear on his credit report was sufficient evidence \nto require the Judge to analyze them under MC 20(e). By failing to analyze the disputed debts \nunder MC 20(e), the Judge failed to consider an important aspect of the case and failed to examine \nrelevant evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-05110 at 2. Those omissions render the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Issues regarding how much weight should be \ngiven to this evidence or regarding what other matters may merit consideration under MC 20(e) \nare for the Judge, not the Appeal Board, to decide. \nGiven the significance of the disputed debts in comparison to the other remaining financial \nconcerns, I am unable to conclude that the Judge\u2019s error was harmless. The decision should be \nremanded to the Judge to correct this error.  \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F. Duffy \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \n6 \n",

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant is in his mid-forties, divorced, with an adult child. He served in the military \nfrom 1998 to 2015. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged nine delinquent debts, totaling about \n$53,000. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his security clearance \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplication by failing to disclose those debts. Applicant attributed his financial issues to his \ntransition from military service, a period of unemployment, divorce costs, and financial support \nfor his parents who had health issues.  Applicant admitted that he had falsified his SCA regarding \nhis delinquent debts because he feared that his debts would affect his clearance. Applicant resolved \na number of debts not alleged in the SOR. The Judge found for Applicant on three student loan \ndebts and resolved a duplicate allegation. He found adversely to Applicant on the remaining five \nGuideline F allegations and on the Guideline E falsification allegation.   \nIn addressing the mitigating conditions under Guideline F, the Judge concluded that several \ncircumstances that caused the financial issues were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but that Applicant \nfailed to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Regarding the five remaining \ndelinquent debts, Applicant \u201cprovided no documentary evidence that he has contacted the creditors \nor otherwise resolved the debts alleged.\u201d Decision at 8. In addressing the mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline E, the Judge highlighted that Applicant intentionally falsified his SCA, denied \nfinancial problems when questioned by a background investigator, and admitted them only after \nhe was confronted with adverse credit information. He concluded that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by the falsification.    \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of \nfact. Rather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by \nnot considering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions \nand whole-person concept. He argues, for example, that the Judge did not give appropriate weight \nto the circumstances that were beyond his control, to include his divorce, his period of \nunemployment, and his parents\u2019 medical issues. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient \nto rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor are they \nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01495 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2020). \nAdditionally, Applicant relies on hearing-level decisions in other cases to argue the Judge \nerred in his analysis of this case. Generally, how particular fact scenarios were adjudicated in other \ncases is not a relevant consideration in the Appeal Board\u2019s review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-03344 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). None of the hearing-level decisions that Applicant \ncites are sufficient to show the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

The Judge found in favor \nof Applicant on the Guideline G allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision overlooked certain information, \nincluding that his financial problems were linked to caring for his ailing father and mother and that \nhe has served in the military for almost 22 years. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, the Judge \nacknowledged the foregoing factors, but apparently placed less weight on them than Applicant \nwould prefer. For example, the Judge found that Applicant \u201cexperienced financial hardship after \ntraveling out-of-state to attend to his elderly parents and the unforeseen expenses associated with \nthe travel and their medical care,\u201d which amounted to a circumstance beyond his control, but \nconcluded that Applicant failed to show that he acted responsibly to resolve his financial issues, \nwhich is required for mitigation credit. Decision at 6. Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or \nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge overlooked that he voluntarily engaged in a \ntreatment program and abstained from alcohol consumption for a year following his 2017 DUI. \nWhile it is true that the Judge did not specifically address Applicant\u2019s participation in the program \nin her decision, she ultimately concluded that Applicant\u2019s past alcohol-related misconduct was \nmitigated through the passage of time since the last incident. Even if the Judge had ruled adversely \non the Guideline G allegations, Applicant\u2019s argument would again amount to a disagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of evidence. Because the Judge found favorably on the alcohol-related \nallegations, however, Applicant\u2019s argument is moot. \nFinally, Applicant asserts that, without a security clearance, he will lose his job and ability \nto provide financially for his child and mother. The adverse impact of an unfavorable clearance \ndecision is not relevant in evaluating clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-11222 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2009). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, and the \nrecord evidence is sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record. On November 18, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $28,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of those debts totaling about $11,000. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on each allegation. In the findings of fact and analysis, the Judge noted \nApplicant failed to provide documentation corroborating various claims. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that \u201c[n]ot all information reviewed in this case was up to \ndate or presented as I had stated previously.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nLachlan McKinion, Esq. \nDan Meyer, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 28, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. Prior to the hearing, the SOR was amended to include an allegation under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct). On June 9, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges under Guidelines J and E that Applicant was indicted in \nabout August 2016 for conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, false statements, \naiding and abetting and causing an act to be done, and uttering a forged instrument. He pleaded \nguilty in April 2017 to bank fraud and false statements and was sentenced to 12 months and one \nday confinement on each count, concurrent, followed by 24 months of supervised release and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nordered to pay restitution of about $337,000. In addition, the SOR alleged under Guideline E that \nApplicant was terminated from Federal employment in May 2017 following the foregoing arrest, \nand that he falsified statements made to a Government investigator in October 2019, denying that \nhe engaged in any of the conduct to which he pleaded guilty. The Judge found against Applicant \non the indictment and plea allegations, and the cross-alleged Guideline J allegations, and for \nApplicant on the falsification and termination allegations. In general, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns posed by his criminal behavior and personal \nconduct issues related to his indictment and conviction in Federal district court. \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence, \nfailed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole person factors, and made factual errors \nresulting in harmful error. \nApplicant is in his mid-50s and holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. In about 2011, \nApplicant started a nonprofit organization, a basketball program for about 20 or 30 underprivileged \nyouths. He currently works in the defense industry for a company supporting Government \ncontracts. He was previously employed by another government agency until May 2017, which was \nsoon after his Federal felony indictment, arrest, and guilty plea to bank fraud and false statements. \nRemaining counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, and uttering a forged instrument \nwere dismissed. The Judge found that Applicant was friends with a woman whose son was in \nApplicant\u2019s basketball program. Applicant\u2019s friend was facing foreclosure for a property she \nowned. In October 2013, Applicant created and filed fabricated certificates of satisfaction with the \ncity Recorder of Deeds for two liens on the woman\u2019s property. She then sold the home and received \nabout $337,000 in proceeds that should have been paid to the lender to satisfy the property\u2019s two \noutstanding mortgages. After the sale, the woman split the proceeds with Applicant, ostensibly as \na loan which he deposited into his bank account. Applicant allegedly failed to disclose the loan or \ngift on his Government financial disclosure form, and when he was interviewed by Federal law \nenforcement authorities, denied preparing, filing, or knowing about the false certificates of \nsatisfaction, or defrauding the mortgage lender. \nUpon advice of counsel, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count each of Federal bank fraud \nand false statements and was sentenced in July 2017 to confinement, followed by supervised \nprobation, a forfeiture money judgment, and an order to pay restitution of about $337,000. At the \nhearing, Applicant asserted that although he pleaded guilty on the advice and urging of his \nattorney, he initially intended to proceed to trial and expected to be found not guilty. However, he \nalso acknowledged his guilt before the Federal District Court judge by admitting that he was \npleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily and accepted full responsibility for what he did with an \nunderstanding of the possible punitive consequences. Decision (Dec.) at 6. Prior to his appearance \nbefore the Federal judge, he received a copy of the indictment, a \u201cStatement of Offense,\u201d and letter \nfrom the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office detailing the terms of the plea agreement. He acknowledged \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nstipulating to the Statement of Offense and signed it under penalty of perjury. Id. at 5. The \nStatement of Offense includes an admission that he filed false certificates of satisfaction with the \ncity Recorder of Deeds. It also states he \u201ccaused the creation\u201d of the two \u201cphony\u201d certificates and \nhe acknowledged that his friend received proceeds from the sale that should have gone to the bank. \nHe acknowledged that the $50,000 loan he received from his friend was part of those proceeds and \nthe $170,000 he received. Id. at 6. Applicant claimed in the hearing that, of the $170,000 in \nproceeds he received from the sale, $120,000 went to the basketball program for travel expenses, \nand he used $35,000 \u201cfor himself (\u2018for what I wanted\u2019).\u201d Id. at 7. \nAt his hearing and during an interview with a Government security investigator, Applicant \ndenied responsibility for the conduct despite his guilty pleas and admissions to the conduct in \nwriting and in Federal court. The Judge found that Applicant engaged in the scheme to defraud his \nfriend\u2019s mortgage lender and took the proceeds that should have been paid to the bank. The Judge \nfound that Applicant\u2019s conduct, including the element of dishonesty, and poor judgment were \nsufficient to implicate AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(e), (g), and 31(b). He noted that \u201cApplicant has had (and \ncontinues to have) difficulty accepting full responsibility and acknowledging that he committed \nany crimes, either generally or specifically,\u201d but that \u201che also did not intend to give false \ninformation in his interview.\u201d Id. at 12. The Judge also held that: \nHowever, this was not a single act of poor judgment or lack of impulse control. \nThis was a scheme, one that required planning and malice aforethought, and several \nsteps to accomplish it. At each one of those steps, Applicant could have pulled back \nand decided not to proceed. He did not do that. \n. . . . \nFurther, the mitigating effect of the age of the conduct is undercut by Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued insistence that he didn\u2019t do it and that he would have been found not \nguilty at trial. He pleaded guilty to the two charges and did so with considered \nadvice from legal counsel. He professed to be surprised that he went to jail at all \u2013 \nwhen he received less than the recommended term of 24 to 30 months. He claims \nnot to have been involved either with the creation of the phony certificates of \nsatisfaction or with filing them with the city, contrary to the specifics of the \nStatement of Offense, which he acknowledged, accepted voluntarily, and signed. \nHe asserted that the basketball team got $120,000 of the money he received, when \nthe evidence says he deposited it into his own back account. These assertions \nundercut his acceptance of responsibility for his actions. They undercut a showing \nthat he is fully rehabilitated. And they undercut his credibility since he professes \ninnocence that I simply do not believe. . . . I also conclude that he has never \naccepted full, unequivocal, unconditional responsibility for what he did \u2013 and for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwhat he pled guilty to. This lack of acceptance of responsibility significantly \nundercuts any claim of rehabilitation, even ten years on. [Id. at 13-14.] \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel claims the Judge committed harmful error as the decision \nis factually incorrect in parts; the Judge did not consider all available evidence; did not properly \napply the mitigating conditions under Guideline E; and failed to apply the whole-person factors, \nthus rendering the decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nIn particular, counsel asserts that facts cited in the Judge\u2019s decision are inaccurate and not \nsupported by evidence, including: \n(1) Applicant was never charged with money laundering. Appeal Brief at 14; Dec. at 4. \n(2) There is no evidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant used $35,000 for \nhimself (\u2018for what I wanted\u2019).\u201d Appeal Brief at 14; Dec. at 7. \n(3) Applicant never started a nonprofit organization despite the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[i]n \nabout 2011, Applicant started a nonprofit organization (NPO), a basketball program for \nabout 20 or 30 underprivileged youths.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14-15; Dec. at 4. \n(4) Applicant took responsibility for his actions despite the Judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cI also \nconclude that he has never accepted full, unequivocal, unconditional responsibility for \nwhat he did \u2013 and what he pled guilty to.\u201d Appeal Brief at 15; Dec. at 14. \nThese assertions of factual errors are specious, and in themselves contradicted by the \nrecord. First, allegations involving money laundering are found throughout the record, including \nin the SOR, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) case file report, and the personal subject \ninterview that Applicant adopted and certified as accurate. The Grand Jury Indictment uses the \nterm \u201cmonetary transactions\u201d and cites to 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1957 in two of the six counts alleged. This \nstatute is described by the U.S. Department of Justice as one of the Federal statutes \u201cproscribing \nmoney laundering\u201d enacted with the \u201cpassage of the Money Laundering Control Act, codified at \n18 U.S.C. \u00b6\u00b6 1956 and 1957.\u201d1 \nNext, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant used $35,000 for himself is found in Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony: \nSo, like I said, [$]120,000 of it went to the nonprofit organization. [$]50,000 of it \ninitially I had planned to use, but I ended up using [$]35,000 for what I wanted \n1 United States Department of Justice, Justice Manual 9-105-000 \u2013 Money Laundering, https://www.justice.gov \n/jm/jm-9-105000-money-laundering (2023). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause I gave her, you know, half of the check like $15,000, and the FBI knew \nthat. [Tr. at 53, emphasis added]. \nWith respect to counsel\u2019s claims that Applicant never started a non-profit organization, the \nhearing transcript shows the following: \nDepartment Counsel: You started [the B . . . Basketball Program] in 2011, is that \ncorrect? \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. \nDepartment Counsel: And why did you start the program? \nApplicant: There was a need. I had coached AAU basketball before and the kids in \nthose communities were kind of left out because of the pricing. And I just wanted \nto add an academic piece to it and give the kids an opportunity to play and be seen \non a national level and get the opportunity to get scholarships and go to college. \n[Tr. at 72-73.] \nTo the extent that counsel is challenging whether Applicant started a \u201cnon-profit organization\u201d or \nthe \u201cbasketball program\u201d within the existing non-profit organization, we find that distinction \nconstitutes no meaningful difference and, at most, is harmless error. \nFinally, counsel takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not accept \u201cfull, \nunequivocal, unconditional responsibility for what he did \u2013 and what he pled guilty to,\u201d which \ncounsel argues is not supported by the record. Applicant consistently obfuscated his position with \nrespect to his responsibility for the crimes charged; he accepted full responsibility for certain \ncrimes in the plea agreement and allocution statement to the Federal District Court Judge during \nsentencing, yet he denied that responsibility during his security clearance hearing. During cross \nexamination, Applicant admitted that he signed the Statement of Offense under penalty of perjury, \nand that it was true and correct. \nApplicant: I, you know, did what I was advised to do. \nDepartment Counsel: Okay. But you maintain your innocence today? \nApplicant: I mean, like I said, I have to go with, you know, that right there. So, that \n\u2013 me maintaining my innocence, that\u2019s the Catch-22 that I find myself in, right? So, \nto maintain my innocence would go against the very thing that have me sitting right \nhere right now, right?

[Tr. at 91.] \nIn contravention to his pleas in Federal court, Applicant claimed throughout the hearing that he \nsigned the plea agreement under duress, at the urging of his attorney, or with the hope that he \nwould receive a lenient sentence. Tr. at 91, 110, 113, 114-120. Applicant also wrongly claimed to \na Government security investigator that he \u201cinsisted that he was not guilty of the charges and \nrequested to go to trial to defend himself.\u201d GE 2 at 6. The record clearly shows that Applicant \nfailed to take \u201cfull, unequivocal, unconditional responsibility\u201d for his crimes at the hearing and \nthroughout his security investigation processing, despite his inconsistent plea and admissions \nbefore a Federal District Court Judge. The Appeal Board is required to give deference to a judge\u2019s \ncredibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. We find no reason not to give such deference in \nthis case. Furthermore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \nbased upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable conclusions that could be drawn from the \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03191at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019). \nThe Board has long held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in these proceedings \nand precludes applicants from contending they did not engage in the criminal acts for which they \nwere convicted. By claiming he did not commit the charges of which he was convicted and by \nraising theories of coercion and duress that constitute legal defenses to the criminal charges, \nApplicant is seeking to relitigate his felony conviction. The Board applies the doctrine of collateral \nestoppel and finds no merit in this assignment of error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01699 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2022). \nApplicant\u2019s remaining contentions that the Judge failed to consider all available evidence, \ndid not properly apply the mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and failed to apply the whole-\nperson factors are not supported by the record and we find no merit in these assertions. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on the factually uncontroverted indictment and guilty plea under both \nguidelines after discussing the relevant security concerns and mitigating conditions, and in \nconsideration of the nine whole-person factors. The decision is consistent with a complete and \nthorough evaluation of the evidence, mitigating conditions, and whole-person factors. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the requirements of the \nDirective in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record in reaching his \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01365 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2023). To the extent that \nCounsel re-argues the case in his brief, the Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.

On \nFebruary 17, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline M \n(Use of Information Technology) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 21, 2023, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found favorably for Applicant on five of the eight Guideline E allegations and \nadversely on the remaining three Guideline E allegations and on the Guideline M allegation. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge improperly considered evidence \nand mis-weighed evidence, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part \nbelow. \nApplicant is in his early fifties and married, with two children and a stepchild. He served \nin the military during the 1990s and was honorably discharged. He earned a master\u2019s degree in \n2013 and has worked for his current employer since 2019. \nAfter his discharge from the military in the late 1990s, Applicant worked for a defense \ncontractor and then as a civilian employee of the Army. In March 2009, he was counseled for \n\u201cinappropriate behavior of either making suggestive comments to other female employees or \nmaking them feel uncomfortable with his comments.\u201d Decision at 2, quoting Government Exhibit \n3 at 162. In April 2010, Applicant was notified of a proposed suspension for sexual harassment, \ninappropriate touching, and false statements. The alleged conduct included sexual banter in the \npresence of three female coworkers, sitting on the lap of a female coworker, and discussing sexual \nmatters with a female coworker. In late June 2010, Applicant and his command reached a \nsettlement agreement in which Applicant accepted a five-day suspension, served partially on non-\nduty days, and the command agreed to remove the suspension documents from Applicant\u2019s \nOfficial Personnel File within two years if there were no further infractions. \nIn July 2015, Applicant provided a statement in which he admitted that he took a test for \nanother employee who was having difficulty passing the test, using the employee\u2019s common access \ncard (CAC) and personal identification number (PIN). Applicant stated that he felt pressured to \nassist his colleague, that time was apparently of the essence, and that he took the test on the \nweekend on his own time. At his hearing, Applicant provided a different version of events, \ntestifying that he helped the fellow employee while the employee took the test, but that he did not \ntake the test for him. He testified that he did not remember his statement from 2015 and speculated \nthat it may have been altered. \nIn late 2018, Applicant\u2019s command ordered an inquiry into allegations of misconduct by \nApplicant. The report of investigation, issued in February 2019, revealed sexual harassment based \non unwanted attention by Applicant to three women, to include comments about Applicant\u2019s sex \nlife, questions about their sex life, or solicitations for sex. The commander and his staff attorney \n\u201cfound the investigation legally sufficient, the findings and recommendations supported by \nsufficient evidence, and the recommendations consistent with the findings.\u201d Id. In March 2019, \nApplicant resigned from his position and received a deferred retirement. \nApplicant has denied committing both the workplace misconduct that led to his 2010 \nsuspension and the workplace misconduct documented in the 2018 command inquiry. He stated \nhis belief that multiple people lied, either because they were biased, coerced, or compensated for \ndoing so, and he submitted documents in support of his position. \u201cI considered Applicant\u2019s \ndocuments and his testimony, but I did not find his testimony credible.\u201d Id. at 5. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe conduct alleged in the March 2009 counseling letter, the April 2010 notification of \nproposed suspension, and the 2018 command inquiry reflects questionable judgment and an \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and created a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. Security concerns are established under Guideline E. Under Guideline \nM, Applicant testified that, although he helped another employee take a test, he did not take the \ntest for him as alleged. However, his 2015 statement contradicts that testimony and is a more \naccurate description of what occurred. In summary, the Judge concluded: \nI accept that Applicant committed the misconduct identified in the April \n2010 notification of a proposed suspension and in the Commander\u2019s Inquiry. I am \nalso convinced that he used another employee\u2019s CAC and PIN to take a test for him. \nFinally, he has been dishonest for years, including at his hearing. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated under any of the mitigating \nconditions. [Decision at 10.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges three aspects of the Judge\u2019s decision. First, Applicant appears to \nargue that the Judge erred in considering the command investigation of 2010, as it was purged \nfrom his personnel record as part of the settlement agreement. At hearing, however, Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel voiced no objection to the admission of the document. Tr. at 9. Having failed to object to \nthe admissibility of the investigative report at the hearing, Applicant cannot now complain that the \ndocument was admitted into evidence and considered by the Administrative Judge. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0123 at 2 (Oct. 28, 1998). Moreover, even had counsel objected, the report is \nadmissible both as an official record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and as a public record under Federal \nRule of Evidence 803(8). To the extent that Applicant is also arguing that the Judge gave this \ninvestigative report undue weight, we find no basis in the record to support this assertion. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2009). The arguments regarding the 2010 \ncommand inquiry are without merit. \nSecond, Applicant revisits an SOR allegation that he falsified his security clearance \napplication. However, the Judge found favorably for Applicant on the falsification allegation, and \nit is not a matter before the Appeal Board. \nThird, Applicant argues that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence on the Guideline M \nallegation that he took an online exam on behalf of another employee. The Judge\u2019s decision in this \nregard was based in large part on his determination that Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, \nand we defer to that credibility determination. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. None of Applicant\u2019s \narguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in \nthe record or enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.

Applicant requested a hearing. On November 25, 2022, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Eric C. Price denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact \ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw insofar as it ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence.

He holds bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degrees and has worked for Federal contractors since mid-1990, supporting the same DoD \nagency for over 20 years.  Applicant has held a security clearance since the late 1980s. \nFrom about 1999 until March 2020 Applicant maintained a spreadsheet containing personal \nprivacy information, which he routinely transferred between his Government and personal \ncomputers via a USB drive or emails. From at least 2015 until 2020, the spreadsheet also included \nDoD protected information: access information for a Government safe, personal identification \nnumbers (PINs) for facility access, PINs for access to classified and unclassified IT networks, and \nthe PIN for his DoD ID card. Regarding the safe, Applicant\u2019s spreadsheet contained the word \n\u201cSafe\u201d followed by a six-letter passcode that could be converted to the combination. The last time \nthat Applicant engaged in this conduct was March 2020, discovery of which prompted an \ninvestigation into possible spillage of protected information.  \nWhen questioned about his activity, Applicant stated that he had transmitted the protected \ninformation in March 2020. He did not initially disclose that he had done so over 200 times since \n2015. The inquiry substantiated that Applicant had improperly transmitted protected information, \nsome of which was classified. An insider-threat security official testified at the hearing that \nApplicant\u2019s network PIN was determined to be classified, and that the PIN for the DoD agency \ndoor, Applicant\u2019s ID card, and the safe passcode were \u201csensitive DoD information.\u201d Decision at \n7, citing Tr. at 86, 96-99. \nIn the analysis, the Judge noted the extent of Applicant\u2019s security-significant conduct, his \ntraining on the proper handling of protected information, and evidence of inconsistent statements \nconcerning this matter. Under Guideline E, the Judge concluded that, in responding to those \ninvestigating the spillage, Applicant deliberately minimized his conduct. \u201c[T]he record as [a] \nwhole reflects that from at least 2015 to March 2020 Applicant maintained and updated protected \nDoD information in a spreadsheet that he routinely transmitted between his DoD email and \npersonal email accounts and that those actions contradicted written statements he provided to DoD \nsecurity officials[.]\u201d Decision at 11-12. He stated that he found Applicant\u2019s explanations to be \nlacking in credibility. \nAmong other things, the Judge cited to evidence that Applicant \nacknowledged that he had considered disclosing the full extent of his conduct but did not do so \nbecause \u201cit was not correct to bring in a new \u2018broader\u2019 email concern.\u201d Decision at 12, quoting \nAE L at 3. \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. We examine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if \nthey are \u201csupported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u204b \nE3.1.32.1. \nApplicant denies that he intentionally transmitted classified information to his unclassified \npersonal email account.

This statement is supported by the Incident Summary and \nby the testimony of the security official. Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 2; Tr. at 85-86. In his \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant also disclosed he mishandled classified information by \nstating, \u201cI stored and sent classified information within an unclassified email environment\u201d in \nApril 2020. GE 1 at 13 and 39. The Judge did not err in finding that the transmissions that \nApplicant made over the course of several years contained information that was classified.  \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s state of mind, the SOR did not allege nor the Judge explicitly find that \nApplicant acted with the specific intent to compromise classified information. Rather, the SOR \nand the Judge\u2019s findings underscore the improper nature of Applicant\u2019s conduct, which is \nconsistent with the record. \nApplicant denies that he intentionally sought to mislead investigators as to the scope of his \nsecurity-significant conduct. He stated that in his initial response to their inquiries he believed that \nthey were only concerned with the events of March 2020 and that when he realized that they were \nlooking into his prior behavior he was properly forthcoming. The allegation to which the \nchallenged finding is directed is as follows: \nBetween 2015 and 2020, you routinely made updates to sensitive [agency] \ninformation in the file you sent between your Government and personal email \naccounts, including the [agency] passcode in 2017.  These actions contradicted the \nwritten statements you made to security officials during the investigation of this \nincident. [SOR \u204b 2c.] \nWe note first of all that the record does not contain the actual questions posed by the \nofficials nor Applicant\u2019s written replies. However, Applicant does not deny that his initial \nresponse was limited to his conduct in 2020 and did not address his entire history of transmitting \nGovernment information to his private email account. His position has consistently been that his \ninitial response was not a deliberate effort to mislead but was simply an effort to answer the \nquestion asked. \nThe record contains evidence that undermines this contention: (1) Applicant\u2019s conduct \nwas of longstanding duration; (2) he updated and changed Government information over the course \nof his conduct (Tr. at 89); (3) he has received periodic training on handling protected information \nfrom which he knew or should have known that his conduct was improper; (4) he has worked for \nFederal contractors and held a clearance for decades, which also should have placed him on notice \nthat his conduct was improper; and (5) he admitted that he considered that the Government could \nbe concerned about his \u201clong term transferring\u201d of files but decided that \u201cit was not correct to bring \nin a new \u2018broader\u2019 email concern.\u201d Applicant Exhibit L, Statement by Applicant, at 3. On this \nlast point, the fact that Applicant\u2019s conduct was of many years\u2019 duration was not a new concern \nbut was squarely within the scope of the investigation at issue. That Applicant deliberated about \nthis matter and chose a more limited response undermines his contention of honest mistake. In \naddition, we note the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination, to which the Directive requires us \nto give deference. Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. Taken together the record supports the challenged \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinding. A person holding a security clearance has a duty to fully disclose conduct of security \nconcern when asked, and the record supports a conclusion that Applicant failed in this regard. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11898 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2007).  \nEven if the Judge erred in this finding, however, it did not likely affect the overall outcome \nof the case. Given the extent and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s improper transmission of protected \ninformation, had the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor concerning any willful act of full disclosure \nhe would still have denied Applicant a clearance. Therefore, any error in the challenged finding \nwas harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03640 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 2022). Applicant has \ncited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. The material findings of security concern set \nforth in the Decision are supported by substantial evidence.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at \n3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant cites to his having served the Government agency for many years. He also \ntestified the spreadsheet that he was emailing to and from his personal computer contained \nsensitive Government information. Tr. at 49-50. Again, the gravamen of the case is that Applicant \nimproperly transmitted protected Government information, including classified information, over \na number of years. The Judge did not rely upon a conclusion that Applicant intentionally failed to \nprotect classified information but that his conduct overall raises serious questions about his \njudgment and reliability. Security infractions \u201cstrike at the heart of the industrial security \nprogram\u201d and require strict scrutiny. ISCR Case No. 14-05127 at 9 (App. Bd. June 24, 2016). \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a \nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings or analysis. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On \nappeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in his findings of fact and misapplied the mitigating \nconditions.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized below, in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his late forties and divorced. He served in the military from 1993 to 1994 \nand was honorably discharged. Applicant was employed by a defense contractor between 2003 \nand 2015 and held a security clearance without incident. He has been employed by another defense \ncontractor since 2016. \nApplicant has suffered from \u201csevere and chronic depression for approximately 30 years.\u201d \nDecision at 3. His symptoms first emerged while he was in military training. Applicant was \nhospitalized for several months at a military medical facility and then discharged from the service. \nDuring that initial period, his depression manifested itself in auditory hallucinations and incidents \nof self-harm. \nSince 1996, Applicant has been treated at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities \nfor various mental health issues, including major depressive disorder, psychosis, suicidal ideations \nand attempts, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol dependence. The VA records in evidence \nindicate that Applicant has suffered from suicidal ideation for many years. Applicant made suicidal \ngestures at least fives times between 1992 and 2014, but he testified that he has not made any \nsuicidal gestures since 2014. He acknowledged continued suicidal thoughts until at least 2020. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s treatment at the VA continues to the present, the records reflect gaps \nthat ranged from months to years. His treatment at the VA has included medication therapy, but \nhe has repeatedly discontinued treatment over the years due to severe side effects. \nApplicant has consumed alcohol since 2006 and occasionally has engaged in binge \ndrinking. In 2010, he would drink a bottle of liquor approximately every two weeks when \ndepressed. He testified that he last drank what he considers a binge amount of alcohol in early \n2022. On at least two occasions, Applicant consumed alcohol and pills in suicide attempts. On \nother occasions, Applicant would engage in binge drinking when having obsessive thoughts about \nsuicide. Those incidents continued through at least 2014. \nApplicant admitted that the VA recommended in 2019 that he attend alcohol treatment. He \ndeclined because of work-related concerns and concerns related to a prior psychiatric \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\nhospitalization. Applicant also admitted that providers may have recommended treatment \npreviously, in approximately 2016. He testified that he does not believe he has an alcohol problem. \nIn April 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a DoD mental health consultant, who \ninterviewed Applicant, conducted screening tests, and reviewed his mental health records. The \npsychologist diagnosed major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission; post-traumatic \nstress disorder; and alcohol use disorder, mild. The psychologist gave Applicant a guarded \nprognosis for full recovery from his depressive disorder and his alcohol use disorder and a fair to \ngood prognosis for full recovery from PTSD symptoms. He concluded that: \nBased upon the available information, [Applicant] does evidence a material \ndefect in stability due to his chronic mood instability, chronic and repeated \nmaladaptive use of alcohol [binge drinking] without follow-through on \nrecommended alcohol treatment, minimal improvement in his major depressive \ndisorder and PTSD diagnosis since 1996, intermittent adherence to mental health \ntreatment regimen, and lifetime and recent history of suicidal ideation and multiple \nsuicide attempts. There is a potential security concern that he is not actively \naddressing his co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. Of particular \nconcern is the recent suicidal ideation and lack of help-seeking as evidenced by not \nresuming mental health treatment since November 2019 (last therapy session). [Id. \nat 5, quoting GE 6 at 9\u201310.] \nVA records confirm that Applicant met weekly or bi-weekly with a mental health team \nfrom December 2020 through August 2021 and from May 2022 to at least July 2022. Upon \nApplicant\u2019s request, his VA psychologist submitted a letter in August 2021, which confirmed his \nactive participation in treatment, his attendance at a 2021 group treatment program, and his \nsubsequent individual treatment. She stated that Applicant \u201cwas always responsive to treatment \nsuggestions and willing to implement new strategies\u201d and that she believed Applicant was \n\u201cabsolutely motivated to continue mental health treatment.\u201d Id. at 6, quoting SOR Response, \nAttachment E. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part. \nApplicant has been suffering with severe depression for many years. His \ntestimony, and the available medical records, show a person who has striven \nmightily to get control of his emotional problems. He has used the VA over the \nyears to assist him, and the records confirm that he has, in the main, followed \ntreatment recommendations and had successful therapy. Looked at as a whole, it is \nclear that his mental health and depression has improved dramatically over the \nyears. In particular, there is evidence that it has improved since the interview with \nthe DoD mental health consultant in April 2020. \n.\n.\n. \nBased on the totality of the available evidence, I find that there is no \nindication of a current problem. That has been true for about two years. . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, that is not the end of the discussion. The records show that Applicant has \nnot been consistent with his VA care over the years. He is primarily compliant, \nparticularly recently. His psychologist says he is motivated to continue treatment, \nbut that does not amount to a favorable prognosis as required by the Directive. . . . \n[T]here is not a current mental health finding that the previous condition is under \ncontrol or in remission and has a low possibility of recurrence or exacerbation. The \nstatement by Applicant\u2019s current psychologist, while helpful, does not meet the \nrequirements of the guideline. \nApplicant is highly commended for all he has done to improve his mental \nhealth over the years. Once again, it is obvious that he has showed tremendous \nimprovement. However, the strictures of the Guidelines as written require more \nfrom Applicant in terms of consistency of treatment and a current and favorable \nprognosis that rebuts the current report by the Government\u2019s mental health \nconsultant. Given the current state of the record, I cannot find that Applicant has \nsufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised by the evidence in this case. \n. \n. \n. \n[Regarding the Guideline G allegations,] [n]one of [the] mitigating \nconditions was established by the evidence in this case. A review of Applicant\u2019s \nmedical records indicate that alcohol has been a problem in his life. During his \nyounger days it was involved in several cases of attempted suicide or suicidal \nideation. He admitted that he still uses alcohol as a means to self-medicate during \ntimes of stress or depression. [Id. at 11\u201313.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant made at least five \nsuicidal gestures and his reference to \u201cseveral suicide attempts,\u201d asserting instead that there \u201cwere \nthree total attempts occurring in 1995 or 1996, 2005, and 2013.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2, 10. Applicant \nhighlights that \u201cremembering dates [is] difficult due to the intense nature of these situations.\u201d Id. \nat 2. However, the VA medical records support the Judge\u2019s findings, as they document three \nadditional attempts or gestures in 2012 and 2014, as reported by Applicant to his mental health \nproviders close in time to the events. GE 6 at 5; GE 9 at 27, 45, 79. \nApplicant also takes issue with the evaluation report prepared by Government\u2019s \npsychologist in at least two regards. First, he highlights that the report is from April 2020 and of \nlimited value in assessing his current mental health state. Second, he challenges the psychologist\u2019s \nconclusions regarding his alcohol consumption and the Judge\u2019s reliance upon those conclusions. \nHowever, Applicant did not object to the admission of the psychological evaluation into evidence \nat the hearing. Tr. at 11\u201314. His challenge on appeal does not go towards the admission of the \npsychological evaluation into evidence, but rather to the weight it should be given. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-02536 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2019). In this regard, we note that Applicant admitted \nto the related allegations in the SOR (i.e., that he had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence \nduring VA treatment and with alcohol use disorder by the evaluating psychologist). In addition to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Applicant\u2019s admissions and the psychologist\u2019s evaluation, the Government presented extensive \nVA mental health records in support of the allegations. \nOnce the allegations had been proven by Applicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence, \nApplicant was responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nresulting security concerns. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant argues that he has done so\u2014that he \nmitigated by demonstrating voluntary and ongoing compliance with a treatment plan and \nsubmitting his treating psychologist\u2019s letter. The Judge, however, explicitly considered these \nefforts at mitigation and concluded that they were at this point insufficient\u2014that the guidelines \nrequire a longer period of consistent treatment and that the statement by his current psychologist \ndid not amount to a favorable prognosis as required by the Directive. Decision at 11\u201312. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the psychological evaluation \nor any other record evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02536 at 2. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On February 13, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant is in his mid-50s and has been married to his current wife since 1998. He has \nworked as a network installer for a Defense contractor since 2021. Under Guideline F, the SOR \nalleged three financial concerns totaling approximately $21,000 in delinquent consumer debt. The \nSOR further alleged under Guideline E that, between 2017 and December 2018, Applicant \ncommunicated with and provided over $15,000 in financial assistance to two women whom he \nmet through an online dating website, one a resident citizen of the Philippines, and that he \ndeliberately failed to disclose his provision of over $17,000 to the Philippine national on his 2019 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance application (SCA).

He denied that \nhe intentionally falsified his SCA when he responded \u201cNo\u201d regarding whether he had ever \nprovided financial support to a foreign national, explaining that he misunderstood the question. \nDecision at 4. He initially repeated his negative response during his subject interview, and only \ndisclosed the contacts and financial support after being confronted by the investigator with the \ninformation. Decision at 5. The Judge found that \u201cnone of Applicant\u2019s [SCA] omissions of his \ncommunications with the two foreign nationals . . . were voluntarily corrected by Applicant in his \nensuing [interview] before he was confronted\u201d by the agent with the information. Decision at 10. \nThe Judge concluded that none of the Guideline F or E mitigating conditions fully applied. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions \nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant \nargues that the Judge \u201cdid not place appropriate weight on . . . the good faith efforts made and [the] \narticulated plan to pay off underlying delinquencies.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. However, the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccited delays in addressing his admitted debts . . . are not \nattributable to any extenuating hardship conditions that could impair his ability to timely address\u201d \nthem, and that debts were being \u201caddressed through payment plans initiated after the issuance of \nthe SOR\u201d is supported by the record, as is his conclusion that Applicant was \u201cnot able to \ndemonstrate a sufficient tangible track record of actual debt reduction.\u201d Decision at 8, 9. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal advocate for an alternative weighing of the evidence, which is \nnot enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that \nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.

We disagree. Our review of the \nrecord confirms that the Judge considered and discussed the issues highlighted by Applicant on \nappeal and complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering the totality of the evidence in reaching his decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 21, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 9, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30, \nessentially challenging the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed the Federal Government approximately $159,000 in \ndelinquent taxes for 2009, 2010, and 2013. The Judge found against Applicant on this sole \nallegation.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe alleged tax debt arose from two businesses that Applicant owned. One business failed \nin 2010 and the other was sold before he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2014. As his businesses \ndeclined during an economic recession, Applicant tried to keep his employees on the payroll \ninstead of laying them off. His office secretary informed him that she was paying the taxes, but \nhe was also aware of the IRS auctioning off his business equipment.  His financial problems were \nalso exacerbated by clients failing to pay their bills and by his divorce in 2013. Although he \nreceived a bankruptcy discharge in 2014, the IRS had filed a secured claim for over $150,000 in \nthat proceeding. He has not made any voluntary payments towards that debt, but the IRS withheld \nabout $47,000 of his tax refunds between 2010 and 2020. He did not explain why the tax refund \nwithholdings stopped in 2020, and he did not know the current balance of this debt. He failed to \nestablish a good-faith effort to pay the delinquent taxes or to show this debt is being resolved. The \nJudge concluded the alleged security concerns were not mitigated. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to comply with the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all the evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating \nconditions and whole-person concept.

He is rated as 70% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs and was diagnosed with PTSD after incurring an injury during one of the deployments. He was divorced in 2018 and remarried the same year. He has two children from his first marriage that live with him. Applicant provided contradictory statements with regard to the status of his 2017 Federal income tax return. He claimed that he filed his 2017 return in 2018. However, during his personal subject interview (PSI) by a government investigator in March 2019, Applicant admitted that he had not filed his 2017 tax return but planned to do so by the end of March 2019. He was again interviewed in October 2019 and stated that he still had not filed the 2017 return because he was gathering necessary documents. He said he filed his 2018 return and was audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who determined that he owed a penalty for withdrawal of funds from his Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The Judge found that the 2018 IRS tax transcript showed that Applicant\u2019s income tax return for that year was filed in March 2019, and an amended return was filed in September 2019.

He also asserted that the Judge did not properly weigh his resolved debts, \nconsider the age of his debts, and his belief that he may have been a victim of financial fraud when \napplying the mitigating conditions. \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 30s and employed by a defense contractor. He previously served \nhonorably in the military and twice deployed to Afghanistan. He is rated as 70% disabled by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and was diagnosed with PTSD after incurring an injury during \none of the deployments. He was divorced in 2018 and remarried the same year. He has two children \nfrom his first marriage that live with him. \nApplicant provided contradictory statements with regard to the status of his 2017 Federal \nincome tax return. He claimed that he filed his 2017 return in 2018. However, during his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) by a government investigator in March 2019, Applicant admitted that he \nhad not filed his 2017 tax return but planned to do so by the end of March 2019. He was again \ninterviewed in October 2019 and stated that he still had not filed the 2017 return because he was \ngathering necessary documents. He said he filed his 2018 return and was audited by the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) who determined that he owed a penalty for withdrawal of funds from his \nThrift Savings Plan (TSP). \nThe Judge found that the 2018 IRS tax transcript showed that Applicant\u2019s income tax return \nfor that year was filed in March 2019, and an amended return was filed in September 2019. In \ntestimony, Applicant said he filed his 2017 tax return in late 2018 or early 2019. He presented a \n2018 IRS tax account transcript, but not one for tax year 2017. In a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant expressed his inability to obtain his 2017 account transcript from the IRS, but presented \na 2017 wage and income transcript as proof that he filed his 2017 return and paid a penalty. The \nJudge noted that the wage and income transcript did not state whether a tax return had been filed. \nDecision at 2, 3. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant provided inconsistent explanations about his 2017 \nFederal tax return and surmised that Applicant had confused his 2017 tax year with his 2018 tax \nyear return. The Judge held that Applicant failed to carry his burden to show that he filed his 2017 \nFederal income tax return, and therefore suggested a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. In addition, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor for most of the \nalleged debts, often giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt, but held that two debts in collections \nfor $1,896 and $986 were not resolved. \nThe Judge noted that Applicant thought he closed the account to a telecommunications \ncompany for which he owed $1,896, paid the debt, and disputed the account. The Judge found that \nthe account was listed as an individual account with the last activity in 2017, and that his credit \nreport did not note a dispute on the account. The other debt for $986 resulted from Applicant \nfinancing a computer in 2015. Applicant said he did not pay the debt and agreed it likely fell off \nhis credit report due to age.

Decision at 9. The \nJudge also noted Applicant\u2019s letters submitted on his behalf and said Applicant \u201cprovided an \neloquent plea to retain his security clearance\u201d in addressing his patriotism, disability, and \nunquestioned military service. Decision at 5. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant admitted that he did not file his 2017 Federal income tax return when \nit was due, but argues that he told the Judge that he filed his 2017 and 2018 income tax returns in \nMarch 2019. He contends that the Judge\u2019s decision attempts to show him as a liar, and that his \nmemory loss may result from his PTSD. He then reasserts all of the favorable findings in the record \nto argue that the Judge should have found in his favor. Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge failed \nto weigh the evidence appropriately or consider all of the relevant evidence, including Applicant\u2019s \nPTSD condition, is without merit. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he did not file the tax return on time but \nargued that he was transitioning from the Army and did not have the necessary documents to file \nthe return. His assertion on appeal that he filed his 2017 tax return in March 2019 is not supported \nby persuasive record evidence, as he merely reasserts substantially the same information that was \npresented to the Judge. The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. Regardless, failure to file and pay taxes when due raises a concern that a \nperson may be lacking in the reliability and judgement necessary for the protection of classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017). \nApplicant next asserts that payment of his delinquent credit card accounts and other debts \nshows the progress he is making toward repairing his credit status. He also argues he was a victim \nof fraud, divorced, and that his PTSD may have prevented him from resolving the debts, including \nthe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on most of the \ndebts, including the debts he raised in his appeal, but found that two other debts in collections that \nApplicant had not provided evidence of voluntary payments, were not mitigated. Applicant stated \nin his answer to the SOR that these two debts the Judge found were unresolved, were \u201cdue to the \nspoils of divorce,\u201d and that he was \u201cseeking resolution with this account.\u201d Nothing in Guideline F \nindicates that there is any particular threshold amount of delinquent or otherwise unresolved debts \nthat must be reached before an applicant\u2019s financial difficulties raise security concerns. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-05289 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2017), citing ISCR Case No. 02-10168 (App. Bd. \nAug. 1, 2003). It is well established, however, that an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \ndemonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, \n2017). \nFinally, the evidence is clear that the Judge adequately considered Applicant\u2019s personal \ncircumstances and his PTSD condition, specifically noting his military service and \u201cparticularly \nhis combat deployments,\u201d and said Applicant is \u201con the right track financially, but for whatever \nreason, he did not provide documents that might have been able to mitigate the security concerns.\u201d \nDecision at 9. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal.

He entered the U.S. \nmilitary in 1972 and retired in 1995. During his military career, Applicant\u2019s various assignments \nrequired him to supervise between 150 and 300 personnel. He began working for his current \nemployer, a Defense contractor, in early 2022 and has held a security clearance for many years. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges five delinquent debts to the U.S. Department of Education (DoE) \nfor student loans taken out for the benefit of two of his children.  The total amount of such debt is \n$280,000. His financial problems began in 2011 when he became ill and had to undergo \ncardiovascular surgery. While recuperating, Applicant\u2019s wife took over family finances and was \nnot aware that their obligation to repay the student loans had begun. Beginning in 2012 DoE \ngarnished Applicant\u2019s wages, resulting in payments of between $800 and $1,200 a month. \nHowever, in May 2018 Applicant lost his job and did not regain employment until September of \nthat year at a salary lower than he previously had received. Applicant did not resume payments \non the student loan debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were also affected by an IRS bill for $22,000 owed due \nto Applicant\u2019s having taken distributions from his 401(k) plan. Since 2021, he has been paying \noff this obligation through a payment plan. In late 2020, the Federal Government issued a \nmoratorium on repayment of student loans, which was set to expire in August 2022, at which point \nApplicant asserts that he will resume repayment on the debts.  \nApplicant has between $3,000 and $4,000 after-expense income each month, owns a home \nworth $700,000, and has an emergency expense fund of about $2,000. In 2015, he purchased a \nyacht for about $20,000, for which he paid cash. He also purchased a vehicle for $47,000, \nfinancing it through payments of about $1,220 a month. \nThe Judge noted circumstances that affected Applicant\u2019s financial problem that were \nbeyond his control, such as his illness and lengthy recuperation. However, he concluded that \nApplicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his debts. Though acknowledging \nthat student loans were still in deferment as of the close of the record and that Applicant received \na substantial bill from the IRS, he stated that these circumstances arose two to three years after \nApplicant regained employment in September 2018. Accordingly, the Judge concluded that these \nevents cannot explain or excuse Applicant\u2019s failure to have resumed addressing his SOR debts \nduring the intervening years.  \nThe Judge described Applicant\u2019s military career as \u201cstellar\u201d and noted his having held a \nclearance for many years. However, he also cited to the length of time Applicant\u2019s account has \nbeen delinquent and to his other discretionary expenditures\u2014the yacht club fees and the vehicle\u2014 \nthat left him with \u201clingering concerns about [Applicant\u2019s] financial judgment[.]\u201d  Decision at 6. \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.

Directive \u204b E3.1.32.1. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he owes $280,000 on the student loans, arguing that \nthe true amount is about $199,000. The record evidence is not consistent as to the total amount of \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts. The Judge\u2019s finding is supported by Applicant\u2019s answers during his \nsecurity clearance interview. Government Exhibit (GE) 7, Clearance Interview Summary, at 4. \nHowever, Applicant testified that he believed this number to be inaccurate. Tr. at 33. The SOR \nallegations total a little less than $199,000, which Applicant admitted in his Answer to the SOR \nand certified as accurate during his hearing testimony. Tr. at 15-16. In addition, GE 2, Credit \nReport dated May 2018, lists debts in an amount closer to the SOR allegations than to the assertion \nin GE 7. After considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the greater weight of the \nevidence does not support a finding of $280,000. Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat his house is worth $700,000. We agree with Applicant that the record includes no evidence \nas to the value of Applicant\u2019s house, although he testified that he owes about $110,000 on his \nmortgage. Tr. at 74-75. The challenged finding is erroneous. However, we note that the Judge \ndid not rely on these findings in his analysis, focusing instead on a lack of evidence of meaningful \ndebt resolution efforts following Applicant\u2019s 2018 reemployment and on discretionary spending \nthat could have been better directed toward resolving the debts at issue here. We conclude that, \neven if the Judge had not made these errors, his overall decision would have been the same. \nAccordingly, we conclude that the errors are harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by \nsubstantial record evidence. Id. \nApplicant cites to evidence of his military service, the circumstances underlying his \nfinancial difficulties, his efforts to pay his student loan debts as well as the DoE garnishment \naction, his payment plan to resolve his unexpected Federal tax obligation, and other matters that \nhe argues support his case for a favorable result. However, the Judge made findings about these \nmatters and discussed several of them in the analysis. Applicant has not rebutted the presumption \nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor shown that the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, the Judge \ncomplied with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he considered the totality of the evidence \nin reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02925 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nWe have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s contentions on appeal and conclude that \nthe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings or analysis. The decision \nis sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nJeffrey D. Billett, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 15, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On January 5, 2023, after the close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant carried a delinquent Federal tax balance of about $131,000 \nfor tax years 2010 through 2016 and 2018, that he failed to timely file his Federal returns for tax \nyears 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018, and that he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax years \n2010 through 2015, 2017, and 2018. The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations. On \nappeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge was biased against him, made findings of fact that are \neither incomplete or unsupported by the evidence, and failed to properly apply the mitigating \nconditions.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 60s and has held a security clearance since 1991. He has been \nmarried since the late 1980s and has three adult children. Applicant has earned multiple advanced \ndegrees, including a PhD in 1989. He has worked for the same academic institution for almost two \ndecades, and also works as an independent contractor. As of the hearing, his salary was $258,000 \nper year and his consultant income varied annually. Between 2009 and 2017, his adjusted gross \nincome ranged from a low of about $180,000 in 2009 to a high of about $456,700 in 2016. \nThe Judge found that Applicant enjoyed a substantial income but prioritized other expenses \nover his annual tax balance. She concluded that Applicant had a history of failing to timely file \nand pay his Federal and state income taxes and that, despite having clear notice of the deficiencies, \nhe failed to take meaningful action to address them until after he completed his security clearance \napplication at the end of 2018. The Judge acknowledged that Applicant appeared to have remedied \nhis state tax problems but found that was insufficient mitigation in light of his past and ongoing \ntax problems. \nDiscussion \nBias \nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge was biased against him and takes issue with the \ncontent and method of her questions. We do not find his argument persuasive. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that \npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 14, 2004). The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes that the Judge was biased \nor prejudiced against him but, rather, whether the record \u201ccontains any indication that the Judge \nacted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of \nthe Judge.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). \nApplicant cites several examples in which the Judge questioned him about his tax \ncompliance history and the advice he received from tax professionals, while making comments \nabout his credibility and what Applicant perceived as lectures about his financial decisions. To the \nextent that the Judge concurrently opined about the credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony, that is \npermissible within the scope of her role. A Judge may form and express an opinion about the \nevidence at hearing, including the credibility of a witness, and does not demonstrate bias in doing \nso. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 94-0972 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 1995) (The Judge is responsible for \nassessing witness credibility and \u201cthinking out loud on [the] subject of that credibility is not \nimproper.\u201d). The transcript in this matter reflects that the Judge\u2019s questions were often pointed; \nhowever, they were targeted to the issues to be determined at hearing. Even where the Judge\u2019s \nmanner may be deemed \u201cinconsistent with the decorum normally anticipated in the courtroom,\u201d \nthat alone is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge decided the case on the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006) (no bias where the \nJudge\u2019s comments were \u201cgratuitous and at times harsh\u201d). See also ISCR Case No. 15-03162 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2017) (no impartiality although the Judge \u201cquestioned Applicant sharply at \ntimes); ISCR Case No. 16-03451 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Mar. 9, 2022) (no \nimpartiality where the Judge\u2019s \u201cquestioning and comments were occasionally sharp\u201d). \nApplicant also asserts that, beginning early in the hearing, the Judge inappropriately \nadopted both an aggressive and excessive questioning strategy towards Applicant and an overly \ncooperative posture toward Department Counsel. Applicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 3, 9-10. He argues \nthat the Judge\u2019s manner of asking questions \u201ctook the reins out of the hands of Department \nCounsel\u201d and \u201ccircumvented [his] prerogative to present his case in the manner he preferred.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 9. He also contends that he \u201cwas not given a fair chance to present his \ncase unfettered by interruptions and lengthy, aggressive questioning and gratuitous comments by \nthe Judge.\u201d Id. at 4. \nA review of the transcript reflects that Applicant began testifying by reading a prepared \nstatement without any interruptions. Tr. at 23-29. As he started to address specific SOR allegations, \nthe following exchange occurred: \n[Judge]: . . . I think the easiest way to go about this, if you both agree, is that, \nnormally, you [addressing Applicant] would testify, sir, and when you\u2019re finished \ntestifying, then [Department Counsel] would ask you questions. \n[Applicant]:  Okay. \n[Judge]: To kind of stay organized, I think it might be easier that as we -- as you \naddress each tax year, if I have any questions about 2010, I ask them, and \n[Department Counsel] asks hers, so that you don\u2019t have to go back and rehash \neverything. Are you both okay with that? \n[Applicant]:  Okay. \n[Judge]: I don\u2019t know if that messes up your cross, [Department Counsel]. Is that \nall right? \n[Department Counsel]:  I think I\u2019ll be able to make it work. \n* * * \n[Judge]: Both of you will have any opportunity to ask or answer anything you want. \n[Id. at 29-30.] \nIn responding to some of the Judge\u2019s basic questions regarding the first SOR allegation, Applicant \nexpressed a lack of knowledge or uncertainty. Id. at 30-34. Considering those responses, the Judge \ndecided to leave the record open for two weeks after the hearing to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional matters. Id. at 41. Later, the Judge asked Applicant whether he \nhad any objection to turning the questioning over to Department Counsel because she was \u201cpretty \norganized.\u201d Id. at 48. Applicant indicated he had no objection to proceeding in that manner. Id. \nThe Judge noted that \u201cyou can explain whatever you want, and when she\u2019s done, we\u2019ll give you \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmore time to say whatever it is . . . that you may want to clear up, okay?\u201d Id. at 48-49. Applicant \nagain responded in the affirmative. Id. As agreed, Applicant testified in that manner with \nDepartment Counsel asking the initial questions about an allegation and the Judge asking clarifying \nquestions before moving on to the next allegation. Upon completion of the questioning, Applicant \nwas provided an opportunity to present any other testimony he desired, and he took advantage of \nthat opportunity. Id. at 150-152. \nUnder the Directive, a Judge in a DOHA hearing is tasked with conducting the proceedings \nin a fair, timely, and orderly manner. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10. As finder of fact, the Judge \u201cenjoys \nconsiderable latitude in conducting the proceedings, to include asking questions to clarify the \nrecord.\u201d ISCR Case No. 11-08844 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2013). We find no bias or harmful error \nin the manner in which the Judge conducted the hearing. \nHaving examined the record, paying particular attention to the transcript, we find that \nApplicant\u2019s concerns are insufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption that the Judge acted \nin an impartial and unbiased manner. \nErrors in Findings of Fact and Failure to Apply Mitigating Conditions \nApplicant next argues that the Judge made certain findings and reached conclusions that \nwere either incomplete or not supported by the record. For example, Applicant takes issue with \nthe Judge\u2019s finding that it was \u201clikely\u201d that the IRS terminated his prior installment agreement \nbecause he failed to file his 2013 tax return. Decision at 12; Applicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 10. \nApplicant testified that he could not recall the reason that the earlier Installment Agreement was \nterminated and, without contradictory evidence in the record, the Judge\u2019s inference was reasonable \nbased on the existing evidence. Moreover, the reason that Applicant\u2019s Agreement was terminated \nis a lesser concern to the fact that the Agreement was, in fact, terminated, along with Applicant\u2019s \ndilatory resolution efforts until 2019. Even if the Judge\u2019s inference in this instance was incorrect, \nthe error would be harmless considering the magnitude of Applicant\u2019s tax deficiencies. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the findings fail to establish any harmful error. \nThe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial evidence or \nconstitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence,\u201d and \nApplicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. See ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief, including his argument that the Judge failed to give \nadequate weight to potentially mitigating factors, amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Applicant has not rebutted the \npresumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he established that \nher conclusions were arbitrary and capricious. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of \nthis case or in her decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexplanation for her decision, and the record evidence is more than sufficient to support that the \nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable on appeal.

The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his mid-40s, is married with two children. He immigrated to the United States \nin 2009 and was naturalized in 2011. Applicant served on active duty as a combat engineer in the \nU.S. military from 2011 to 2014. He earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees prior to immigrating \nand earned a second master\u2019s degree in the U.S. in 2015.

Following days of \nsleeplessness and erratic behavior, his wife called the police and Applicant was involuntarily \nadmitted to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital, where he was diagnosed with schizoaffective \ndisorder, bipolar mood disorder, and sleep deprivation. He was stabilized with medication and \nreleased to outpatient care and, in November 2018, began seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner \n(PNP). Applicant\u2019s medication and treatment plan were adjusted to address negative side effects. \nIn February 2019, Applicant stopped taking his medications and his symptoms returned \nlater that month. His wife again contacted the police and Applicant was involuntarily admitted to \na psychiatric unit for six days. Upon his discharge, he resumed treatment with the PNP and \nfollowed his treatment plan for five months. \nIn July 2019, Applicant again stopped taking his medications and his symptoms returned. \nHe was involuntarily hospitalized in August 2019 and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, \nbipolar disorder, and catatonia. Applicant was released and resumed treatment with the PNP, but \nin 2020 he transferred his care to a certified registered nurse practitioner in psychiatric mental \nhealth (CRNP/PMH). \nApplicant remained compliant with his treatment plan with the CRNP/PMH; however, in \nNovember 2020, he began experiencing symptoms again. His wife attempted to have him \nhospitalized but was unsuccessful due to COVID-19 protocols. The CRNP/PMH adjusted \nApplicant\u2019s medications, but he continued to experience symptoms, becoming increasingly \ndisoriented and erratic. In December 2020, his wife filed a missing person report after Applicant \nwandered out of his home. He was found by police and involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care. \nFollowing this fourth hospitalization, the CRNP/PMH again adjusted Applicant\u2019s medication. \nIn consideration of the foregoing and in conjunction with his request for security clearance, \nApplicant participated in a mental health evaluation in March 2021 with a Government-approved \npsychologist. The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, in \npartial remission, and unspecified anxiety disorder, and opined that the conditions would require \nongoing, consistent lifelong treatment to maintain stability. He opined that, while Applicant is \nstable on his pharmaceutical regimen, that could change and lead to the return of his symptoms if \nhe experiences changes in his physiology, stops taking his medication, or experiences a significant \nincrease in stress. The psychologist noted that, while Applicant \u201chas now developed the opinion \nthat he needs the medications and has resolved to adhere to his provider\u2019s recommendation,\u201d he \nalso \u201ccomplains about many immediate, and potentially long term, side effects of his multiple \nmedications,\u201d which are \u201cnot inconsequential.\u201d Decision at 4 (quoting Government Exhibit (GE) \n3 at 6). Specifically, the medications \u201cseem to have muted his affect, slowed his processing speed, \nand negatively impacted his frontal lobe functioning (i.e., attention control and problem solving),\u201d \nall of which are \u201ccognitive skills needed to successfully safeguard information.\u201d Id. The \npsychologist concluded that \u201cthere is a considerable risk [Applicant\u2019s] symptoms will resurface at \nsome point in the future\u201d and therefore \u201chis condition could negatively impact his judgment and \nreliability\u201d and \u201cdiminish[] his capacity to safeguard national security information.\u201d Decision at 5 \n(quoting GE 3 at 7). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing the September 2022 hearing, the Judge found that Applicant has consistently \ncomplied with his treatment plans since September 2019 and has not experienced any negative \nside effects or return of symptoms since his last major medication adjustment following the \nDecember 2020 hospitalization. Per the psychologist\u2019s evaluation, Applicant\u2019s symptoms have \nbeen in remission since early 2021.

On appeal, the Government \nargues that the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline I mitigating conditions and her whole-person \nanalysis were arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. For the reasons set \nforth below, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nDiscussion \nA Judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if \u201cit does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant \nfactors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it \noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at \n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983)). The Government argues that the Judge arbitrarily applied AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(c) \n\u201cin direct contradiction with the Judge\u2019s own findings and the weight of the record evidence.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 12. We agree. \nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 29(a) \nWe turn first to AG \u00b6 29(a), which provides for mitigation when \u201cthe identified condition \nis readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent \ncompliance with the treatment plan.\u201d It is a two-prong condition, requiring that both elements are \nmet to apply. Here, the Judge appears to have relied entirely on Applicant\u2019s fulfillment of the \nsecond prong \u2013 that he demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment plan, \ndespite the weight of evidence against finding that his condition is readily controllable with \ntreatment. \nAs of the September 2022 hearing, the record reflected that Applicant had been compliant \nwith his treatment plan for about three years, since September 2019, and had not experienced any \nreturn of symptoms since his fourth hospitalization in December 2020. The record also contained \nmultiple indicators, however, that Applicant\u2019s stability was not permanent and could change for a \nvariety of reasons, which detracts from a finding that his condition is readily controllable with \ntreatment. For example, the psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s current stability \u201ccould change \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover time with changes in his physiology, if he were to stop taking medications, or if his stress \nlevel significantly increases,\u201d which \u201cwould almost certainly [lead to Applicant experiencing] \nperceptual disturbances and/or disordered thinking.\u201d GE 3 at 7. \nThe Judge acknowledged the foregoing concern, but apparently deemed it overcome \nbecause Applicant and his wife represented that they \u201care diligent in monitoring his behavior for \nthe return of symptoms and . . . will seek medical intervention when it is needed.\u201d Decision at 7. \nThe Judge also noted that Applicant and his wife have \u201cdeveloped a plan to handle any future \nemergencies, in which she calls Applicant\u2019s employer to inform them of his inability to work.\u201d \nDecision at 5-6. While the Judge analyzed this information favorably, the totality of the record \nsuggests that these precautions are an acknowledgment of the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s \nsymptoms may return and undercuts a finding that his condition is readily controllable at this time. \nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 29(c) \nThe Government next challenges the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 29(c), which is also a \ntwo-prong condition that affords mitigation via a recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional, employed or approved by the U.S. Government, that an individual\u2019s previous \ncondition: 1) is under control or in remission; and 2) has a low probability of recurrence or \nexacerbation. Whether the first prong was met in this case requires a more complicated analysis,1 \nwhich is ultimately unnecessary because the facts unequivocally fail under the second prong. \nIn her mitigation analysis, the Judge echoed the psychologist\u2019s opinion that \n\u201c[p]hysiological and environmental changes could decrease the effectiveness of [Applicant\u2019s] \ntreatment protocol, resulting in the recurrence of symptoms and the possibility of future \nhospitalizations.\u201d Decision at 7. She also noted that the psychologist\u2019s \u201cfair at best\u201d prognosis was \n\u201creasonable given the nature of Applicant\u2019s illness and the potential for the recurrence of \nsymptoms even when he is compliant with [his] treatment plan.\u201d Decision at 8 (emphasis added). \nDespite the foregoing, the Judge went on to find AG \u00b6 29(c) applicable. \nThe decision is devoid of explanation for how the Judge simultaneously found that \nApplicant\u2019s symptoms both have the potential for recurrence, even when he is compliant with \ntreatment, and have such a low probability of recurrence as to warrant application of AG \u00b6 29(c). \nWeighing Record Evidence \nIn addition to his and his wife\u2019s testimony, the evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth history and status consisted of hospitalization records and opinions from three mental health \n1 The psychologist qualified the remission element of the diagnosis by opining that Applicant is in partial remission, \nas opposed to full remission. GE 3 at 6. What, if any, impact this qualification has on the application of AG \u00b6 29(c) is \nunclear from the record. Moreover, and importantly, the psychologist\u2019s April 2021 report indicates that he was \nunaware of Applicant\u2019s fourth hospitalization, which occurred only five months earlier, in December 2020. \nSpecifically, the psychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccondition necessitated three involuntar[y] hospitalizations \nduring 2018 and 2019,\u201d and the psychologist further opined that \u201cit seems [Applicant\u2019s] symptoms came under control \nwhen he was prescribed [medications] in late 2019 as he has not had a relapse since it was added.\u201d GE 3 at 1, 7 \n(emphasis added). Therefore, the psychologist\u2019s opinion that Applicant\u2019s condition is in even partial remission appears \nto be based on incomplete information, which calls into question the legitimacy of any \u201cremission\u201d determination. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessionals, including Applicant\u2019s two providers and the Government-approved psychologist. \nApplicant\u2019s therapeutic provider submitted a three-sentence letter from April 2022 acknowledging \nthat Applicant was engaged in treatment and that his symptoms were stable over the five months \nthey had worked together. Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Notably, Applicant initiated this treatment \nthree months after receiving his SOR. The CRNP/PMH also submitted a two-sentence letter from \nApril 2022, confirming that Applicant had been a patient since February 2020, and that he was \ncompliant with treatment and stable. AE B. Neither of these providers addressed any testing \nconducted with Applicant, his diagnoses, or his prognosis. \nConversely, following an in-person clinical interview and testing, the psychologist wrote \nan extensive report that addressed Applicant\u2019s mental health history, clinical observations, and \ndiagnostic impressions. The psychologist opined that there is considerable risk that Applicant\u2019s \nsymptoms will resurface in the future and therefore that his condition could negatively impact his \njudgment, reliability, and capacity to safeguard national security information. \nIn summary, in the five years since Applicant began experiencing mental health concerns, \nhe has voluntarily discontinued his medications two times; has been involuntarily hospitalized four \ntimes; and has been diagnosed with, among other things, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, \nincluding most recently by a Government-approved psychologist who opined in a robust report \nabout serious concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s continued stability and ability to safeguard national \nsecurity information. In contrast, evidence favorable to granting clearance eligibility consisted of \ntestimony from Applicant and his wife, along with two conclusory letters from Applicant\u2019s \nquarterly treatment providers that state, without elaborating, that he is stable and compliant with \ntreatment. \nAdministrative Judges have responsibility for, and broad discretion in weighing evidence; \nhowever, that discretion is not unlimited, and a judge is not free to draw whatever inferences and \nconclusions she wants. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 13-14 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000) \n(citations omitted). Moreover, a judge may not ignore or disregard \u201csignificant record evidence \nthat a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned \ndecision.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-22603 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 2004). \nHere, the record\u2019s unfavorable evidence, such as Applicant\u2019s multiple hospitalizations, \nfailures to follow treatment advice, and the psychologist\u2019s conclusion regarding Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and capacity to safeguard national security information were highlighted \nthroughout the Judge\u2019s findings and analysis. Even so, the Judge discounted the significant \nunfavorable evidence when she effectively conducted a piecemeal analysis in reaching a decision \nthat focused on the relatively slight favorable evidence and ultimately concluded that it outweighed \nthe unfavorable. The Judge\u2019s lack of a satisfactory explanation for her weighing of said evidence \nresults in an unsustainable decision. \nThe standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). From our review \nof the record, there was insufficient evidence for the Judge to conclude that \u201cno doubts [exist] \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness.\u201d Decision at 8. The Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary \nto the weight of the record evidence, and was therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to \nlaw. The record, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Egan. Therefore, the decision is not sustainable. \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 3, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On December 28, \n2022, after the close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in about June 2016; that \nhe was charged with felony Creating Unlawful Image of a Minor and Peep/Spy: Locker/Dressing \nRoom; that he was found guilty of Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor and Peep/Spy into \nDwelling; and that he received a suspended prison sentence of 30 days. The same behavior was \ncross-alleged under Guideline J and Guideline E. The Judge found against Applicant on all \nallegations. Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made findings of \nfact that are unsupported by the evidence and whether he misapplied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are summarized below, in \npertinent part. \nApplicant is in his late thirties and married, with three children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree and served in the U.S. military for approximately 12 years before he was administratively \nseparated in 2018 with an other than honorable discharge for the conduct alleged in the SOR.   \nIn June 2016, Applicant entered a retail clothing store and, at some point, entered a dressing \nstall. The dressing stall adjacent to his was occupied.  Applicant stood on a bench in the dressing \nstall and held his cell phone over the top of the stall, intending to take a picture of the occupant in \nthe adjacent stall. Before he could take the photo, the occupant\u2014a minor female who was trying \non swimwear\u2014saw the phone, screamed, and ran out of the stall.  Applicant left the store, but the \npolice identified him as a suspect and arrested Applicant at his home. Initially charged with a \nfelony offense of \u201cunlawful filming of a minor\u201d and a misdemeanor offense of \u201cpeeping,\u201d \nApplicant entered into a plea agreement in November 2016 under which he pleaded \u201cNo Contest\u201d \nto two misdemeanors: contributing to the delinquency of a minor and peeping. Applicant was \nsentenced to one year of probation and was required to complete a psychosexual evaluation. Based \nupon the June 2016 incident, Applicant was administratively separated from the military with an \nother than honorable discharge. \nDr. C conducted Applicant\u2019s court-ordered psychosexual evaluation, which consisted of a \nreview of relevant records, clinical interviews, and psychological testing. Dr. C reported that the \n\u201cexamination did not reveal any underlying mental disorder or personality disorder\u201d; that \nApplicant reported an obsession with pornography; and that Applicant\u2019s sexual interest assessment \nindicated an interest in pornography and voyeurism. Decision at 3. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he engaged in similar conduct at a different clothing \nstore about one month before the charged incident. During the earlier incident, he put his phone \nover a dressing stall and surreptitiously took a picture of a woman in her 30s, but he was not \ndiscovered by law enforcement or charged. Although Applicant claimed to have disclosed this \nprior incident to his counselor, Dr. C\u2019s report only references one victim and characterizes \nApplicant\u2019s offense \u201cas an isolated incident as well as an impulsive act.\u201d  Id., quoting AE B at 3. \nI can reasonably infer from this evidence that Applicant did not report the earlier \nincident to Dr C. (evidence of this unalleged offense will not be used for \ndisqualification purposes, but I will consider it as it may relate to Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, the application of any mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person \nassessment).  [Decision at 3.]  \nOther than the evaluation submitted by Dr. C, Applicant submitted no counseling reports. \nHe asserted, however, that he has engaged in different types of counseling, to include pastoral, \nprofessional, and group.  Applicant submitted a statement from a member of his group counseling \nsessions who claimed to be aware of the allegations against Applicant and stated that Applicant \nhas not been involved in any other incidents.  The Judge found that, \u201c[b]ased upon this statement, \nit appears the author was unaware of Applicant\u2019s earlier act of peeping that was not discovered by \nauthorities, but admitted in his hearing testimony.\u201d Id. at 4.    \n2 \n\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant gave conflicting testimony regarding prior similar incidents, initially denying \nany prior incidents under cross-examination and then admitting the prior incident in response to a \nquestion from the Judge.

Id. at 5.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part \nbelow: \nApplicant was found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and of peeping, \nwhich occurred in a public retail store, raising security concerns under Adjudicative Guidelines D, \nJ, and E. \nApplicant\u2019s past actions are known and no longer serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, \nor duress.  However, no other mitigating condition fully applies under any of the three guidelines. \nAlthough the 2016 incident is somewhat remote in time, Applicant failed to disclose a similar \nincident to his psychologist, calling into question his credibility, his acceptance of responsibility, \nand his commitment to not engage in similar behavior in the future. Additionally, Applicant \ncontinues to engage in viewing pornography, which Dr. C believed was related to his voyeuristic \ntendences.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nletters of recommendations from his colleagues and his wife; his [military \nevaluations], awards, and his deployments; his counseling; and his personal \ncircumstances. I weighed these factors against his conviction for peeping on a \nminor female, his failure to disclose a similar incident one month before the charged \nincident, and his inconsistent and equivocal hearing testimony. [Id. at 10.] \nDiscussion \nThe crux of Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the Judge erred in several findings of \nfact and that those erroneous findings undermined the Judge\u2019s mitigation and whole person \nanalyses. Specifically, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant failed to \ndisclose the prior incident during his psychosexual evaluation; that Applicant gave conflicting \ntestimony regarding prior similar incidents; and that Applicant testified inconsistently about his \npornography habits.  We do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive. \nWe examine a Judge\u2019s disputed findings to see if they are supported by substantial \nevidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In \nconducting our review, we give deference to the credibility determinations of the Judge. Id. The \nBoard must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but \nalso whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from those findings, and whether the Judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfindings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. Although a Judge\u2019s \ncredibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging said determination on \nappeal has a heavy burden.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s disputed findings are consistent with the testimony and record that \nwas before him. For example, our review of Dr. C\u2019s report confirms that the Judge had ample \nreason to infer that Applicant did not disclose the earlier peeping incident to Dr. C, as the report \nclearly contemplates that there was only one incident. AE B. Similarly, our review of the \ntranscript establishes that the Judge had substantial evidence to find that Applicant was \ninconsistent or equivocal in responding both to questions about his continued consumption of \npornography and whether he had committed other acts of voyeurism similar to the charged offense. \nFor example, under cross-examination Applicant flatly denied continued viewing of pornography, \nthen admitted the same, and then evaded answering any questions about frequency. When asked \na direct question about the last time he viewed pornography, Applicant professed to not know the \nlast time, but later\u2014under questioning by the Judge\u2014admitted it was within the last year. Tr. at \n65\u201366, 69. \nThe Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable \ninferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. Moreover, the Judge had the \nopportunity to personally observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor when he testified at the hearing and could \nform impressions about the credibility of his testimony based on his assessment of Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor. Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s negative assessment of his credibility is not \nsufficient to meet his heavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 14, 2005). We find no reason to disturb the challenged findings, and we defer to the \nJudge\u2019s credibility determination that flowed from those findings.  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record \nevidence, failed to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law, and failed to establish that he should be granted any relief. The \nJudge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  \nThe decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988).

Her description of the event included the following details: she met Applicant at a bar while socializing with members of her new unit; he followed her outside when she went to smoke, asked to kiss her, grabbed her around the waist and tried to kiss her after she said no; and she put her hands on his chest and pushed him away. Applicant was not charged with any offenses arising from this incident.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 8, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On September 27, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Eric C. Price denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleges that Applicant groped a female colleague at a bar in \nor about June 2018 and that he groped and sexually assaulted a female colleague at her home in or \nabout March 2019. The same behavior was cross-alleged under Guideline J, in addition to an \nallegation that Applicant was discharged from the military in November 2020 under other than \nhonorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial.

Applicant admitted the allegation regarding his discharge from the \nmilitary and denied the other allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations. On \nappeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in his credibility assessment, rendering his adverse \ndecision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his early thirties and served in the military from 2010 to 2020. Deployed on \nmultiple occasions into combat operations, Applicant is highly decorated. He has an honorable \ndischarge from his initial term of service, which ended in 2017. In November 2020, as a result of \nan incident alleged in the SOR, Applicant was discharged from his second term of service under \nother than honorable conditions. \nThe SOR allegations arise from two separate incidents. In April 2019, a complaining \nwitness (CW1) stated to investigators that Applicant had grabbed her and attempted to kiss her \nwithout her consent in about June 2018. She initially disclosed the incident to her supervisor, as \nwell as two incidents with other male members of her unit, in explanation of why she sought a \ntransfer to another unit. Her description of the event included the following details: she met \nApplicant at a bar while socializing with members of her new unit; he followed her outside when \nshe went to smoke, asked to kiss her, grabbed her around the waist and tried to kiss her after she \nsaid no; and she put her hands on his chest and pushed him away. Applicant was not charged with \nany offenses arising from this incident. \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that he first met CW1 on that evening and that he followed \nher outside the bar, but he denied asking her to kiss and denied that he grabbed her or groped her. \nHe challenged her motives, noting that she failed to report the alleged incident until nine months \nlater and in the context of a reassignment request. Applicant submitted a letter from EH, a \nservicemember who served with Applicant and had been his roommate from late 2016 to early \n2020, which stated: \u201cI am aware of the allegations made against [Applicant] and I believe them to \nbe false in nature. I believe [Applicant] fell victim to someone who accused multiple other people \nof similar allegations and that [Applicant] told the whole truth during his testimonies.\u201d Decision \nat 4 (citing Answer at Ex. 9); Applicant Exhibit G at 91-92. \nIn May 2019, investigators interviewed another complaining witness (CW2), who reported \nthat Applicant groped and sexually assaulted her in March 2019. Her account to investigators \nincluded the following details: Applicant asked if he could stay at her residence after a night out, \nand she agreed; CW2 vomited in a taxi while they were enroute back to her residence and fell \nwhile exiting the vehicle; while she was in the bathroom preparing to shower, Applicant entered \nthe room naked, grabbed her and fondled her; she repeatedly told him to stop; and her roommate \n[Roommate] told Applicant to leave and escorted him out of the residence. \nRoommate\u2019s statement to investigators included the following details: on the evening in \nissue, she saw CW2 at their residence, intoxicated and leaning on Applicant; Roommate helped \nCW2 to the shower, where CW2 told her that she did not want Applicant at the house; Roommate \nasked Applicant to leave, but he walked into the bathroom and locked the door; Roommate heard \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCW2 tell Applicant to leave, the bathroom door opened, and Applicant ran out of the bathroom \nnude; when CW2 returned to the bathroom to vomit, Applicant followed her and locked the door; \nRoommate again heard CW2 ask Applicant to leave, and Roommate escorted him out of the \nresidence. \u201cCW2 later told Roommate that \u2018she never felt so close [to] being raped,\u2019 and that \nApplicant had picked her up, placed her on the counter, and attempted to perform oral sex on her.\u201d \nDecision at 4 (quoting Government Exhibit 2 at 2). \nAt hearing, Applicant denied any nonconsensual sexual behavior with CW2 and stated that \nCW2\u2019s statement to investigators was untruthful. His testimony about the evening included the \nfollowing details: CW2 asked him to spend the night at her residence after several hours of drinking \nat a party; she exited the taxi to vomit on the way to her residence; she stumbled while exiting the \nvehicle; she went into the bathroom alone upon arriving at her residence; he decided to go home \nafter a short time; when he went to say goodbye to CW2 in the bathroom, she opened the door \nnaked, invited him to join her in a shower, and helped him undress; CW2 suggested they go to her \nbedroom to avoid Roommate hearing; they encountered Roommate while naked and enroute to \nCW2\u2019s bedroom; Roommate scolded them both and suggested he leave, and he agreed because \nCW2 was drunk. \nApplicant sent an apologetic text after he left the residence. At hearing, he explained that \nhe did so \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t want their kissing and disrobing to negatively affect their friendship \nor relationship at work.\u201d Id. at 6. He had no explanation for why CW2 or Roommate would lie \nabout the incident. He claimed that CW2 had broken up with her boyfriend shortly before the \nincident and possibly reconciled after she made the allegations against him. Although Applicant \nalleged that there were inconsistencies between CW2\u2019s and Roommate\u2019s statements in other \ndocuments, he did not specify what those discrepancies were or submit any corroborating \nevidence. \nIn October 2019, Applicant was charged with offenses arising from the incident at CW2\u2019s \nresidence, including one sexual act and one attempted sexual act upon a female servicemember, as \nwell as unlawful entry and indecent exposure. At his request, Applicant was administratively \ndischarged from the military in November 2020 in lieu of trial by court-martial. His request for \nthe administrative discharge\u2014characterized as under other than honorable conditions\u2014did not \ninclude an admission of guilt. Applicant stated that the administrative discharge enabled him to \nmaintain veteran\u2019s benefits based upon his previous period of honorable service and allowed him \nto avoid the risks associated with a possible court-martial conviction. \nApplicant submitted numerous character references and letters of recommendation from \nservice members, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Those letters attest to \u201chis honesty, integrity, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, patriotism, dependability, work ethic, professionalism, leadership, \nhandling of classified information, adherence to rules and regulations, commitment to U.S. \nnational security and his mission, and superior performance in combat that saved lives of friendly \nforces.\u201d Id. at 7. Additionally, many of the letters explicitly recommend approval of his continued \naccess to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part. \nThe statements in evidence from CW1, CW2, and Roommate provide substantial evidence \nthat Applicant sexually assaulted and groped CW2 and that he grabbed CW1 around the waist and \nattempted to kiss her without consent. Applicant presented no evidence that rebutted those \nstatements and no testimony or evidence that corroborated his denials of nonconsensual contact \nwith either CW1 or CW2. \u201cThe evidence in support of his denials of any criminal conduct was \nlimited to his testimony, support from his favorable character evidence, his military service, and \n[EH\u2019s] opinion that the allegations were false.\u201d Id. at 10. \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s claims that CW2 opened her bathroom door, invited him \nto join her in the shower, and then consensually engaged in sexual activity with him \ncredible. His claims are unsupported by other evidence and directly contradicted by \nCW2\u2019s and Roommate\u2019s statements. CW2, Applicant\u2019s close friend and colleague, \ndetailed his nonconsensual sexual misconduct. CW2\u2019s statement was corroborated, \nin large part, by Roommate, who also provided her own account . . . . His assertions \nthat CW2 may have falsely accused him of sexual misconduct because of her break\u00ad\nup and subsequent reconciliation with a boyfriend, and concerns that her roommate \nwould negatively judge her for engaging in sexual activity with Applicant were \nneither corroborated nor credible. \n. \n. \n. \nI also find CW1\u2019s rendition of events more credible than Applicant\u2019s. . . . CW1 said \nthat: (1) while outside the bar Applicant asked to kiss her and she twice told him \nno; (2) he then \u201cgrabbed [her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her;\u201d (3) she \npushed him away and he went back inside the bar, and (4) that when she \nsubsequently saw him around the squadron \u201c[he] avoided her at all costs.\u201d \nApplicant denied any physical contact with CW1, except possibly a friendly \ngoodbye hug at the end a collegial evening and did not recount any conversations \nor recall any other social interaction with her though he was \u201csure [they] flew \ntogether, deployed together and so on.\u201d (Tr. 57, 62-63) His lack of recollection of \nprofessional or social interaction with CW1 in the 10-month period they served \ntogether after first meeting . . . is less credible than her claims that he \ninappropriately touched her outside the bar and avoided her thereafter. I gave little \nweight to [EH\u2019s] opinions because he provided no evidentiary basis for his belief \nthat CW1 lied about the offense and because there is no evidence Applicant \nprovided a statement or testimony regarding the misconduct alleged at any time \nbefore [EH\u2019s] November 2021 letter. \nAs discussed above, I did not find Applicant\u2019s denials that he committed the \nmisconduct alleged in the SOR credible. I found his testimony and demeanor at the \nhearing to be unconvincing and inconsistent with someone who was reliably telling \nthe truth. . . . I found his minimization of visible manifestations of CW2\u2019s \nintoxication, fanciful rendition of their sexual interaction, and explanations for his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nattempts to apologize to her unconvincing. I also found his demeanor and answers \nto questions about his relationship and contact with CW1 after the alleged incident \nwith her somewhat nonresponsive and evasive. \n. \n. \n. \nStatements from CW1, CW2, and Roommate, corroborated in part by Applicant, \nprovided substantial, reliable evidence that he committed the criminal conduct \nalleged in the SOR. Notwithstanding his strong character evidence and combat \nrecord, Applicant\u2019 testimony was insufficient to overcome the evidence against \nhim. [Id. at 10-12.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact but contends \ninstead that the Judge erred in his credibility determinations in that he \u201cdid not find credibility to \nmyself or to my statements made during the hearing,\u201d but \u201cfound that the statements made . . . by \nboth CW 1 and CW 2 were fully credible with no supporting reasoning or documentation \nvalidating their credibility.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant highlights that he submitted numerous \ncharacter references \u201cfrom members in high standing within the Military and Federal government\u201d \nwho themselves hold clearances. Id. Those character references, he argues, should \u201chold some \nweight when attempting to determine my credibility in this case,\u201d but the Judge \u201cseemingly \ndismissed them all together.\u201d Id. We are not persuaded by this argument. \nFirst, we give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nAlthough a judge\u2019s credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging it \nhas a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJul. 14, 2005). \nSecond, contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, the record confirms that the Judge considered \nthe character references, as his decision refers to them on multiple occasions. See Decision at 7, \n10, 12. Indeed, the Judge explicitly acknowledges the character references as weighing on the issue \nof credibility. After highlighting that Applicant\u2019s \u201cfavorable character evidence\u201d buttressed his \ndenials of any criminal conduct, the Judge later concluded that \u201c(n)otwithstanding his strong \ncharacter evidence and combat record, Applicant\u2019s testimony was insufficient to overcome the \nevidence against him.\u201d Id. at 10, 12. In sum, the record contains ample evidence that the Judge \nconsidered all evidence submitted on the issue of credibility, to include the numerous letters \nattesting to Applicant\u2019s character. \nThird, turning to Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge found CW1\u2019s and CW2\u2019s statements \ncredible \u201cwith no supporting reasoning,\u201d we note that the Judge articulated in considerable detail \nwhy he found CW1\u2019s and CW2\u2019s renditions of the incidents more credible than Applicant\u2019s, as \nevident in the excerpts above from the Judge\u2019s analysis. Presented with conflicting evidence on \nwhether Applicant engaged in nonconsensual acts with CW1 and CW2, the Judge had the \nopportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his testimony, assess the credibility of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony on the two incidents, and weigh Applicant\u2019s denials of wrongdoing in light \nof the record evidence as a whole. Giving due deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determination, \nthe record evidence provides a legally sufficient basis for the Judge to conclude that CW1\u2019s and \nCW2\u2019s statements regarding the incidents were more credible than Applicant\u2019s and that Applicant \ncommitted the acts against CW1 and CW2 as alleged. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-03248 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2005). Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s negative assessment of his \ncredibility is not sufficient to meet his heavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n05072 at 5. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision. Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful \nerror or that he should be granted any relief on appeal. A review of the record shows the Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).
