Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 26, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 10, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant  raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him,\nwhether the Judge erred in considering non-alleged matters, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has been working in the defense industry since 2004.  He holds a master\u2019s degree. \nIn 2016, he downloaded, without authorization and in contravention of a non-disclosure agreement,\ncompany proprietary information onto an encrypted thumb drive and took the thumb drive with him\nafter leaving that company\u2019s employment.1  Shortly thereafter, he began working for a competitor\nof his former company.  He wanted to take the information because knew he would be working on\nthe same engineering technology in his new position and planned to use the information in question\nas a reference.  He stated the information was for his personal use, and he had no intention of sharing\nit with anyone else.  He indicated that he became aware of the severity of his actions when he\nreceived letters from the FBI and his former company.  An internal investigation concluded that he\nviolated company rules and regulations and committed a security violation.    \nApplicant claimed \u201che made an honest, naive, and very foolish mistake\u201d in taking the\nproprietary information and did not understand the ramifications of his actions.  Decision at 3.  A\ncounselor who provided him psychotherapy after he lost his security clearance in 2009 indicated he\nwould never knowingly damage an employer\u2019s privileged information.  His previously revoked\nsecurity clearance was reinstated in 2014.  He submitted letters from other individuals who attested\nto his good character.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant committed a serious security violation.  His downloading of proprietary\ninformation was deliberate.  He knew or should have known such conduct violated company rules\nand regulations.  \u201cFurthermore, he has a history of negligence and misconduct.  His security\nclearance was first revoked in 2009.  In 2014, Applicant, made some very improper decisions that\nhave now negatively impacted his current clearance.\u201d  Decision at 5.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \n1 Applicant also had a covenant not to compete that precluded him from taking technology from his former\ncompany.   Decision at 3.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nApplicant claims the Judge was biased against him.  Specifically, he stated that the Judge\nacted in a manner that made him \u201cfeel like she departed from her role as impartial arbitrator.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1.  He also stated that his wife who attended the hearing shared the same sentiment. \nExcept for the assignments of error addressed below, Applicant does not point to any specific\ncomment or action by the Judge that caused him to believe she was biased against him.2  There is\na rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome\nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-02364 at 2 (App.\nBd. Apr. 4, 2011).  From our review of the record, we find nothing to support Applicant\u2019s contention\nthat Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  \nApplicant raises two issues related to Government Exhibit (GE) 3, a Joint Personnel\nAdjudication System (JPAS) Incident History.  First, Applicant contends the Judge erred in the\nDecision by stating that he did not object to GE 3.  The transcript supports his contention that he\nobjected to the relevance of that exhibit at the hearing.  The Judge overruled his objection and\nadmitted GE 3 into evidence.  Tr. 20-21.  Besides entries addressing Applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct,\nGE 3 also has entries indicating that his SCI access was suspended in 2009 and later revoked.  He\nargues the information about his 2009 SCI access suspension and revocation was irrelevant.  We do\nnot find his argument persuasive.  The JPAS Incident History is a Federal Government record that\ncontains relevant information about an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  We conclude the\nJudge committed no error in admitting the JPAS Incident History into evidence.3  \nSecond, Applicant also contends the Judge erred in considering that his security clearance\nwas revoked in 2009.  He argues that consideration of that prior suspension/revocation of his\nsecurity clearance was unfair and prejudicial.  It is well established, however,  that a Judge may\nconsider unfavorable non-alleged matters for certain limited purposes, such as (a) in assessing an\napplicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or\nchanged circumstances; (c) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful\nrehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-person concept.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369\nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  We find no reason to conclude the Judge considered non-alleged\nmatters for inappropriate purposes.  \nApplicant also challenges that Judge\u2019s conclusion that he \u201cmade some very improper\ndecisions\u201d in 2014 that negatively impacts his current clearance eligibility.  He argues that nothing\nnegative happened in 2014.  The record supports Applicant\u2019s contention.  This error, however, is\n2 In his appeal brief, Applicant notifies us for the first time that he did not receive a copy of the transcript of\nthe hearing.  More specifically, he did not notify us that he had not received the transcript in either his Notice of Appeal\nor subsequent requests for appeal brief filing extensions.  His appeal brief merely mentions that he did not receive the\ntranscript and does not raise that matter as an issue for which he is seeking any relief.    \n3 We also note that, in addition to GE 3, Applicant\u2019s testimony and other evidence reflected his security\nclearance was suspended in 2009, later revoked, and was reinstated in 2014.  Tr. 34, 45-53, 69, GE 1 and 2, and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and D. \n3\n\nharmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).4  Applicant\u2019s conduct in wrongfully taking proprietary information\nwhen he departing a company\u2019s employment to work for a competitor in 2016 was more than a\nsufficient basis for denying his security clearance eligibility.       \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence.  He argues, for example, that he is responsible and trustworthy.  However, a party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d\n4 It appears the Judge committed a drafting error in stating 2014 instead of 2016.  \n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nFebruary 19, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  On January 10, 2018, the SOR\nwas amended by withdrawing some Guideline F allegations and adding Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) allegations. Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 24, 2018, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Caroline E. Heintzelman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 57 year old, has worked off and on for defense contractors since the early\n1990s.  He has married twice and has three children.  In 2011, he was fired from a company for\nimproperly charging about 530 hours of work to Government contracts.  Although he received\ntraining regarding timecard accounting, he claims he did not know he improperly charged hours to\nthe Government.  He contends that he kept personal time records and only failed to account for 60\nhours.   Due to his conduct, he was barred from working on Executive Branch contracts from May\n2012 to March 2015.  He was given an opportunity to present evidence challenging the debarment,\nbut did not provide matters in opposition.\nIn February 2012, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) at another\ncompany in which he did not disclose his prior employment termination.  He indicated the he left\nthat job due to downsizing.  He also failed to disclose that he had two debts over 120 days\ndelinquent and had a vehicle recently repossessed.  While he testified that an agency hired to help\nhim complete the SCA failed to disclose negative information in that form, he also acknowledged\nhe knew the information was not truthful when he signed it.  \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had 14 delinquent debts totaling about $42,000.  With\nthe exception of three debts, he admitted each of them.  He claims he paid about $1,000 toward some\nto the debts, but provided no proof of the payments.  His recent credit reports reflect two new\ndelinquent debts totaling over $800.  He and his wife earn about $227,000 annually.  Applicant\n\u201cblames his financial struggles on his unexpected unemployment in 2011.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Since\nthen, he experienced periods of unemployment, and he and his wife maintained separate households.\nIn 2014, he purchased one vehicle and leased another that resulted in monthly payments of almost\n$1,600. \nWhen his first marriage ended in divorce, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which\nincluded credit card debt and the balance owed on a repossessed vehicle.   A 2004 JPAS entry\nreflected Applicant misused a company credit card by making personal purchases totaling over\n$4,500.  He testified he only charged $200 and was unaware he could not use the card for personal\n2\n\npurchases.  At the time of the hearing, he had not filed his 2017 Federal and state tax returns and\nowed the IRS about $50,000 in past-due taxes for 2011-2016.  He has been making monthly\npayments to the IRS of $690 since 2017.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant provided no proof of payments to resolve his delinquent debts.  His periods of\nunemployment were not shown to be circumstances beyond his control.  His financial problems\nreflect poor self-control, lack of judgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nApplicant admitted the Guideline E allegations, but disputed the number of hours he\nimproperly charged to the Government.  He did not contest his 2012 debarment.  He provided false\ninformation in his 2012 SCA.  His dishonest behavior is not infrequent.  At the hearing, he\nminimized his behavior and failed to accept responsibility for his actions.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \nAs best we can discern, Applicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s conclusions that he falsified his\nSCA by failing to disclose he was fired from a job in 2011 and had reportable delinquent debts.  The\nSOR did not allege that Applicant falsified his SCA.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s\nfindings about Applicant falsifying his SCA were based on substantial evidence or constituted \nreasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  A Judge may consider conduct not alleged for purposes such as\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation, assessing credibility, or applying the whole-person\nconcept.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  We find no basis for\nconcluding the Judge considered non-alleged conduct in an inappropriate manner.   \nApplicant further contends the Judge erred in concluding his periods of unemployment were\nnot conditions beyond his control.  In doing so, he states, \u201cIt is because, after the termination in\n2012, my employment has been very restricted and very unstable, and unemployment occurred very\noften due to my clearance status.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 8.  Since Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment\ncan be traced back to his wrongful conduct, we find no basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s challenged\nconclusion. \nApplicant makes a number of other arguments that are, in essence, a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  For example, he contends that the number of hours he improperly charged\nthe Government was significantly inflated, that a number of years have passed since that incident\nhappened, that his unexpected firing caused his financial problems, and that he is in the process of\nresolving his tax problems.  Additionally, he challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he minimized\nhis behavior and failed to fully accept responsibility.  These arguments, however, are insufficient\n3\n\nto show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).   \nFinally, Applicant argues, if he is unable to work, he cannot resolve his debts.  But, it is well\nestablished that the adverse impact that an unfavorable decision may have on an applicant is not a\nrelevant or material consideration in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 14-04202 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015).   \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJane M. Reynolds, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\n\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 23, 2017, and\nOctober 17, 2018, the SOR was amended.1 On December 17, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He retired honorably from the\nmilitary.  He has been married twice and has five children.  He is separated from his wife and resides\nwith his special-needs child.  He and his wife are trying to reconcile.  \nThe SOR alleges four financial concerns (Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed in 2016; Chapter\n7 bankruptcy discharge granted in 2017; Federal tax debt of about $45,700 for 2009 and 2011\nthrough 2015; and failure to file Federal tax returns on time for 2009 through 2015) and cross-\nalleges two alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns (discharge of a firearm from a\nmoving vehicle after consuming alcohol in 2011 for which he was sentenced to 180 days\nincarceration with 165 days suspended; and reckless handling of a firearm, swearing in public, and\npublic intoxication in 2015 for which he was sentenced to 12 months probation).  Applicant admitted\neach SOR allegation.  \nIn 2016, Applicant filed his past-due tax returns, and the IRS determined he owed about\n$35,000 in back taxes.  In April 2018, he agreed with the IRS to a payment plan of $425 a month. \nHe is current with the IRS payment plan.  \nApplicant consumed alcohol to deal with his problems and stress.  He sought substance abuse\ncounseling.  In 2015, he began consulting with a psychologist.  He last consumed alcohol the day\nbefore his mother\u2019s funeral in the fall of 2018.  The day before the hearing he began a Veteran\u2019s\nAffairs (VA) substance abuse rehabilitation program.  He recognizes that he needs alcohol treatment\nand does not intend to consume alcohol in the future.  The psychologist believes Applicant has taken\nthe counseling to heart and is developing positive coping skills.  \nWhile the receipt of a bankruptcy discharge does not amount to a good-faith resolution of\ndebts, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings in 2016 and 2017 do not create a security concern.  Even\nthough he has filed his delinquent tax returns and is now paying his past-due taxes, his tax\ndeficiencies do not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons\n1 The SOR amendment on October 17, 2018, withdrew the earlier amendment.  \n2\n\ngranted access to classified information.  He did not provide sufficient evidence to show his tax\nproblems were resolved, under control, or unlikely to recur.  He has not acted responsibly and\nreliably.\n    \nApplicant was arrested twice for firing a weapon after consuming alcohol. He entered a VA\nsubstance abuse program the day before the hearing.  He has not presented sufficient evidence to\nestablish a pattern of abstinence to overcome his alcohol problems.  His criminal conduct did not\nhappen under unusual circumstances and the last offense happened only three years ago.  \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  For example, he argues that he filed his delinquent tax returns and is making a good-faith\neffort to pay his taxes through a repayment plan.  He also notes that he is receiving alcohol\ntreatment, claims he is on his way to being rehabilitated, and maintains he should be given credit\nfor dealing with his problem.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n23, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 26, 2018, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  As amended, the SOR alleges\nthat Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2014, that he had four delinquent\nmedical debts totaling about $4,000, that he had delinquent tax debts totaling about $13,000, that\nhis wife is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) who resides in the United States, and\nthat his parents-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  \nApplicant received an honorable discharge from the U.S. military in 2000.  From 2001 to late\n2009, he worked for a U.S. Government agency.  In 2007, he also started a company and mistakenly\nbelieved his investments in the company could be declared as losses on his  income tax returns.  In\n2014, he learned that the IRS considered those investments as \u201chobby losses\u201d that could  not be\nrecouped until the company generated income.  Due to the disallowed losses, Applicant incurred an\nunpaid tax debt for 2011-2014.  With the economic decline in 2007 and 2008, he also sustained\nlosses on rental properties he had purchased.  \nWhile undergoing surgery in a foreign country in 2009, he suffered a \u201cmedical\nmisadventure\u201d that left him physically unable to perform his duties.  Decision at 3.  He retained\ncounsel to pursue a medical malpractice claim and, on the advice of counsel, remained in the foreign\ncountry to participate in the case.  He went into a leave-without-pay status after expending his\naccumulated leave.  Later that year, he resigned from his job when the U.S. Government agency\nproposed removing him from that employment.  He then used retirement funds to pay for living\nexpenses and returned to school to pursue a new career.   \nApplicant\u2019s medical malpractice case took longer than expected to resolve.  Despite having\nreceived disability payments for a portion of 2011, he started feeling financial pressure and used\ncredit cards to fund living expenses.  His injury and unemployment caused him to fall behind on his\n2\n\nmortgages, educational loans, and credit cards.  In March 2011, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.1  In\nmid-2011, he began working for a defense contractor.\nIn early 2014, Applicant received a $380,000 medical malpractice settlement.2  In March\n2014, he received a bankruptcy discharge that did not absolve him of his tax debt or educational\nloans.  Regarding the malpractice settlement, \u201cApplicant estimates he spent $62,000 paying off his\neducational loans, invested $70,000 in his business, and paid $15,000 for his continuing education. \nWith the $20,000 he gave to his father (for helping Applicant out in tough times), Applicant has\nfuzzily explained where the remaining $203,000 went.\u201d  Decision at 4.  \nApplicant continued working for defense contractors until he was laid off in late 2014.  He\nremained unemployed until he obtained his current job in late 2015.  He and his wife earn about\n$134,000 annually.  He provided proof that he paid a $52 medical debt in 2016.  In that year, he also\nentered into a repayment agreement with the IRS for his 2011-2014 taxes.  He provided proof of the\nrequired $212 monthly IRS payments from April through August 2016.  He did not document\npayment of the three remaining medical debts that appear to have aged off his credit reports.    \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in the PRC, attended college in the United States, and then\nworked in the PRC before returning to the United States following her engagement to Applicant. \nThey married in 2016.  She became a permanent U.S. resident in late 2016.  Her parents as well as\nher extended family members are resident citizens of the PRC.  Her father works at the district level\nof the PRC Government.  Her mother is retired.  Applicant communicates regularly with her mother\n1 In his bankruptcy petition (i.e., the Statement of Financial Affairs), Applicant checked the \u201cNone\u201d box\npertaining to the following request: \u201cList all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party\nwithin one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case.\u201d  Government Exhibit (GE) 5.  \u201cSection 541\nof the Bankruptcy Code provides that virtually all of a debtor\u2019s assets, including causes of action belonging to the debtor\nat the commencement of the bankruptcy case, vest in the bankruptcy estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.  11\nU.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1); In re Swift, 129 F.3d at 795; COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00a7 541.08.  Thus, a trustee as\nrepresentative of the bankruptcy estate, is the real party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes\nof action belonging to the estate once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.\u201d  Kane v. National Union Fire Insurance\nCo. 535 F.3d 380, 385 (5th Cir. 2008). \n2 The record does not reflect whether Applicant notified the bankruptcy court or trustee of his malpractice\nsettlement before the bankruptcy discharge was issued.  The record, however, contains the following exchange:\n[Department Counsel]:  Okay. When you received it [the malpractice settlement], your bankruptcy\nwasn\u2019t fully discharged yet.  Is that correct?\n[Applicant]:  Correct.\n[Department Counsel]:  Okay.  Did you consider using any of the monies from your settlement to\nrepay the lenders you owed under that bankruptcy as opposed to continuing with the discharge?\n[Applicant]:  My trustee just wanted to close it out.  Her name is . . . . [ Tr. at 124.]  \n3\n\nand seldomly with her father.  She describes her extended family members as farmers and factory\nworkers.  \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government with a poor record for human rights.  It is an\nactive collector of U.S. economic intelligence and technology and engages in espionage against the\nUnited States.   Its intelligence services and private industry frequently seek to exploit Chinese\ncitizens or persons with family ties to the PRC to steal state secrets.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant meets most of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.  He\nexperienced financial problems due to conditions beyond his control -- including a medical\nmisadventure that cost him a well-established career and periods of unemployment from December\n2009 to June 2011 and from October 2014 to December 2015 -- and largely dealt with his finances\nresponsibly.   His financial difficulties are not recent and are not likely to recur.  He promptly paid\nhis education loans once he received the malpractice settlement and entered into a repayment plan\nwith the IRS.  He was in contact with creditors well before the SOR (although the Judge noted there\nis no evidence of Applicant\u2019s efforts to contact the creditors of the aged-off medical debts) and made\na good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  Given his actions, the unpaid debts have little security\nsignificance.    \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her parents create a potential heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, but only because of the rebuttable presumption that\nhe has ties of affection and obligation to his wife and to his in-law through his wife.  His wife is\neffectively beyond the reach of the PRC.  She is a permanent U.S. resident and has no apparent\nconnection to the PRC Government.  These connections are too attenuated to raise any security risks. \nDiscussion\nDepartment Counsel argues that the record in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable mitigation analysis under Guidelines F and B.  More specifically, she contends that the\nJudge did not consider important aspects of the case and his analysis runs contrary to the weight of\nthe record evidence.  Most of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have merit.3\n3 Department Counsel makes an argument that the Appeal Board has repeatedly rejected, i.e., \u201cWith respect\nto resolution of delinquent taxes, Mitigating Conditions 20(d) and 20(g) must be read in concert and harmony with the\noverall parameters of analysis set forth by the Appeal Board.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 27.  This is not accurate.  As we have\npreviously explained, \u201cThe Appeal Board and Hearing Office are creatures of the Directive.  While some analysis and\nprecedents might survive amendments to the Directive or guidelines, it is mistaken to believe that the guidelines are\nsomehow inferior to Appeal Board decisions.  More succinctly, the provision of the Directive, including the guidelines,\nare controlling.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4, n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018), ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4.\nn.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018), and, most recently, ISCR Case No. 17-00944 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2019).  The Reply\nBrief also notes that the Judge did not mention Mitigating Condition 20(g).  Reply Brief at 17.  Additionally, Department\nCounsel argues the Judge erred in finding Applicant \u201creceived disability payments for a portion of 2011\" when he\nactually received such payments dating back to 2009.  While that finding may not reflect the full picture of the disability\npayments that Applicant received, that finding is not erroneous.   \n4\n\n \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371, U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d   Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of\nthe national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nthe Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nrebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at\n3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;\nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs\ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference\nof opinion.  Id. at 4.\nDepartment Counsel challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s Guideline F conclusions.  For\nexample, she opposes the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant\u2019s debts are not recent.  She argues\nthat, while Applicant's tax and medical debts may have existed for years, those problems were still\nunresolved.  The ongoing nature of most of his alleged delinquent debts vitiates a conclusion that\nhis financial problems are not recent and, thus, they continue to impugn his trustworthiness and\nreliability.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10575 at 3(App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2008).  Department Counsel\nalso notes that Applicant testified that he could have returned to work \u201cmuch sooner\u201d than he did\nfollowing his medical misadventure,4 and she argues the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201clargely\ndealt with his finances responsibly\u201d is flawed.  She highlights that Applicant received the\nmalpractice settlement of $380,000 about one month before the bankruptcy court issued the debt\n4 Appeal Brief at 19, citing Tr. at 69.\n5\n\ndischarge order in March 2014.5  Between receipt of the settlement payment and the hearing,\nApplicant fully expended the settlement funds without paying his past-due taxes or delinquent\nmedical debts and can only account \u201cfuzzily\u201d for the expenditure of over $200,000 of those funds. \nHis expenditure of the funds on discretionary matters, such as expending about $70,000 on an\nendeavor that the IRS regards as a \u201chobby,\u201d instead of expending them on his delinquent financial\nobligations calls into question whether he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  Additionally,\nwhile Applicant established that he had an IRS installment agreement, he did not enter into that\nagreement until more than a year and a half after he submitted his security clearance application and\nmore than two years after he received the settlement payment.  The timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts\nat debt resolution is relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 14-03358 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015).  Furthermore, Department Counsel points out that\nApplicant did not provide proof he paid three of the alleged delinquent medical debts, which the\nJudge indicated had apparently aged off Applicant\u2019s credit report.  As we have stated in the past, the\naging off of debts from a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as\nto the disposition of such debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03907 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2018). \nDepartment Counsel further observes that Applicant failed to filed his Federal income tax returns\nfor 2009-2012 as required.  In his post-hearing submission, he provided his IRS tax transcripts that\nreveal his Federal tax returns for those years were not filed until May 2015.6  The Judge did not\nfactor Applicant\u2019s tax filing deficiencies into his mitigation analysis.  Viewed in its entirety, the\nrecord evidence significantly undercuts the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the alleged\nfinancial security concerns and, more specifically, that he acted responsibly in handling his financial\nproblems.\nDepartment Counsel also challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s conclusions in his Guideline\nB analysis.  At the outset, it merits noting the Judge apparently reached inconsistent conclusions\nregarding the application of Disqualifying Condition 7(a).7  On the one hand, the Judge concluded: \n5 The Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee\u2019s final report reflects that $235,972 of Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged\nwithout payment.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A.  \n6 AE W-Z.  In his security clearance application dated July, 28, 2014, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to the question\nthat asked: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law\nor ordinance?\u201d  GE 1.  Department Counsel calls into questions Applicant\u2019s testimony that the IRS contacted him in\nOctober or November 2014 regarding the disallowance of his 2011-2013 business expenses.  Department Counsel argues\nthat the IRS would have no basis to talk to him about those business expenses if he had not yet filed his income tax\nreturns for those years.  Appeal Brief at 29, citing Tr. at 134-135.  We also note that Applicant testified, \u201cI always filed\nmy taxes within the due date for the following year\u201d and \u201c . . . I have never not filed on time for any year that I actually\nhad W-2 income.\u201d  Tr. at 62 and 116, respectively.  On cross-examination, Applicant acknowledged that he did not file\nhis 2012 and 2013 tax returns until 2015 and he thought those delays had to do with his bankruptcy filing.  Tr. at 117-\n118.\n7 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(a) states, \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion[.]\u201d\n6\n\nIn this case, the Government established that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the\nPRC, residing in the U.S., her parents are resident citizens of the PRC, and these\ncircumstances create a potential heightened risk of exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u2014but only because of the rebuttable presumption\nthat Applicant has ties of affection and obligation to his wife, and to his in-laws\nthrough his wife.8\nOn the other hand, the Judge later concluded, \u201c[t]here is nothing in the circumstances of [Applicant\u2019s\nin-laws] being in the PRC or in [his wife\u2019s] contacts with them, to heighten the risk that Applicant\ncould be impelled or compelled to provide protected information to the PRC.\u201d9  The Judge does not\nexplain how the circumstances of the case can create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation when\nthere is \u201cnothing in the circumstances  . . . to heighten\u201d such a risk.10  The Judge erred in making\nthese contradictory conclusions.      \nDepartment Counsel persuasively challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\ncontacts with her parents are \u201cinfrequent,\u201d that Applicant \u201chas no connections whatsoever to the\nPRC[,]\u201d and Applicant\u2019s \u201cconnections are too attenuated to raise any security risks.\u201d  Decision at\n8.\n8 Decision at 8.  In his analysis, the Judge twice uses the term \u201cpotential heightened risk.\u201d  As reflected in the\nprevious footnote, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) does not contain the word \u201cpotential.\u201d  By using the term \u201cpotential\nheightened risk,\u201d it is unclear whether the Judge was attempting to conclude that Disqualifying Condition 7(a) applied\nin some limited fashion.  If that was his intention, he did not do so in a clear and understandable manner.  The word\n\u201crisk\u201d is defined as \u201cthe chance of injury, damage, or loss; dangerous chance; hazard[;] . . . to expose to the chance of\ninjury, damage, or loss[.]\u201d  Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (3rd College Ed.)(1988) at 1159.  \u201cRisk\u201d encompasses  a\n\u201cpotential\u201d outcome.  Under Disqualifying Condition 7(a), \u201cheightened risk\u201d includes the \u201cpotential\u201d of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, etc.  We are unable to discern a meaningful distinction between the creation of a \u201cpotential\nheightened risk\u201d or a \u201cheightened risk,\u201d and are unsure what exactly the Judge meant by using that former term.  As we\nsaid in the past, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what\nfindings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 23, 2018).  If the Judge did conclude that the evidence established something short of the \u201cheightened risk\u201d\nin Disqualifying Condition 7(a), then he erred.  As summarized in footnote 11 below, the evidence established a\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d under that disqualifying condition.  \n9 Decision at 9.  To understand this quote in its context, the full paragraph is set forth below:\nAlthough the U.S. and the PRC are global competitors, and the PRC is an active collector of\nprotected U.S. information and commercial information, Applicant is not situated in a position where\nhe is likely to be pressured.  Examining Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the Government\u2019s evidence that\nthere was a potential heightened risk of foreign, exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion because of Applicant\u2019s marriage to his wife, now permanently resident in the U.S., is\nextremely thin.  He has never met his father-in-law; he met his mother-in-law for five days, with no\nconversation other than that brokered by his then fiancee.  Her contacts with her parents are routine\nand infrequent.  There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in the PRC or in her contacts with\nthem, to heighten the risk that Applicant could be impelled or compelled to provide protected\ninformation to the PRC.  I find Guideline B for Applicant.\n10 A Judge is tasked with resolving apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at\n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014). \n7\n\nOf note, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s wife communicates with her mother about once or twice\na week by text and about once a month by telephone.  This finding is at odds with his conclusion\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s contacts with her parents are \u201cinfrequent.\u201d  Additionally, the record contains\nsubstantial evidence to establish the Guideline B allegations and the resultant security concerns\nunder Disqualifying Condition 7(a).11  As we have stated elsewhere, the Directive presumes there\nis a nexus or rational connection between proven circumstances under any of the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility.  Direct or objective evidence of nexus in not required.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2018).  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts to the PRC through his wife and her parents are too attenuated to raise security concerns\nis not sustainable.   \nWe also note the Judge asked the following questions in his analysis:\nHow is the PRC to bring pressure on a retired accountant and a local government\nconsultant, through their daughter, who has no professional background of interest\nto the PRC?  How is the PRC expected to pressure (or even find) the daughter to\npressure her to pressure Applicant to provide protected information?12 \nThe practical effect of those questions is to require Department Counsel to prove affirmatively the\nmethods the PRC uses to exploit PRC citizens or persons with family ties to the PRC.  The Directive\ndoes not require the Government to prove such matters to raise Guideline B security concerns. \nDepartment Counsel need only prove controverted facts in the SOR allegations.13 Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14.  Once the SOR allegations are admitted or proven, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nmitigate the resulting security concerns.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  By asking those questions, the Judge\nerred in placing the burden on the Government to prove matters that the Directive does not require. \nFurthermore, as it happens, the Judge need only have referred back to Page 5 of his decision to find\nthe answers to his questions.  There he would read his own findings that: \u201cThe PRC has a poor\nrecord with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices include arbitrary\narrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners.  The PRC engages\n11 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018) (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019).  The evidence that Applicant\u2019s wife was a citizen of the PRC; that her parents\nwere citizens and residents of the PRC; that she became a permanent U.S. resident about seven months before the\nhearing; that she maintains regular contact with her mother; that her father works for the PRC Government; and that the\nPRC Government is an active collector of U.S. protected information, engages in espionage against the United States,\nand frequently seeks to exploit PRC citizens or persons with family ties to the PRC to steal state secrets sufficiently\nestablished a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, etc. under Disqualifying Condition 7(a). \n12 Decision at 8.\n13 The allegations under Guideline B were amended (SOR \u00b6 2.a was modified and SOR \u00b6 2.b was added)  just\nbefore closing arguments were made.   Applicant was not asked to admit or deny the amended SOR allegations. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated, \u201cYour Honor, I think that [the SOR amendments] accurately reflects what the\nevidence was in the record, so no objection.\u201d  Tr. at 140-141.  \n8\n\nin espionage against the United States and is one of the two most active collectors of U.S. economic\nintelligence and technology.\u201d  \n  \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider\nimportant aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore,\nwe conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard. \n9\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nApril 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\n\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n22, 2018, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add allegations under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) as well as an additional allegation under Guideline E.  On February 7, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge was biased; whether\nApplicant was denied due process; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 58 years old, has a history of alcohol-related incidents and problems in the\nworkplace.  In about 1978 to 1979, he was arrested twice for driving under the influence (DUI). \nDuring an interview in 1987, he stated he was fined more that $100 for one DUI and could not recall\nthe amount of the fine for the other.  At the hearing, he could not remember being arrested for DUI\nduring that period but eventually conceded he was arrested as alleged.  Later, he again stated he\ncould not recall those incidents.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s testimony and statements about this and other\nincidents were evasive, inconsistent, and not credible.\u201d  Decision at 2.  \nIn 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with drunk driving and speeding. A military\npolice report of the incident reflects his blood alcohol content measured \u201c12% and 13%.\u201d1  He pled\nguilty to reckless driving, paid a $200 fine, and had his driver\u2019s license suspended.   In 2007, he was\ncharged with public swearing/intoxication.  He paid a fine and the charge was dismissed.  In 2013,\nhe was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).  He pled guilty to reckless\ndriving and was sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), probation for 12 months, a fine, and a\nrestricted driver\u2019s license.  In a later background interview, he stated the 2013 arrest was an isolated\nincident and denied ever being charged with any other alcohol-related offenses.  In his SOR\nresponse, he also stated, \u201cthis was my first and only offense in my entire driving history . . . .  I\nemphasize that this was my first offense, at that time, in my entire driving history.\u201d  Decision at 3,\nquoting from SOR Response.2  At the hearing, he testified that he did not intend to be dishonest with\nthose comments and thought the investigation was limited to the past seven years.  In 2014, he was\ncharged with reckless driving: improper brakes, and was found guilty of improper control/driving. \nHe attributed the last offense to stopping abruptly when a car cut in front of him while he was\nreaching for sunglasses.  \nIn 2007, Applicant was terminated from a job when multiple pornographic images were\ndiscovered on his network drive.  He claims he brought in a CD from home and accidently loaded\nthose images while he was copying other files.  \u201cHe stated that he was terminated the next day, \u2018on\nthe same day that [he] had planned to resign.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 4.  He provided a similar but slightly\ndifferent account during a 2009 background investigation. \n1 Decision at 2.  The military police report reflects Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content was \u201c.12% and .13%.\u201d\n2 Of note, Applicant submitted his initial SOR response on May 24, 2018, about four months before the SOR\nwas amended to add other alcohol-related driving incidents.  \n2\n\nIn 2013, Applicant received a written reprimand for violating company policy when he\ndownloaded a file from his personal email account that contained multiple usernames and passwords\nfor DoD accounts and other personal information.  At that time, he was warned of potential\nconsequences for future security incidents.  Later that year, he plugged a personal phone into his\nwork computer and immediately removed it when he was told he was violating security rules.  About\na month later, he commented to the person next to him during a work meeting that, if he brought a\nfirearm, he could take out the entire leadership or a bomb could do the same.  He denied making a\nthreat and meant the comment as an observation about a lack of security.  \n \nThe Judge determined that two of the Guideline E allegations were duplicative, found in\nfavor of Applicant on one of them, and also concluded the allegation concerning the threatening\ncomment was not proven by substantial evidence.  The Judge further concluded that Applicant\u2019s\ninconsistent and contradictory testimony about his arrests are not worthy of belief and determined\nthe remaining security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and judgment were\nunmitigated. \nDiscussion\nBias Issue\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge \u201cbecame angered with me and extremely\nintimidating for not recalling (incorrect count of two DUI\u2019s) and he did not allow me to explain why\nI felt the information was incorrect.\u201d  He further asserts that he felt the Judge \u201cbullied\u201d him into\nagreeing with a response when he was not comfortable with it.  Appeal Brief at 1.  These contentions\napparently pertain to Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding allegation SOR \u00b6 2.a that asserted he was\narrested and charged twice with DUI between 1978 and 1979.3  To the extent that Applicant is\ncontending the Judge was biased against him, we note there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge\nis impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of\npersuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018)(citing,\nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-556 (1994) for the proposition that \u201cexpressions of\nimpatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, even anger\u201d do not establish bias.  \u201cA judge\u2019s ordinary\nefforts at courtroom administration\u2014even a stern and short-tempered judge\u2019s ordinary efforts at\ncourtroom administration\u2014remain immune.\u201d).  From our review of the record, we conclude there\nis no basis for Applicant\u2019s assertions.  See, e.g., Tr. at 103-110.  While the Judge interrupted\nApplicant\u2019s testimony to ask pointed questions, his questioning of Applicant was not inappropriate,\nand he provided Applicant ample opportunity to explain himself.  Furthermore, Applicant was\nrepresented at the hearing.  At no time during the segment of the hearing in question did Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel object to the Judge\u2019s questions or conduct.  Applicant\u2019s assertions are not sufficient to rebut\nthe presumption the Judge was impartial.  \nDue Process Issue\n3 SOR \u00b6 2.a states, \u201cBetween approximately 1978 and 1979, you were arrested on two occasions and charged\nwith Driving Under the Influence.\u201d \n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also contends that he was denied the opportunity to present some\nevidence.  His appeal brief and Department Counsel\u2019s reply brief contain documents that are not in\nthe record.  Generally, we cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The\nAppeal Board, however, can consider new evidence to address the threshold issues of jurisdiction\nand due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).  \nDuring the hearing held on January 23, 2019, the Judge indicated that he would leave the\nrecord open until February 1, 2019, to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional\nmatters.  Tr. at 134-135.  On January 24, 2019, Applicant\u2019s Counsel sent an email with an\nattachment to Department Counsel for submission to the Judge.  On that same day, the Judge\nresponded to both parties by saying, \u201cI have received the e-mail and attached document.  I will treat\nthe record as closed unless there is a specific request otherwise.\u201d  Reply Brief at Attachment 1.  No\nresponses or further emails from the parties about leaving the record open are in the record.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant notes the Judge closed the record on January 25, 2019, i.e., six\ndays prior to the \u201cagreed upon date.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also states his lawyer sent one\ndocument to DOHA without waiting for additional evidence he was seeking to send.  His appeal\nbrief contains two documents.  For purposes of resolving the appeal, we construe his brief as\nasserting that he intended to send the two documents to the Judge within the original time frame.  \nOne of the documents attached to Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is a copy of the Amendment to\nthe SOR with his circled and initialed \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d responses to each of the five allegations\nlisted in that document.  Interestingly, this copy of his response to the SOR Amendment does not\nmatch the one in the record.  In the record copy of his SOR Amendment response, Applicant circled\nand  initialed \u201cadmit\u201d for each of the five listed allegations.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel also provided two\nletters containing explanations for each of those five admissions.  In the copy of the SOR\nAmendment response attached to his appeal brief, he circled and initialed \u201cadmit\u201d for three of the\nallegations and \u201cdeny\u201d for the other two.  In the submitting that document, he stated, \u201cI also included\nthe 4 page amendment to the SOR which shows I Deny 2a. and 1g. which refers [cross-alleges] 2a.-\n2d. and explained why I feel Guideline G does not apply.\u201d  Appeal Brief Cover Letter.  However,\nhe does not explain why the copy he submitted with his appeal brief does not match the one in the\nrecord.  The copy of the SOR Amendment response attached to his appeal brief does not establish\nany due process violation.  Moreover, because it contradicts record evidence without any\nexplanation for that incongruity, it is considered new evidence and will not be considered in\nanalyzing the merits of his appeal.  \nThe other document attached to Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is a copy of a state court record. \nIt is apparently being offered regarding the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a.4  The court record reflects that\nhe was charged with operation while under the influence or while having an elevated blood alcohol\n4 In his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that he had \u201cone suspected DUI\u201d in 1980 instead of two as alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 2.a.  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse findings that Applicant was charged with public\nswearing/intoxication in 2007, but this was also an allegation that he admitted in responding to the SOR Amendment. \n4\n\ncontent and improper turn/stop.5   While the date of arrest is unreadable, it reflects that he pled guilty\nto reckless driving and was fined in May 1980.  In his brief, Applicant does not state that this\ndocument was forwarded either to his Counsel, Department Counsel, or the Judge before the original\ndeadline for closing the record (February 1, 2019).  Consequently, he has failed to establish a prima\nfacie case of a due process violation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02933 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 23,\n2016).  Moreover, in the unlikely event the state court record was forwarded to DOHA before the\noriginal deadline and did not make it into the record, such an error was harmless because it likely\ndid not affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15188 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25,\n2013).  Given that Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, the state court record is not\nsufficient to show that the Judge erred in his findings and conclusions regarding that allegation. \nFurthermore, even if the Judge would have found for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a in light of that\ndocument, such a change in the findings would not likely have altered the ultimate adverse decision\nconsidering the other unfavorable SOR findings. \nOther Appeal Issues\nApplicant states that he has no violations or incidents over the past five years while working\nwith classified information and highlights his excellent job performance.  He also argues that he had\nthree reckless driving convictions over a period of 39 years with a 25-year span between the second\nand third offenses and such conduct does not show a pattern of excessive alcohol use.  His\narguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\nthe record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  Additionally, an\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Id. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor  of the national\nsecurity.\u201d\n5 The court document references a statute section for the original offense, which correlates to the charge noted\nabove. \n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned; Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested\na hearing.  On January 4, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He retired from the military\nin the early 2000s.   He admitted the SOR allegations with explanations.  In 2009, after attempting\nsuicide, he was committed to a hospital for observation and mental health treatment.  He was\ndischarged with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, with Psychotic\nFeatures.  \nIn 2017, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed psychologist/clinical \nneuropsychologist who diagnosed him with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe, with\nPsychotic Features; and Delusional Disorder, Prosecutory Type.  The psychologist concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental state and functioning impacts his ability, reliability, judgment, stability\nand trustworthiness in handling or safeguarding classified information.\u201d  Decision at 6, quoting from \nGovernment Exhibit 3.  The psychologist also noted that he agreed with Applicant\u2019s treating\npsychiatrist that Applicant \u201cis able to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or\nbeing fired from his place of employment.\u201d  Id.  Applicant\u2019s treating psychologist stated that\nApplicant \u201cis a very willing and cooperative client who has an excellent prognosis.\u201d  Decision at 7,\nquoting from Applicant Exhibit B.  \nThe Judge concluded that none of the mitigating conditions applied with enough force to\novercome the weight of the evidence.  Applicant is still subject to delusions.  The Judge noted that\nthe \u201cexcellent prognosis\u201d came from the psychologist who is treating Applicant for anxiety issues\nas opposed to depressive, psychotic, and delusional mental health concerns.  Decision at 11.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions.  He asserts\nhis anxiety issues are being treated, notes that his psychiatrist is working to resolve his\ndepression/delusion issues with new medication, and argues that his ability to function at work\nmitigates the security concerns.  Such arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\n2\n\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn September 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 30, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for her current employer, a Federal contractor, since November 2018. \nThis is her first application for access to protected information.  Applicant has worked for other\nFederal contractors since 2002.  However, she experienced unemployment from June to November\nof 2011.  Her previous jobs did not provide medical insurance, and she incurred some medical debts. \nIn 2007, Applicant and her ex-husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection because they could\nnot afford to pay their mortgage.  The bankruptcy action discharged about $270,000 worth of debt. \nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s husband left her, and the couple divorced.  Applicant sold the marital\nhome, purchased in 2010, in a short-sale.  Applicant\u2019s current husband is retired military and has\nadvised her on resolving her financial problems.  She testified that she prepared a spreadsheet to\ndemonstrate her efforts at debt resolution, but she did not submit it to the Judge as she had promised\nto do.\nThe Judge found that some of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts had been resolved.  However, he\nentered adverse findings in regard to four debts.  One was a delinquent automobile loan in the\namount of over $10,000, charged off in 2014.  This was a debt jointly incurred between Applicant\nand her ex-husband.  In her interview, Applicant stated that she would resolve this debt after she had\ntaken care of smaller ones.  She testified at the hearing that the creditor offered to settle the debt for\n$8,000, but she could not afford to pay that amount.  Applicant did not provide documentary\nevidence of this settlement offer.  In her post-hearing submission, she asserted that the creditor told\nher that it would not seek to enforce this debt, as it was beyond the statute of limitations.  She did\nnot corroborate this matter.  \nThe other debts that the Judge resolved adversely to Applicant were for medical expenses. \nOne of these was for eye surgery in late 2014, the total amount of which was almost $3,000. \nAlthough Applicant promised to make regular payments, she had made none as of the close of the\nrecord.  Applicant settled and/or paid the remaining two medical debts after she received the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $96,000, and her husband\u2019s is about $104,000 plus an\nunspecified amount in military retirement pay.  Her husband makes child support payments from\n2\n\nan earlier marriage and is jointly liable for payments on a previous residence.  Applicant stated that\nshe did not contact her creditors until recently because she did not have enough income to make\npayments on her debts.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAs noted, the Judge resolved some debts in Applicant\u2019s favor.  As regards those underlying\nhis adverse decision, he acknowledged circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected her\nfinancial problems.  However, he concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action\nin regard to her debts.  The Judge noted, for example, that Applicant had made payments for a while\non the delinquent automobile loan but stopped doing so well before her period of unemployment. \nShe did not corroborate her testimony about negotiations with the creditor, nor did she demonstrate\nexpeditious resolution of her medical debts.  The Judge stated that Applicant demonstrated no\nfinancial counseling other than that required for bankruptcy filing and concluded that her debts are\nnot under control.  The Judge found that Applicant submitted a plan for resolving the laser surgery\ndebt but that she had made no payments by the close of the record.  Overall, he concluded that\nApplicant had not demonstrated a track record of debt payment sufficient to mitigate all of the\nconcerns alleged against her.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters outside the record.  These include documents that post-\ndate the Judge\u2019s decision.  We are not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.1  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contained errors, for example his\nfindings about her purported reliance on the statute of limitations for resolution of the automobile\nloan, the extent to which her financial problems originated with her ex-husband, etc.  We have\nexamined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s material findings are\nsupported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  Applicant\u2019s brief cites to no error in the Judge\u2019s findings that would likely have affected\nthe outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00260 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2018). \nFurthermore, the non-collectability of a debt does not inhibit a Judge from considering the\ncircumstances of an applicant\u2019s delinquencies.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSep. 19, 2008). \nMany of Applicant\u2019s arguments constitute a challenge to the manner in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the record\nis not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\n1The new evidence pertains to the resolution of debts after the Judge issued his decision.  Even if this were\nevidence that we could consider, it would not refute a principal feature of the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding the timing of\nApplicant\u2019s efforts at debt payment.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 16-03595 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2018).  Access to\nprotected information requires faithful adherence to the rules and regulations governing such activity.  A person who\nbegins to address concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the\nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).   \n3\n\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

The standard applicable to trustworthiness\ncases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v.

The Judge found against Applicant on the two\nSOR allegations.

Tr. 12-17, 21, 68-69, and 78-79.  \nThe main thrust of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is that he provides a valuable contribution to\nnational security.  In the past, the Appeal Board has noted an applicant\u2019s contributions to national\nsecurity are not relevant or material in assessing his or her security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-11570 at 8 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  To the extent that Applicant is requesting a waiver of\nthe security concerns under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C, he has not shown that such an exception is\nmerited.

On June\n20, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 20, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has been employed by a Defense contractor since October 2013.  He experienced\nunemployment from September 2012 until he assumed his current duties.  He held a clearance from\n2002 until 2007.  Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges numerous delinquent debts.  The ones at issue in this\nappeal are student loans.  Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September 2016,\nand his debts were discharged the following January.  All of his SOR debts were covered by the\nbankruptcy discharge, except for the student loans.  Applicant entered into a repayment plan for\nthem in October 2017.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his having lived beyond his means and to his\nunemployment.  His irresponsible spending led to judgments being levied against him.  The Judge\nconcluded that the receipt of the SOR precipitated Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing.  Applicant\nprovided no current budget.  He has no track record of payment on the student loans, nor did he\nsubmit character references, his work record, or evidence of community involvement.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing and did not result from\ncircumstances outside his control, given his admission of irresponsible spending.  However, he also\nstated that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are unlikely to recur.  The Judge noted that Applicant\nadmitted to his interviewer in 2015 that his student loans would not be discharged but did not\narrange a payment plan until after the hearing.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes information not contained in the record.  We cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant notes the Judge\u2019s comment that he did not\nprovide character evidence.  He points out that his mother appeared at the hearing and testified that\nhe is trustworthy.  We conclude that this error is harmless, in that it did not likely affect the outcome\nof the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant cites to his prior belief that his student loans were covered by bankruptcy.  He\nstates that he set up a payment plan as soon as he discovered otherwise and that the timing of his\nbankruptcy filing after receipt of the SOR was merely coincidental.  He also cites to the Judge\u2019s\n2\n\nconclusion that his problems are unlikely to recur.  On this last point, the mitigating condition in\nquestion also requires that the financial circumstances do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(a).  The Judge did\nnot make a finding that this criterion had been satisfied.  All in all, Applicant has not shown that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  \nApplicant notes that the Judge\u2019s decision was issued long after the hearing.   Applicant has\nnot shown how this delay caused the Judge to commit a factual or legal error based on the record\nthat was before him.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2018); see also\nDISCR Case No. 92-0009 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 20, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On\nDecember 11, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant, who is 46 years old, has been working for a defense contractor since 2013.  While\nexperiencing some gaps in employment, she has been working for defense contractors since 1992. \nShe was granted a security clearance in 2007.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2005 and had\n12 delinquent debts totaling about $12,000.  On her 2014 security clearance application (SCA), she\nfailed to list her delinquent debts and disclose criminal arrests and citations.  She documented no\nefforts to address her debts.  She attributed her bankruptcy to her divorce in 1997, but this is\nattenuated.  She provided no character references or documentation of financial counseling. \nIn a footnote, the Judge noted that Applicant thought the SCA question pertaining to felony\ncharges applied only to those occurring within the last seven years.  While she provided no\ncorroboration for her claim to have disclosed the felony charge to an investigator in 2007, the age\nof the criminal charge in question (occurring nearly 25 years before her SCA submission) renders\nthe allegation of little security significance.  Her explanations for omissions of her financial\nproblems and other criminal charges are less credible. \nApplicant has an extensive history of financial problems and did not provide documentation\nof efforts to resolve those problems.  Similarly, the Government established cases for\ndisqualification under Guidelines J and E.  Her SOR response does not contain a thorough\nexplanation for her criminal conduct or SCA omissions.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the falsification allegations, Applicant contends that her SCA omissions were not\ndeliberate.  For example, she claims she had no clue what was on her credit report until she was\ninterviewed by an investigator.  We note that Applicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s\nspecific findings of fact pertaining to the falsification allegations.  It also merits noting that \ncircumstantial evidence may establish an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the alleged\nfalsification occurred.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05850 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2013). \n2\n\nAdditionally, we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01077 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2018).  From our review\nof the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings about the falsification allegations are based on\nsubstantial record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  Applicant\nfailed to establish that the Judge erred in concluding that she falsified her SCA. \nApplicant has provided detailed explanations pertaining to her financial problems and\ncriminal charges.  These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judges weighing of the\nevidence and are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30,\n2018).  \nApplicant has also provided us with contact information for her doctor, supervisors, and\nother character references.  However, the Appeal Board cannot consider new evidence (Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29) and has no authority to interview witnesses, conduct investigations, or make findings of\nfact.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03072 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018).  \n \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 27, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On April 11, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Francisco Mendez granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn August 23, 2018, we remanded the case to correct an identified error.  On November 28,\n2018, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive.\nApplicant has raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nNote:  The basis for the remand was to clarify the status of Government Exhibit (GE) 2,\nAnswers to Interrogatories, that included a summary of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview.  The prior\nJudge had admitted this document into evidence, though he noted Applicant\u2019s claim that parts of it\nwere not accurate.  The Judge gave the parties an opportunity after the hearing to submit additional\nevidence or argument concerning this exhibit, though neither did.  The Judge made no additional\nfindings or rulings regarding it.\nIn considering Department Counsel\u2019s appeal of the prior Judge\u2019s favorable holding, we were\nnot able to conclude from the record that was before us what parts of the interview description\nApplicant had adopted or had not adopted.  That is, we were \u201cunable to discern whether key\nstatements were admitted into, or excluded from, evidence.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Accordingly, we\nremanded the case for further processing.  During the hearing on remand, the Judge stated that he\nwould consider the evidence admitted at the prior hearing, including the transcript.  He stated that\nthe remand hearing would focus upon the admissibility of GE 2.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for Federal contractors for more than thirty years and has held a\nclearance since 1970.  He served on active duty with the U.S. military from 1970 to 1975.  He holds\na doctoral degree.  Married and divorced twice, he has five children.  \nAt the remand hearing, Department Counsel called the investigator who had prepared the\ninterview description contained in GE 2.  This person testified about her training and experience and\nthe methods that she employs when questioning applicants and memorializing their answers. \nSpecifically, she testified that she wrote down an applicant\u2019s answers using whatever words the\napplicant had used and did not paraphrase them.  Although she admitted that she did not remember\nthe details of Applicant\u2019s interview, she testified as to her confidence that the interview description\nwas a 100% accurate presentation of Applicant\u2019s answers.  The Judge concluded that this witness\nhad authenticated the GE 2, and he admitted it into evidence. \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s findings of security concern were drawn substantially from GE 2.  In essence,\nApplicant had a relationship with a foreign woman who appeared in pornographic videos.  \nApplicant had joined a fan club through which he could watch these pornographic videos.  The\nwoman led Applicant to understand that she would have sex with him, and on about five occasions\nhe paid her $1,200 for sex.  He traveled to different cities for that purpose and would usually meet\nher for dinner, followed by engaging in sexual activity in a hotel room.  He also invited her to a\nvacation home that he owned, asking his daughter, who was staying at the home, to leave for a few\nhours so that he could be alone with the woman.  He characterized himself as her customer and\nfriend.  Applicant admitted that he knew that prostitution was illegal.\n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge found that the interviewer\u2019s testimony authenticating GE 2 resolved the issue that\nwas the reason for the remand.  He also stated that, although he was not convinced that GE 2 was\n100% accurate, neither was he convinced that the contents of the description regarding the woman\nwere a fabrication, as Applicant claimed.  The Judge noted the presumption that Government\nofficials discharge their duties in good faith and found no reason to deny the good faith of the\nauthenticating witness.  In examining Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, the Judge concluded that the\nconduct in question was recent, frequent, and not unlikely to recur.  He did note that the conduct\ntook place in private and that it was consensual.  However, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nconduct impugned his judgment, and he entered adverse formal findings under both Guidelines.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in holding against him.  He contends that GE 2 was\nneither substantiated nor corroborated, as required by case law.  He argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse\nfindings and conclusions constituted an improper substitution of a credibility determination for\nactual evidence.\nWe examine a Judge\u2019s decision to admit evidence to see if it is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g,. ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  Because GE 2\nwas drawn from a DoD background report of investigation (ROI), the Judge properly evaluated its\nadmissibility under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.  This paragraph states, in pertinent part, as follows:\nOfficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business,\nother than [a] DoD [ROI], may be received and considered by the Administrative\nJudge without authenticating witnesses . . . An ROI may be received with an\nauthenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules\nof Evidence[.] \nIn this case, as the Judge noted, the official who conducted Applicant\u2019s interview and prepared the\ninterview summary contained in GE 2 satisfied the authentication requirement of \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n3\n\nMoreover, GE 2 meets the second prong of \u00b6 E3.1.20 because it is admissible as evidence of\nstatements by a party opponent in accordance with FRE 801(d) or, in the alternative, is admissible\nas a record of a regularly recurring activity\u2013in this case a security clearance investigation\u2013under\nFRE 803(6).  The Judge\u2019s decision to admit GE 2 was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant appears to argue that, insofar as he denied the truthfulness of GE 2, the\nGovernment was required to provide independent corroborating evidence of the facts stated therein\nas a condition of admissibility.  He cites to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and its requirement of an\nauthenticating witness, and we construe the argument to mean that the Government was required to\npresent a witness who could not merely authenticate, or identify, GE 2 but independently\ncorroborate the matters asserted therein before the Judge could consider the exhibit.  However, as\nour discussion above attests, authentication is simply a means whereby the proponent of evidence\nestablishes that the evidence is what it purports to be, in this case a record of Applicant\u2019s clearance\ninterview.  See FRE 901for a discussion of authentication as a condition precedent to admissibility.1 \nThe Directive does not require independent substantive corroboration of the facts asserted within\nan interview description or similar document.  Once a DoD ROI is authenticated and found\nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a Judge may consider it for the truth of the matter\nasserted, even if there is no other evidence of those matters.  Applicant cites to numerous Appeal\nBoard cases in his brief.  However, these cases address the admissibility of interview descriptions\nwhen there has been no authenticating witness, for example when the applicant waives an objection\nto the evidence (ISCR Case No. 15-01807 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2017)) or when the applicant admits\nthat the report accurately depicts his answers (ISCR Case No. 09-06218 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2011)). \nNone of these cases establish a requirement that even when a witness has authenticated an interview\ndescription within the meaning of the Directive, the Government must still present independent\nevidence of its assertions before it can be admitted and considered over an applicant\u2019s objection.2 \n To the extent Applicant is disagreeing with the weight the Judge gave to the evidence or is\ndisagreeing with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, such disagreements are not sufficient to demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00310 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018).\n1FRE 901(a) provides that the \u201crequirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to\nadmissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent\nclaims.\u201d  Authentication simply means that it is authored by, or issued by, or has its source in, what or who is claimed. \nIt does not, in and of itself, mean that factual statements in the document must be accepted as true.  For this the document\nmust be evaluated for admissibility as a hearsay exception, etc.  See Rothstein, Practice Comment to 901(a), Federal\nRules of Evidence, Third Edition (2008).\n2 We also note Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s decision was based upon non-alleged conduct.  However,\nnon-alleged conduct means conduct that is not alleged in the SOR, which denies the applicant fair notice of the concerns\nto be addressed in the DOHA proceeding.  Applicant\u2019s conduct was indeed alleged in the SOR, and the Government\u2019s\nevidence, including the properly admitted GE 2, constitutes substantial evidence of the allegations.  The Judge\u2019s material\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).\n4\n\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He produced little to show his efforts to resolve the\nstudent loans before the SOR was issued.  He provided character reference letters that describe him\nas honest and trustworthy.  \nThe Judge=s Pertinent Analysis\nApplicant accumulated delinquent student loans and largely ignored them before the SOR\n1 In the formal findings, the Judge found for Applicant on Guideline D and against him on its subparagraphs, i.e., SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  Applicant\u2019s counsel contends that, based on a reading of the decision, the Judge\u2019s formal findings\nconcerning those subparagraphs were a typographical error.  We agree.  See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 91-1449 at 3,\nn.2 (App. Bd. Apr. 26 1993) (In addressing an inconsistency in the formal findings, we read a Judge\u2019s decision in its\nentirety to discern his or her meaning.).\n2\n\nwas issued. These delinquencies are recent, frequent, and were not incurred under unusual\ncircumstances.  By 2011, he was aware that his military tuition assistance did not cover the loans. \nThereafter, he did not act responsibly in addressing these debts until he received the SOR.  He failed\nto document his efforts to deal with the creditors after becoming aware of the defaulted loans.  \nApplicant has made a number of payments to resolve student loans that may or may not\ncorrelate to those alleged in the SOR.  Even if he made those payments on the alleged student loans,\nhe did not undertake such efforts until after he received the SOR.  Such belated efforts do not\nmitigate the security concerns arising from the alleged student loans. \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that he resolved each of the student loans that the Judge found against\nhim.  In doing so, he cites to his exhibits that the Judge indicated were difficult to decipher.  Based\non our review of the record, the Board concludes that the Judge=s material findings regarding the\nstudent loan debts are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or\ninferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 25, 2014). In this regard, we note the principle feature of the Judge=s analysis is not that\nApplicant failed to take action to resolve the student loans, but rather that he failed to take action\nto resolve them in a timely manner.  Access to protected information requires faithful adherence to\nthe rules and regulations governing such activity.  A person who begins to address concerns only\nafter having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to\nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence,  mis-weighed\nthe evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For\nexample, he argues that he resolved the alleged student loans, that he was the victim of predatory\nlending practices, and that the delinquencies were the result of his confusion regarding their status. \nHowever, Applicant=s arguments are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).2  We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case\nthat Applicant has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to\nundermine the Judge=s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  Additionally, the Judge complied with the requirements\nof the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching\nhis decision. \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\n2 Applicant cites to an assertion he made in his response to the SOR which could lead to the conclusion that he was a\nvictim of predatory lending practices.  There is no corroboration for the assertion.  Also, there is no detailed explanation\nas to how much of his delinquent debt can reasonably be attributed to the alleged predatory lending practices. \n3\n\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMark A. Myers, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n8, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2,\n1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 12, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant is 40 years old.  He has been working for his current employer since 2004 and was\ngranted a security clearance in 2005.  His security clearance was suspended in 2013 following his\narrest on sexual assault charges involving his stepdaughter.  He married in 2006, separated from his\nwife following the arrest, and divorced in 2017.\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in early 2013 on three counts\nof rape of a child and one count of witness intimidation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he was indicted later\nin 2013 on four counts of aggravated rape of a child, six counts of indecent assault and battery on\na child under age 14, one count of assault and battery with intent to rape, and one count of assault\nand battery by means of a dangerous weapon (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b\nare duplicative.  Both of those allegations were cross-alleged under Guidelines D and E.  Under\nGuideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to report his arrest to his facility security\nofficer (FSO) in a timely manner and that he lied on his security clearance application (SCA) and\nduring his background interview in 2015 by stating he was falsely accused of the criminal\nallegations.1  \nIn 2013, Applicant\u2019s then 12-year-old stepdaughter told her mother that Applicant had\nsexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.  She described the incidents and indicated that\nApplicant threatened to beat her with a belt if she told anyone of the assaults.  The police were\nnotified and arrested Applicant, who remained in custody for a week.  The police record reveals that\nthe stepdaughter had also told a 13-year-old friend of the assaults.  \nApplicant notified his security office of the arrest and charges about four months following\nthe arrest and about three weeks after the indictment.  The security office submitted an adverse\n1 In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was arrested and indicted on the alleged charges but\nclaimed those charges were based on false accusations.  He admitted that he did not report his arrest to his FSO in a\ntimely manner and denied the two falsification allegations. \n2\n\ninformation report that indicated Applicant did not report the exact charges and also stated that he\ndid not report the matter sooner because he was scared. At the security clearance hearing, he\nindicated that he understood he was required to report the arrest when it happened but attributed the\ndelay to being stressed and being focused on taking care of his family. \nApplicant pled not guilty to the charges.  The State filed with the court a Statement of the\nCase that summarized the facts, which indicated the alleged conduct progressed from initially\nfondling the stepdaughter when she was nine years old to eventually rape.  The attorney who\nrepresented Applicant in the criminal proceeding indicated that Applicant rejected plea bargain\noffers, and there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crimes.  In early 2015, the State\nmoved to nolle prosequi the charges because it did not believe that it could meet its burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at trial.  \u201cIn addition, the state did not believe it was in the victim\u2019s best\ninterest to proceed at that time.\u201d  Decision at 4, citing Government Exhibit (GE) 5.  \nIn his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he was falsely\naccused of the sexual assault charges.  In a 2016 background interview, he denied ever touching\nchildren inappropriately and indicated that the charges against him were false.  When asked about\nthe delay in reporting his arrest during the interview, he indicated he was trying to get his personal\nlife in order.  \nIn responding to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he has a healthy co-parenting plan\nwith his ex-wife.  At the hearing, he stated that he has unsupervised weekly contact with his two\nchildren.  He has no visitation rights with the stepdaughter.  He provided no reason for why his\nstepdaughter would falsely accuse him.  He provided annual performance evaluations that praise his\nwork performance.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cThe indictment indicates the grand jury believed Applicant committed felonious sexual\nassaults on his stepdaughter between 2009 and . . . [2013] and that he threatened to assault her if she\ntold anyone about the assaults. . . .  The evidentiary standard for a grand jury indictment is probable\ncause to believe the defendant committed the offense. . . .  In the state at issue, probable cause\nrequires more than mere suspicion but something less than evidence sufficient to warrant a\nconviction.\u201d  Decision at 8.  \u201cThe Government\u2019s evidence includes police reports containing\ncontemporaneous summaries of interviews of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and close friend of Applicant\u2019s\nstepdaughter about the sexual assaults as detailed to them by Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter. . . .  There\nis no apparent motive for either of them to have made false statements to the police about what they\nwere told.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThere is no statement in evidence from Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, but the grand jury\nindictment and the statements to the police from her mother and friend constitute probative, reliable\n3\n\nevidence that may be considered in these proceedings, and together raise security concerns under\n[Adjudicative Guideline] \u00b6 31(b).\u201d2  Id. at 9. \nThe decision of the prosecutor to dismiss the charges was based on the best interests of the\nstepdaughter and because the State did not think it could prove the charges beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.  That decision is not a finding of no culpability.  \nApplicant demonstrated a lack of candor about the criminal charges during his security\nclearance adjudication, which diminishes the credibility of his denials of committing the alleged sex\ncrimes.   He under-reported the extent of the criminal charges against him to his security office, on\nhis 2015 SCA, and during his background interview.  \u201cHis denials of any inappropriate behavior\nwith his stepdaughter lack credibility.\u201d  Decision at 10.   \nApplicant did not comply with his obligation to report his arrest to security officials in a\ntimely manner.  Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that Applicant lied when he claimed he was\nfalsely accused of the criminal sex offenses in his SCA and background interview.  His minimization\nof his charges on those occasions, which was not specifically alleged and cannot be considered as\na disqualifying factor, shows a lack of reform and reliability.  Although more than five years have\npassed since the sex crimes, he has not yet shown he can be counted on to comply with reporting\nrequirements.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on one Guideline J allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and\nagainst him on the remaining allegations.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the criminal conduct allegations, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the entire case\nagainst his client is based on hearsay.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel notes the record neither contains a\nstatement from the stepdaughter about the alleged sexual assaults nor a report of a physical\nexamination performed on her.  He argues that the record lacks credible and substantive evidence\nand the burden of production was improperly shifted to him during the proceeding.  He further\nasserts that the Judge\u2019s findings based solely on hearsay do not comport with the Directive.  These \narguments are not persuasive.  In administrative proceedings, hearsay is admissible and can\nconstitute substantial evidence.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Dept. of Agriculture, 50 F. 3d 46, 49 (D.C.\nCir. 1995); Bustos-Torres v. INS, 898 F.2d 1053, 1056 (5th Cir. 1990); Willingham v. Gonzales, 391\nF. Supp. 2d 52, 64 (Dist. Ct. D.C., 2005), quoting Hoska v. Army, 677 F.2d 131, 138 (D.C. Cir.\n1982).  DOHA proceedings are administrative in nature, and they are not conducted with a strict\napplication of evidentiary rules required in criminal cases, although DOHA relies upon the Federal\nRules of Evidence (FRE) as a guide in its hearings.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n11-12461 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013).  Public records admissible under FRE 803(8), such as court\nrecords and police reports, are presumed to be reliable by virtue of the government agency\u2019s duty for\n2 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 31(b) states, \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged,\nprosecuted, or convicted[.]\u201d\n4\n\naccuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that duty.3  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-07509\n5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2013), citing United States v. Carter, 591 F.3d 656, 659 (D.C. Cir. 2010). \nIn this case, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s reliance on hearsay documents in making her findings\nof fact or in reaching her conclusions.   \nApplicant Counsel also contends that Judge erred in her consideration of the State\u2019s decision\nto nolle prosequi the charges.  In this regard, we note that the dropping or dismissal of criminal\ncharges does not preclude the Judge from finding an applicant engaged in the conduct underlying\nthose charges or from evaluating the applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 14-01763 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015). \nIn his argument, Applicant Counsel states, \u201cThere is simply no evidence in this record to support the\ndetermination that the State\u2019s decision not to prosecute was due to considerations of \u2018best interests\u2019\nof the alleged victim.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 10.  On the other hand, he also notes that the State\u2019s nolle\nprosequi court filing, which was signed by the Assistant District Attorney, states, \u201cwe do not believe\nit is in the victim\u2019s best interest to proceed at this time.\u201d  GE 5 at 3.  He argues, \u201cWhile seemingly\nsplitting hairs, it is submitted that the wording is critical in that the inference is that the testimony\nof the alleged victim would not hold up against zealous cross examination; [p]erhaps due to multiple\nversion[s] of events.\u201d  In support of his claimed reasons for the dismissal of the charges, Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel cites to GE 2 and 5.  However, neither of those documents nor any other record evidence\nsupports the contention of Applicant\u2019s Counsel that the charges were dropped \u201cdue to  [the victim\u2019s]\nmultiple versions of events\u201d or because the \u201cvictim would not hold up against zealous cross-\nexamination.\u201d4  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the State\u2019s decision\nto dismiss the charges are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that\ncould be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nApplicant Counsel further challenges the Judge\u2019s reliance on the indictments as proof that\nhe engaged in criminal conduct and argues that \u201cPattern Jury Instructions warn jurors that an \n\u2018indictment is proof of nothing\u2019 and \u2018it does not even raise suspicion of guilt.\u2019\u201d5  Appeal Brief at 9. \nIn making his arguments, he also highlights a number of the unique aspects of grand jury\nproceedings.6  However, as noted above, DOHA proceedings are not required to comply with rules\n3 In DOHA proceedings, police reports are admissible both as official records under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and\nas public records under FRE 803(8).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017).\n4 In referring to the nolle prosequi decision during his closing argument, Applicant\u2019s Counsel at the hearing\nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the prosecutor used to reach that decision.\u201d  Tr. at 64.  The record of the proceeding was left\nopen for Applicant\u2019s Counsel to present an affidavit from the attorney who represented Applicant in the criminal\nproceeding.  That affidavit does not state a reason for the prosecutor\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges.  Applicant\u2018s\nExhibit F.\n5 The sample jury instructions are not contained in the record.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel neither requested that we\ntake administrative notice of the jury instructions nor provided a citation to those instructions.  \n6 The thrust of Applicant\u2019s Counsel arguments is that a prosecutor controls grand jury proceedings and little\nweight should be given to an indictment.   \n5\n\nor procedures that pertain to criminal prosecutions.  Jury instructions have no application in DOHA\nproceedings.  In this regard, we also note that Applicant has not specifically challenged the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that, in the state at issue, an indictment is a grand jury determination that probable cause\nexists to believe the defendant committed the offense.  Based on our review of the record,\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to show that the Judge erred in her consideration of the indictments. \nThe balance of the arguments of Applicant\u2019s Counsel amount to a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of the evidence.  He argues that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence and \nmis-weighed the evidence.  His arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 4, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nAt the hearing, the Judge amended the SOR by adding another Guideline F allegation.  Tr. at 90-91.\nOn February 26, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling over\n$99,000.  It also alleged that he had three Chapter 13 bankruptcies dismissed between 1999 and\n2013, that he was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2014, and that he filed Chapter 13\nbankruptcy in March 2018, which was pending approval of a plan.  The pending bankruptcy lists\ndebts \u2013 over $93,000 in an educational loan and nearly $9,000 in Federal and state taxes \u2013 that are\nlikely not dischargeable.  He paid three of the alleged debts after the SOR was issued.  He and his\nwife have been plagued with a series of automobile accidents, injuries, and illnesses.  They have\nincurred significant out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatments.  Applicant documented that he\nreceived financial counseling and provided character references attesting to his honesty and\ntrustworthiness.\n  \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on four bankruptcy allegations in the SOR and against\nhim on the remaining allegations, including the one involving the 2018 bankruptcy proceeding. \nApplicant did not address $4,000 in delinquent debts until after he received the SOR.  He began a\nrehabilitation plan for his $95,000 educational loan before issuance of the SOR but failed to submit\ninformation about the status of the loan after March 2017.  He encountered circumstances beyond\nhis control, and his filing of the latest bankruptcy petition can be considered reasonable under the\ncircumstances.  However, he falls short of showing progress on the pending bankruptcy.  His one\npayment on the still unapproved plan is insufficient to establish a favorable track record of payments. \nIt is too soon to conclude that his financial problems have been resolved or are under control. He has\nnot shown a good-faith effort to address his debts.      \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence.  For example, he argues that his\nfinancial problems were due to conditions beyond his control and that he has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances in his attempts to resolve those problems.  His arguments, however, are neither\nenough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient\nto show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant contends that the Judge applied guidelines to him that pertain to military personnel. \nIt appears that Applicant is making this contention based on the Judge\u2019s citation to Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) in the decision.1  This contention does not raise any error. \n1 Egan is a U.S. Supreme Court decision that does not specifically address the granting or denial of security\nclearances to military personnel; however, it does generally address the Executive Branch\u2019s authority to grant or deny\nsecurity clearances.  \n2\n\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines used in this case apply to practically all individuals who require access\nto classified information, including DoD contractors.  See Directive, Encl. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 B, C, D.4, D.5, and\nD.8 that address the applicability of the Adjudicative Guidelines. \nApplicant argues that the Judge asked him more questions than Department Counsel.  To the\nextent that Applicant is claiming the Judge was not impartial, we did not find that argument\npersuasive.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-03108 at 3 (App. Bd. May 20, 2015).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge\nwas unbiased.2 \nApplicant asserts that he received a security clearance in 2002 that was renewed in 2013 and\nthat he should not have to renew it again until 2023.  He also notes that the Judge indicated the\nreason for the current background investigation is unclear.   To the extent that Applicant is arguing\nthat the Government was precluded from reevaluating his security clearance eligibility, we do not\nfind that argument persuasive.  A favorable security decision does not give an applicant the right to\nretain a security clearance regardless of subsequent events or changed circumstances.  The\nGovernment is not barred from issuing an adverse security clearance decision once it becomes aware\nof information that calls into question an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007). \nApplicant further argues that he should have a right to know any and all accusations against\nhim and the decision should be based on what actually happened as opposed to what could happen. \nIn making these arguments, he highlights that there is no proof that he engaged in any wrongdoing.\nThe SOR provided Applicant adequate notice of the Government\u2019s security concerns.3  Applicant\nhas not shown that he was denied any procedural due process rights afforded him under the\nDirective.  As the Appeal Board has previously stated, security clearance decisions are not an exact\nscience, but rather involve predictive judgments about an applicant\u2019s security eligibility in light of\nthe applicant\u2019s past conduct and present circumstances.  The Federal Government need not wait until\nan applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke\n2 We note the things that our colleague has addressed in his separate opinion and agree that the Judge could have\nspoken more temperately at times.  We do not believe that the matters raised in the separate opinion are sufficient to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge was impartial.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). \nMoreover, the Judge provided Applicant with an opportunity to present additional evidence, including an affidavit from\nhis wife, which significantly diminishes any harm that might otherwise have come about due to the ruling addressed in\nthe separate opinion. \n3 After the Judge indicated on the record the SOR amendment, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated, \u201cI have no heartburn\nwith that amendment, but I do think that I should have the -- if Your Honor is going to give weight to various debts listed\nin that bankruptcy, that we were not put on notice of, then I should have an opportunity to address those specific\nallegations in a proper response to the SOR.\u201d   Tr. at 91.  In this regard, we note that it was Applicant who introduced\ninto evidence that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2018.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) I and Tr. at 54-56. We also\nnote that, as mentioned in the previous footnote, Applicant was also provided an opportunity to submit post-hearing\nmatters, including matters about the debts in the bankruptcy and an affidavit from his wife.  AE M (1-15).    \n3\n\naccess to classified information based on an applicant\u2019s conduct or circumstances that raise security\nconcerns even in the absence of security violations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-09966 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jun. 25, 2008).  A history of financial difficulties raises security concerns.  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6\u00b6 18 and 19.  Guideline F security concerns are broader than the possibility that an applicant\nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money to satisfy his or her\ndebts.  Those concerns also encompass the risk that applicants who are financially irresponsible\nmight also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  In this case,\nApplicant has failed to show that the Judge erred in his analysis of the record evidence under\nGuideline F.  \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.  See also\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSee Dissenting Opinion              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

RA\u2019ANAN\nApplicant\u2019s brief raises the issue of bias: \u201c...it also seems that the decision had already been\nmade.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s brief at page 3.  In reviewing the transcript of the hearing for evidence of bias\n(or absence thereof), I noted several instances of seemingly hostile demeanor or  arbitrary rulings by\nthe Judge against either Applicant, Applicant\u2019s wife, or Applicant\u2019s attorney, a former DOHA\nofficial.  The attorney is not representing Applicant on appeal.  Cumulatively, these episodes support\na concern as to whether the Judge was biased or could reasonably be perceived as such.\nApplicant\u2019s wife has been in multiple accidents and had multiple surgeries and\nhospitalizations over several decades.  Furthermore, she is a cancer survivor.  She attended the\nHearing in a wheelchair.  Her testimony regarding her medical history and the attendant billing was\nintegral to Applicant\u2019s case.  On pages 9-10 of the transcript, Applicant\u2019s attorney moved to have\nthe wife testify first and not sequester her. The Judge responded to the motion as follows \u201cWell,\nbecause, [Applicant\u2019s attorney] we get to go through whether or not there are any procedural issues\nin the case in which case there will be issues discussed on the record that the witness doesn\u2019t need\nto hear, so it is appropriate.  So we\u2019re off the record.  Please make whatever arrangements you need\nto do to have [Applicant\u2019s wife] rest comfortably while we finish the rest of the preliminary stuff and\nwe begin the hearing, at which point you may then call her first, at which point after she has testified,\nbecause this hearing is open, she may remain in the hearing room.  We\u2019re off the record.  Thank\nyou.\u201d  At that point they went off the record for one hour and one minute.  When the proceedings\nresumed neither party had any procedural issues to address.\nAfter Applicant wife testified, the Judge said to her \u201cThank you for giving us your time here\nthis morning.  You are free to wheel yourself to the back of the hearing room and remain, as long\nas it takes.\u201d  Transcript pp. 47-48.  Note that the attorney had made no motion to have her stay in the\nroom, indeed, he never spoke at all, at that juncture.  On page 82, while Applicant is testifying, the\nJudge says \u201cYes $683 to [a bank] $312 to [another bank] $1,489 to [a third bank].  So with the\nalleged [cable tv company]\u2013I\u2019m sorry [Applicant\u2019s wife], you\u2019ve testified, and you\u2019re done.  I\u2019m\nsorry.  That\u2019s how it works.\u201d. . . .  On page 86, Applicant\u2019s attorney asked \u201cYour Honor, may I\nconsult for a moment in the hall with [Applicant\u2019s wife] to find out what\u2019s on her mind, and\ndetermine whether to ask you to allow--\u201d The Judge said \u201cNo, you may not.  It\u2019s the risk you run. \nShe stayed in the room.  She\u2019s heard the testimony now.  She had her chance to testify, and that was\npart of the reason for putting her on.  You will have an opportunity here to augment the record before\nI get done with this.  But you may not put [Applicant\u2019s wife] back on the stand.  Any more evidence\nfrom you?\u201d \nOn page 89, the Judge was discussing items that might be submitted after the hearing, the\nattorney interjected a question and the Judge said \u201cAnything else, I\u2019m just listing the things that\ncause me heartburn.  If there are things that you think will be helpful to your client, by all means,\nsubmit them, as long as its done by the close of business on the 27th.  I do note in making the offer\nthat the Applicant has had the SOR for more than a year.\u201d\n5\n\nOn page 90, the Judge (properly) decided to amend the SOR to include a bankruptcy that had\nnot been part of the SOR before.  At that point, Applicant\u2019s attorney asked for a written amendment\nto the SOR and an opportunity to respond to the amendment, at which point the Judge said, \u201cMotion\ndenied.  I\u2019m amending the SOR to allege that on or about March 9, 2018, the Applicant filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition as encapsulated in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I. . . .\u201d  After further\ndiscussion the Judge again denied the motion on page 92.  No written amendment was put in the\nrecord.\nThe Judge\u2019s  ruling against providing the SOR amendment in writing to Applicant\u2019s attorney\nand against providing time for a response run against the spirit if not the plain language of the second\nsentence of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17: When such amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may\ngrant either party\u2019s request for such additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem\nappropriate for further preparation or other good cause.\nThe Judge\u2019s approach to sequestering Applicant\u2019s wife, instructing her to \u201cwheel yourself\nback to the back of the hearing room and remain, as long as it takes[ ,]\u201d later prohibiting her from\noffering additional testimony, then prohibiting the attorney from finding out what she wanted to\naddress, and his implying, contrary to the record, that it was the attorney\u2019s decision to have her stay\nin the room are deeply troubling.  Proceedings at DOHA are subject to reasonable rules and\nprocedures.  However some flexibility is often accorded persons with disabilities or special needs. \nIn isolation none of the Judge\u2019s pertinent rulings or comments might have been worthy of note, in\ncombination they smack of either bias or the arbitrary wielding of authority.\nCumulatively, the issues I have noted justify remand to another Judge.  Especially since\nApplicant and his wife have had an usually rough medical history and concomitant financial\ndifficulties.  It is quite plausible that another Judge would analyze this record differently.\nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\n6\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJudd G. Millman, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 24, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She has held a security\nclearance for about 28 years.   The SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling about $24,900.  She\nprimarily attributed the delinquent debts to a geographic move associated with a military base\nclosure and to fluctuations in her earnings.  She also experienced medical problems that resulted in\nhospitalizations. \n \nApplicant negotiated a settlement of a delinquent car loan for a repossessed vehicle.  Under\nthat settlement, she made regular monthly payment of $175 from early 2016 to mid 2018.  However,\nshe failed to present sufficient documentation to establish that she has resolved or is resolving the\nother delinquent debts.  She acted responsibly towards the delinquent car loan, but not the other\ndebts.  \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  In fact, some of those documents post-date the Judge\u2019s decision.  We cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends  the Judge incorrectly stated that she has worked for different contractors. \nShe notes that she has worked for the same entity over the past 28 years, but it has changed names\nseveral times.  We conclude, however, this error was a harmless because it likely did not affect the\noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nApplicant also contends the Judge incorrectly analyzed the evidence.  She argues the Judge\nconcluded \u201cthe record fails to establish that her debts are being resolved or under control  . . . [and]\ndoes not show a good-faith effort by Applicant to repay overdue creditors\u201d despite evidence that she\nhas \u201cmore than a two-year track record of regular payments.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from\nDecision at 7 and 8.   The above quotes, however, are unrelated.  By contrasting them, Applicant\nhas taken them out of their context.  The Judge\u2019s quote pertaining to the \u201ctwo-year track record of\n2\n\nregular payments\u201d addressed Applicant\u2019s effort to resolve the car loan.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant on the car loan.  The other quote pertaining to Applicant\u2019s failure to establish that the\n\u201cdebts are being resolved or are under control\u201d addressed the other debts for which the Judge\nconcluded insufficient corroborating documentation was presented.  Applicant\u2019s contention does not\nestablish any error in the Judge\u2019s analysis.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that she took inconsistent positions regarding\nthe debts that undermined her credibility and judgment.  The Judge, for example, noted that\nApplicant testified that she entered into an agreement with the creditor to start making $100 monthly\npayments on a delinquent vehicle lease in August 2018.  Tr. at 35-38.  In her post-hearing\nsubmissions between June and September 2018, Applicant presented no proof of the agreement or\npayments under it, but indicated that her attorney was trying to settle that debt.  Decision at 8.  From\nour review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusion about Applicant taking inconsistent positions about\nthe debts is based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).   \nApplicant further argues \u201c[t]he debts were not incurred as a result of the concerns outlined\nin Guideline F, such as \u2018frivolous or irresponsible spending\u2019 and it certainly does not represent\n\u2018unexplained affluence.\u2019\u201d Appeal Brief at 5.  The Judge, however, did not conclude that the\ndisqualifying conditions pertaining to frivolous or irresponsible spending or unexplained affluence\napplied in this case.  Instead, the Judge concluded that Disqualifying Conditions 19(a), inability to\nsatisfy debts, and 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, applied.  His conclusions\nregarding the application of Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) and 19(c) were based on substantial\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3.   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  Those arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 29, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)  of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 17, 2018, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 37 year-old father of three children under the age of eleven.  \u201cFrom 2012 until\nMarch 2017, the mother had primary custody of Applicant\u2019s son and the mother\u2019s other two\nchildren, which were not Applicant\u2019s children.\u201d  Decision at 3- 4.  \u201cApplicant pays child support\nonly for his son, not the two other children the mother has from other fathers.\u201d  Decision at 4, fn.19. \nThe children\u2019s \u201cmother, pursuant to court order, has had primary custody since February, 22 2018.\u201d \nDecision at 4.  Applicant  was given physical custody of the three children at one point.  A college\ngraduate, he has been employed by defense contractors since 2014.  He has lived  with his girlfriend\nand her three children for almost five years.  His girlfriend does not receive child support for her\nthree children.  His girlfriend\u2019s oldest child has moved out of the home to attend college.  Applicant\nmakes about $130,000 per year and his girlfriend about makes $100,000 per year.  They divide the\nhousehold expenses equally.  His SOR lists twelve delinquent debts totaling just over $52,000. \nApplicant admitted to four debts and provided documentation showing he resolved three debts.  He\ndenied the remaining debt SOR allegations.  He denied the gambling SOR allegation and disputed\nhis delinquencies were due at least in part to his gambling.  Applicant attributed his financial\nproblems to his loss of employment and his child custody situation.\nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s unemployment and convoluted child custody situation led to\na substantial child support arrearage that was beyond his control.  He stated, that Applicant had\nfavorably addressed nine delinquent debts totaling just over $11,600, to include his child support\narrearage.  However, Applicant had not mitigated the remaining four SOR allegations which\nincluded three delinquencies totaling almost $40,000.  The Judge noted the roughly $7,000 to $8,000\nof annual gambling losses could have been more wisely spent reducing some of the SOR debts. \nDiscussion\nApplicant correctly notes the Judge erred in stating Applicant pays child support for one\nchild when he in fact paid child support for all three of his children.  The Judge aptly described the\ncircumstances that led to the child support arrearage as convoluted.  The Judge ultimately found\nApplicant\u2019s child support arrearage arose from conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control and that he\nhad acted responsibly under the circumstances given he \u201chad physical of custody of the three\nchildren\u201d while paying their expenses and child support at the same time.   Decision at 8.  The Judge\ncorrectly noted Applicant\u2019s testimony that his girlfriend did not receive child support for her three\n2\n\nchildren, two of whom were still residing with her.  Other than that, Applicant does not challenge\nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  While the Judge erred in a finding of fact about the number of children\nApplicant supported, the error did not affect the outcome of the case.  We conclude, therefore, this\nidentified error was harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.15-04850 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2018). \nApplicant has not cited to a harmful error in the Judge\u2019s decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nApril 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 21, 2018, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 40 years old, has been an employee of a defense contractor since 2001. \nShe has earned a master\u2019s degree.  Her annual salary is about $124,000.  Her work performance has\nbeen outstanding, and she has received numerous awards at work.  She is married.  Her husband\u2019s\nannual salary is about $45,000.  She has two children and a stepchild.  Her oldest child is a college\nstudent. \nApplicant experienced financial problems while raising a child as a single mother.  She did\nnot receive financial assistance from the child\u2019s father.  At that time, her student loans went into a\ndeferment status, and she did not know they were transferred to another company.  When she\nreceived letters from the company holding the loans, she thought they were solicitations to\nconsolidate the loans and did not respond to them.  In 2014, $1,200 of her monthly wages (more than\nher monthly mortgage payment) was involuntarily garnished to pay the student loans.  She was\nunsuccessful in her efforts to lower the garnishment.  While her wages were being garnished, she\nwas unable to pay other debts.  In late 2017, her student loan debt of $43,000 was paid completely\nthrough the garnishment.  Additionally, her mother passed away in 2017, and she paid the funeral\nexpenses.\n   \nBesides the resolved garnishment/student loans, the SOR alleged that Applicant had 26 other\ndelinquent accounts.  In her SOR response, she admitted all, but two, of the alleged debts.1  Her SOR\nresponse claimed she paid some of the debts and would pay others in late 2017, but provided no\ndocumentation of those payments.  She also asserted that she had a payoff plan to address 24\ndelinquent debts totaling about $40,200.  The payoff plan was to start three months after the hearing. \n1 In her SOR response, Applicant stated the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.bb (two defaulted student loans) were\nduplicates of the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (garnishment for student loans).  Applicant neither admitted nor denied the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.bb.\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit report from early 2018 reflected she made some payments on a delinquent\ncredit card account.2  She also provided documentation showing she made five payments to creditors\ntotaling $180.  Additionally, when she learned her child\u2019s tuition was not fully funded, she stopped\nmaking payments to some of the alleged creditors.  \nAt some point, Applicant obtained the services of a credit correction company that sent\nletters disputing each of the SOR debts.  She had 34 negative accounts removed from her credit\nreport; however, there is no indication she made any payments on those accounts.  She also testified\nthat she had been \u201ckind of lackadaisical\u201d in paying off previous debts, but is aggressively trying to\nresolve the debts now that she is aware they affect her job.  Decision at 6, quoting from Tr. at 73. \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant experienced some conditions beyond her control.  An involuntary garnishment\nprevented her from making payments on other financial obligations.  She presented documentation\nof making only five payment totaling $180 towards the alleged debts after the garnishment ended\nin late 2017.  In her SOR response, she indicated that she had established certain repayment plans,\nbut nine months later provided no evidence that payments had been made under them.  Since the\ngarnishment, she has not acted responsibly in addressing her debts.  Numerous debts remain\nunresolved.  \nDiscussion    \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states the Judge agreed to a proposed repayment plan at the\nhearing and notes that payments toward certain debts under that plan would start in May 2019.3  The\ntranscript does not support her contention that the Judge agreed to such a proposed plan.  Moreover,\nDOHA is not a debt collection agency, and DOHA Judges have no authority to approve an\napplicant\u2019s debt repayment plan.  In this case, the Judge correctly stated in his analysis that\nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other\nresponsible approaches, citing ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3, n.3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013).  \nAdditionally, Applicant argues she disputed certain debts that no longer appear on her credit report. \nIn the findings of fact, the Judge noted that Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts, but she\ndisputed all of them through a credit correction company, and provided no proof of payments on\nthose negative accounts.  In his analysis, the Judge correctly stated the Appeal Board has observed\nthat debts dropping off an applicant\u2019s credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution,\n2 The credit report reflected the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $528 was reduced to $297.  Decision at 5. \n3 Applicant appears to be referring to the Judge\u2019s discussion of leaving the record open for a period for her to\nsubmit additional documentation.  Tr. at 13-16.  While the discourse may have confused her, it did not constitute an\nagreement to any plan, especially since no plan had been presented.  \n3\n\nciting ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016).  As we previously stated, there may\nbe more than one plausible explanation for the absence of debts from a credit report, including the\npassage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05197 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2004).  Furthermore,\nApplicant indicates that she paid certain debts.  The Judge, however, concluded that she provided\ninsufficient proof of payments toward the alleged debts.  The Appeal Board has previously noted\nit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the resolution of\nspecific debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016).  Applicant has not\nidentified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  For example, she disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has shown\ninsufficient progress toward resolving the alleged debts.  These arguments, however, are not\nsufficient to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).    \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On July 19, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his conclusion\nabout Applicant\u2019s conduct and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s found in favor of Applicant on all of the Guideline F allegations and\none Guideline E allegation.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in her early 40s, is employed by a defense contractor overseas.  She served\nin the military for about four years and received an honorable discharge.  She is divorced with\nteenage children.  She has earned an associate\u2019s degree.    \nThe Judge found against Applicant on related SOR allegations.  These asserted that Applicant\nwas cited for prostitution and operating a business without a licence in 2017, that she engaged in sex\nwith strangers she met on websites, that her website posted she charged certain amounts of money\nfor specific periods of time, and that one man she met online paid her $80 following sex.  In\nresponding to the SOR, Applicant denied those allegations.   The Judge made the following findings:\nFor about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant\u2019s semi-nude photographs\nand contact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70;\nGE 5)  Her time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes.  (Tr.\n61-63)  She offered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and a special event to her\ncustomers.  (Tr. 61-62, 74)  In April 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued\na press release indicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was\n1 DoD initially issued the SOR on April 16, 2018.  \n2\n\nseized, as it was \u201cthe dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where\nsex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike.\u201d  (Tr. 77; GE 9).\nOn March 11, 2017, the police stopped a vehicle that had just left Applicant\u2019s\nresidence.  (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation.  The\ndriver said he had just paid Applicant $80 for sex.  He said he also paid her $150 for\nsex on March 8, 2017.  (OPM ROI at 17).  The police went to Applicant\u2019s residence\nand asked for the money the witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills.  Id. \nApplicant told the police that she was not engaging in prostitution.  The police\ninterviewed another witness who was a soldier at a nearby military installation, and\nhe said he paid for sex about four times at Applicant\u2019s residence.  Id.  (police report) \nApplicant\u2019s lawyer said she was unable to locate the two witnesses cited in the police \nreport to challenge their credibility.  (Tr. 45-46)  When Applicant was questioned by\nthe police, she \u201cwas concerned about the charges of prostitution as it would affect her\nsecurity clearance.\u201d  (GE 4)\nApplicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time;\nhowever, she estimated \u201cat least see[ing] 40 or more.\u201d  (Tr. 64-66)  She estimated\nthat she had sex with about 20 men.  (Tr. 66-67)   She was vague about how many\nof them paid after having sex with her.  (Tr. 67-68)  Some of the customers may have\nasked her for drugs; however, she always refused to give them drugs.  (Tr. 88) \nApplicant did not have anyone to protect her if the date with her customers became\nviolent.  (Tr. 87)\nApplicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution.  (Tr. 43, 47-\n48)  She denied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and\nthe sexual activity.  (Tr. 82; SR; GE 2)   The purpose of the semi-nudity on her\nwebsite was to encourage men to call her to go out with her.  (Tr. 70)  After the first\ndate, some men continued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and\nsome did not pay her.  (Tr. 71, 82)  As for whether she was soliciting prostitution,\nApplicant explained, in an advertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a\nbikini, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a prostitute.\u201d   (Tr. 93)  Applicant held a security\nclearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period when her website advertised her time to\ncustomers.  (Tr. 75)  [Decision at 5-6.]\nApplicant\u2019s prostitution charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.  After receiving her\ncitation, she stopped seeing customers from the website.  Applicant believes her former husband was\nvindictive and called the police alleging she was engaged in prostitution.  In 2016, she earned about\n$5,000 from her website activity that she did not declare on her Federal income tax return.  She did\nnot report her arrest to her facility security officer until after her background interview.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n3\n\n\u201cEach time [Applicant] engaged in sexual activity and received payment afterwards at this\nhourly rate from her customers, she committed a form of the prostitution offense.\u201d  Decision at 11.\nNone of the mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, J, and E fully apply.  Her multiple\nmisdemeanor-level prostitution offenses are relatively recent.  She has refused to admit she engaged\nin conduct that constituted prostitution. \nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that she engaged\nin a form of prostitution.  She emphasizes that the prostitution citation was dismissed for lack of\nevidence.  She argues \u201cthe evidence suggests that she never engaged in the exchange of money for\nsex as the money was for dates and massages.  Any sexual behavior engaged in by the [Applicant]\nwas strictly consensual and a decision made regardless of any money exchanging hands.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 11.  In challenging the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant engaged in prostitution, we note\nthat Applicant has not disputed any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact supporting that\nconclusion.2  Furthermore, the dismissal of a charge or citation does not establish innocence and does\nnot preclude a Judge from concluding the offense was committed based on his or her examination\nof the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  Considering the\nevidence as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion is based on\nsubstantial evidence and constitutes a reasonable characterization or inference that can be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  The Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion is sustainable.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 16-\n02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence and\nmisapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  She argues, for example, that two\nyears have passed since her conduct at issue and that she took responsibility by admitting that she\npresented herself in a poor manner. Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither enough to rebut the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal\nBoard nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed\nto establish the Judge committed harmful error.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On May\n16, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 14, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E were not\nraised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed further below.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 58 years old, has worked for her current employer since 2015.  Before her\ncurrent employment, she worked as a contractor and has held a security clearance for about 15 years. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on three of six Guideline F allegations.  She found against\nApplicant on two state tax liens totaling over $20,000 and a medical debt of $560.  \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment, including while working for her current\nemployer.  She indicated that she received bad advice from an accountant about the filing of her self-\nemployment tax returns.  She also suffered a stroke at work that was not covered by health insurance. \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted for a state tax lien of about $7,300.  While two state\ntax liens are alleged in the SOR, she claimed she has only one state tax lien in the approximate\namount of $13,100.  She provided a 2018 state document showing she owes a balance of about\n$4,700 for tax year 2007 and about $9,000 for tax year 2009.  She attributed the past-due taxes to\ninaccurate tax filings by her accountant.  In 2011, she began making $400 payments, but it was not\nclear from the record to whom she was making those payments.  At one point, checks torn in half\nwere returned to her.  In 2018, she agreed to a 60-month payment plan with the state.  Under that\nagreement, she was to make a initial payment of $1,374 and then monthly payments of $235.  She\nhas not started making the payments because her husband had a massive heart attack, and she is the\nonly one employed.   \nApplicant stated that she was making payments on the delinquent medical account, but\nprovided no proof of those payments.  In her post-hearing submission, she provided a receipt for\n$480; however, it was not clear to whom the payment was made.  She also volunteered that she owed\nabout $8,000 in Federal taxes for 2017 and an unspecified amount in state taxes for that same year. \nShe again attributed the 2017 tax delinquencies to her old accountant; however, she has hired a new\naccountant.  \nWhile Applicant experienced conditions beyond her control, she has not acted responsibly\nto address her debts.  More specifically, she did not produce sufficient information to show that she\n2\n\nhas been proactive in her actions.  While she settled a Federal tax lien, she has not started payments\non others.  She has not shown that her financial problems are under control. \nDiscussion    \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that she made payments towards the state tax liens \nthrough a collection agency and that she settled the medical debt through a third-party corporation. \nThe Judge discussed those claimed payments in the decision, indicating for both the state tax liens\nand the medical debt that it was not clear to whom Applicant made the payments.1  The Judge\u2019s\nfindings regarding state tax liens are generally consistent with the evidence in the record.  They are\nbased upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences therefrom.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018).  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\ndid not produce sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns arising from the two state\ntax liens is sustainable.  As the Board has previously stated, it is reasonable for Judge to expect\napplicants to present documentation showing that debts have been resolved or are being resolved. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008).  The balance of Applicant\u2019s\narguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not\nsufficient to establish harmful error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10,\n2018).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of\nthe national security.\u201d\n1 Some comments regarding the claimed payments merit noting.\na.  In her post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that she was providing a receipt from a collection agency\nfor $448 showing the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was paid.  The Judge found \u201cApplicant provided a receipt for $480, but\nit was not clear to whom it was paid.\u201d  Decision at 3.  In the record, we are unable to find a receipt for either $448 or\n$480.  \nb.  In discussing the $400 state tax lien payments, the Judge stated, \u201cbut it was not clear from the record that\nthe payment was going to the IRS.\u201d  Decision at 3.  At the hearing, Applicant indicated that payments were going to an\nunspecified collection company.  Tr. at 22.   In the appeal brief, Applicant states the payments were going to a collection\nagency, not the IRS. \nEven though the Judge may have erred in failing to include the receipt for either $488 or $480 in the record and may have \nerred in referring to the IRS regarding the state tax lien payments, these were harmless errors because they did not likely\naffect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  As discussed above,\nthe unresolved state tax liens are sufficient to sustain the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision.  \n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nthe Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nrebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at\n3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;\nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs\ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference\nof opinion.  Id.\nAt the outset, we note Department Counsel\u2019s arguments are of mixed merit.  She repeats an\nargument that the Board has rejected at least twice, i.e., \u201cMitigating Conditions 20(d) and 20(g) must\nbe read in concert and harmony with the overall parameters of analysis set forth by the Appeal\nBoard.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 13.  This is not accurate.  As we have previously stated, \u201cThe Appeal Board \nand Hearing Office Judges are creatures of the Directive.  While some analysis and precedents might\nsurvive amendments to the Directive or guidelines, it is mistaken to believe that the guidelines are\nsomehow inferior to the Appeal Board\u2019s decisions.  More succinctly, the provisions of the Directive,\nincluding the guidelines, are controlling.\u201d   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4, n.2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 29, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018).  Furthermore,\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s relevant arguments rely entirely on case law that predates the current\nguidelines without any acknowledgment that the content of the new guidelines may have narrowed\nor superceded the prior case law.  \nThat said, Department Counsel\u2019s other arguments, such as her contention that the Judge did\nnot consider important aspects of the case, are meritorious.  She points out that the Judge failed to\naddress that Applicant did not file his Federal income tax return for 2009 as required.  His 2009 IRS\ntax transcript reflects that the IRS filed a substitute tax return for him in early February 2012 and\n3\n\ndetermined he owed an additional $44,731 of taxes for that tax year.2  AE N.  She also notes that\nApplicant changed his W-4 exemptions to \u201cten\u201d for  2011.   Tr. at 37.  Due to that change in\nexemptions, Applicant testified \u201cthey weren\u2019t taking any taxes out\u201d of his pay.  Id.  He used the extra\nmoney to purchase a custom motorcycle, which was an item on his \u201cbucket list.\u201d  Id. and 65-66. \nWhen analyzing a case, a Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated\nor piecemeal manner that focuses only on matters favorable to one party.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-05005 at 8 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017).  In this case, the Judge erred by failing to analyze\nsignificant matters that undermined his mitigation analysis.  \nDepartment Counsel also challenges that Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s recent\ninstallment agreement mitigates the security concerns arising from his past-due taxes for 2009 and\n2011.  First, she argues the Judge erred in failing to address the timing of Applicant\u2019s actions to\naddress his tax deficiencies.  As we have previously stated, a Judge may consider the underlying\ncircumstances of tax debt in evaluating an applicant\u2019s reliability and judgment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-00378 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2018).  Furthermore, an applicant who resolves financial\nproblems after being placed on notice his or her security clearance was in jeopardy may lack the\njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate\nthreat to his own interests.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 IRS tax transcript reflects that he made one $100 payment towards his 2009 tax\ndeficiency before the SOR was issued in March 2017.  AE N.  After issuance of the SOR, he made\nsporadic payments and submitted an Offer in Compromise (which was later withdrawn) before he\nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS one month prior to the hearing.  In her brief,\nDepartment Counsel also points out that Applicant has been consistently employed since 2005 (with\nthe exception of a four-month period in 2009-2010), and he had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of\nabout $117,000 in 2014.3  Additionally, Department Counsel notes that Applicant only submitted\nproof of one payment under the installment agreement, which was made after the hearing was held. \nShe argues that proof of one payment under a 62-month installment plan is less than convincing\nevidence that Applicant was adhering to or in compliance with the installment agreement.4     \n2 Applicant\u2019s 2009 IRS tax transcript also reflects that his tax return for that year was received on February 14,\n2012.\n3 Tr. at 35-36, Government Exhibit 1, and AE N.  Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts reflect that he filed as \u201cSingle\u201d\nfor 2009-2011 and his AGI for those years ranged from about $47,400 to $78,100; he filed as \u201cHead of Household\u201d for\n2012 and his AGI was about $51,600; he filed as \u201cMarried Filing Joint\u201d for 2013 and 2014 and his AGI for those years\nwas about $83,700 and $117,000; and he filed as \u201cMarried Filing Separate\u201d for 2015 and 2016 and his AGI for those\nyears was about $53,300 and $44,700.    \n4 In the decision, the Judge failed to identify the specific mitigating conditions that applied.  He noted five\nmitigating conditions were potentially applicable.  Those mitigating conditions are set forth in Directive , Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(d) and (g) as follows:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n4\n\n\u201cNational security eligibility determinations take into account a person's stability,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, and judgment.\u201d  Directive , Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6 1(b).   Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with\nabiding by well-established government rules and regulations.  Voluntary compliance with rules and\nregulations is essential for protecting classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at\n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016).  In this case, Applicant failed to address his significant 2009 Federal\nincome tax debt for a number of years and did so only after his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nSuch a failure raises questions about whether he has demonstrated the high degree of judgment and\nreliability that is required for granting an individual access to classified information.  \n \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider important aspects of the case and\nruns contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record\nevidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under\nthe Egan standard.\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death,\ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a\nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts; [and]\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the\namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\nAs written, the Judge\u2019s decision leaves us guessing which mitigating conditions he concluded either fully or partially\napplied.  This was error.  As we have previously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the\nparties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018).\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

He hired a lawyer to assist him in a dispute with child protective services, occasioned by his wife\u2019s difficulties.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 25, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge denied him due process;\nwhether the Judge raised concerns not included in the SOR; whether the Judge placed improper\nlimitations on Applicant\u2019s evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue\nin this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant has a history of\nsignificant delinquent debt, including back taxes owed the Federal Government.  While they were\nmarried, Applicant\u2019s now ex-wife had many personal problems, for which Applicant paid for\ncounseling and medical treatment.  He hired a lawyer to assist him in a dispute with child protective\nservices, occasioned by his wife\u2019s difficulties.

He did not provide documentation from\nthe IRS showing how much he previously paid and how much he still owes.

Applicant stated that his financial problems stabilized after his bankruptcy\ndischarge.  However, in 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was evicted from her home and moved in with\ntheir daughter.  Applicant provided his wife and daughter with financial support, as he did for his\ntwo other children.  He did so at the expense of paying his own debts.\nThe Judge found that some of the debts alleged in the SOR were duplicates of others or were\nnot substantiated.  He also found that some of the SOR debts had been resolved but that a number \nhad not been, including those to the IRS.  Applicant has received financial counseling and is making\n2\n\npayments on a plan proposed by \u201ca noted financial advisor.\u201d  Decision at 3.  In addition, he is\nworking additional jobs, maintains a budget, and is setting aside funds for emergency situations.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems raised three disqualifying\nconditions: inability to satisfy debts, a history of not meeting financial obligations, and failure to file\nor fraudulently filing tax returns or failure to pay income tax as required.1  The Judge noted\ncircumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected his financial problems, such as his family\u2019s\nmedical expenses and unexpected car repairs.  However, he also concluded that Applicant had not\nprovided sufficient corroborating evidence to show that he had acted responsibly in resolving his\ndebts.  Though noting his debt resolution plan, the Judge stated that it constituted nothing more than\na promise to resolve debts in the future rather than a track record of debt payment.  He also stated\nthat, \u201c[f]or whatever reason, Applicant has left me in the dark about his taxes,\u201d noting a paucity of\ncorroborating evidence concerning the amounts paid, the amount yet owed, etc.  Decision at 7.  The\nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing and continue to cast\ndoubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nDiscussion\nApplicant has raised some due process issues. He notes that the Judge applied adjudicative\nguidelines that were effective as of June 8, 2017,  after the date of his SOR.  He argues that the\nJudge should have applied the guidelines in effect on the date of his SOR.  However, as Department\nCounsel states in his Reply Brief, the DoD has implemented Security Executive Agent Directive 4,\nmandating that all adjudications will utilize the new guidelines.  This requirement applies without\nregard to the date of an SOR.  See ISCR Case No. 15-02728 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2018).2 \nApplicant received notice of this, both from the Department Counsel and from the Chief Hearing\nOffice Judge, along with copies of the appropriate guidelines.  Applicant also contends that DOHA\nunduly delayed convening his hearing until after his 2017 taxes were due, thereby prompting the\nJudge to inquire into their status to his detriment.  However, it was Applicant himself who broached\nhis 2016 and 2017 tax filings.  Tr. at 58.

PURPOSE:  This\nSecurity Executive Agent (SecEA) Directive establishes the single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered\nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive\nposition.  The Guidelines reflected herein supercede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or\nguidelines. . . .   E. POLICY: 1. The National Security Adjudicative Guidelines in Appendix A shall be used by all\nauthorized adjudicative agencies when rendering a determination for initial or continued eligibility for access to classified\ninformation or initial or continued eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . .

EFFECTIVE DATE: This\nDirective becomes effective 180 days after the date of signature.\u201d [It was signed on 10 December 2016.]\n3\n\nsubsequent tax years had not been considered the Judge would have arrived at a different decision.3 \nThere is no reason to conclude that the timing of the hearing prejudiced Applicant\u2019s ability to\npresent his case for mitigation.  Accordingly, we have no authority to comment on the manner in\nwhich officials have processed Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-12730 at 2 (App. Bd.\nSep. 4, 2013).  Applicant was not denied due process.\nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly considered matters that were not alleged in the\nSOR, specifically information about his 2016 and 2017 income tax returns.  Again, it was Applicant\nwho introduced the subject of his subsequent returns.  Moreover, it was not improper for the Judge\nto have considered this matter, insofar as non-alleged conduct can be relevant on issues of\nmitigation, rehabilitation, the whole-person analysis, etc.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).  Our review of the Decision and of the record as a whole persuades us\nthat the Judge considered this evidence in its proper context.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly limited the evidence that he wished to submit. \nHe argues that, by commenting upon a paucity of documentary corroboration, the Judge discounted\nhis hearing testimony, thereby imposing an evidentiary standard not found within the Directive. \nHowever, it is reasonable to expect an applicant to present corroborating documentation of his\nefforts at debt resolution.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  In a\nDOHA proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have access\nto classified information, and corroborating evidence can go a long way toward enabling an\napplicant to meet that burden.  We note that the Judge admitted all documents that Applicant\nproffered, and we find nowhere in the transcript that the Judge curtailed his testimony.  Indeed, he\nkept the record open for four months after the hearing, over Department Counsel\u2019s objection.  Tr.\npp. 84-86, 91.  Applicant appears to be arguing that the Judge should have extended more weight\nto his testimony that was apparently the case, which is not the same thing as demonstrating the Judge\nprevented him from submitting evidence itself.  The Judge did not limit Applicant\u2019s ability to\npresent his case in mitigation.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nIn making this argument, he asserts that the Judge erred in concluding that his circumstances raised\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.  In addition to his claim that the Judge relied upon the wrong\nset of guidelines, which we have already rejected, he contends that his financial problems were\nunfortunate but did not raise security concerns in the absence of any \u201caggravating factors.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 12.  There is no support for Applicant\u2019s argument about aggravating factors.  The Directive\nimposes no such requirement.  To the contrary, the Directive provides that delinquent debts\nthemselves can raise concerns about an applicant\u2019s willingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nthereby giving rise to questions about his or her ability to protect classified information.  Directive,\nEncl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18.; ISCR Case No. 15-01737 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14,  2017).  Indeed, the\n3Applicant\u2019s argument is predicated, in part, on the premise that failure to pay taxes would not have been\nincluded in Statements of Reasons under the old guidelines.  This premise is mistaken.  For two examples of cases under\nthose guidelines in which failure to pay taxes was a security issue (without a failure to file component) see ISCR Case\n09-07064 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011) and ISCR Case No. 14-05489 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2016).\n4\n\nDirective presumes that there is a nexus between admitted or proved conduct or circumstances under\nany of the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018).  Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt and\nin particular his debt to the IRS are sufficient to raise security concerns, thereby shifting the burden\nof production to Applicant.  The balance of Applicant\u2019s brief is, in effect, a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  However, an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the record\nis not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nIn support of his arguments, Applicant refers to the \u201cimminent threat to the national interest\u201d\nstandard set forth in Directive \u00b6 6.4,4 which applies to the suspension of a previously adjudicated\nsecurity clearance pending a final clearance decision.  Applicant\u2019s reliance on \u00b6 6.4 is misplaced. \nFirst, his security clearance was not suspended under \u00b6 6.4.  Second, the \u201cimminent threat to the\nnational security\u201d standard is for use by the appropriate DoD official in reviewing a proposed\nsecurity clearance suspension and not for use by Judges in adjudicating security clearance eligibility. \nThird, the Judge\u2019s decision in this case is an integral part of and, depending on the circumstances,\ncould constitute the final clearance decision.5  See, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.36.  See also, ISCR Case No.\n14-05238 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 13, 2016) for the proposition that \u00b6 6.4 is limited in scope and that as\na general matter the Government does not have to prove a \u201c\u2018clear and present danger\u2019 to national\nsecurity\u201d before it can deny an applicant a clearance.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in\nfavor of the national security.\u201d\n4 In his argument Applicant refers to \u00b6 6.4 and uses the phrase \u201cimminent threat to national security\u201d instead\nof \u201cimminent threat to the national interest\u201d as set forth in that provision.

Norman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n5, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On November 27, 2018, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Caroline E. Heintzelman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has used marijuana in the recent past.  He began doing so in 2008, in order to\nrelieve pain caused by a knee ailment, and a few years later he began growing it himself.  In his\nsecurity clearance application (SCA)  he advised that he used marijuana until May 2015.  Although\nhe claimed in his SCA that he would not do so again, in fact he later told his interviewer that he used\nit twice between August 2015 and January 2017.  On this last occasion he used marijuana with\nfriends \u201cbecause it was there.\u201d  Decision at 3.  From February 2012 until June 2015 Applicant\nmisused various prescription medications, such as morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, Oxycontin,\ntramadol, suboxone, xanax, Ativan, amphetetamines, Ritalin, and soma.  He stated that he stopped\nusing controlled substances after consultation with a health care provider.  He stated that he would\nnever have abused drugs if he had known the effect it would have on his clearance, and he signed\na statement of intent never to re-offend.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of controlled substances constituted a pattern of behavior that impugns\nhis willingness to follow rules and regulations.  Even though Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred off\nduty, it reflects poor judgment and raises questions about his fitness for access to classified\ninformation.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief alludes to the time that it has taken to adjudicate his SCA.

He draws our attention to various pieces\nof record evidence that support his effort to obtain a favorable decision, for example documents\nsubstantiating his medical problems, his statement of intent not to misuse drugs in the future, his\nexplanations for his security-significant conduct, etc.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).  Applicant requests that he be granted a clearance\naccompanied by a warning against future misconduct.  However, this is appropriate only when an\n2\n\napplicant\u2019s circumstances are not serious enough to warrant an adverse decision.  See Directive,\nEncl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(h).  Given the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, neither the Judge\nnor other officials erred by failing to apply this procedure.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings and\nconclusions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in his mid-50s, has worked for his current employer for about six years. \nHe has multiple post-graduate degrees.  He is retired from the military Reserves and has suffered\nfrom Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  \nIn 2007, Federal law enforcement agencies conducted an investigation that identified\nindividuals, including some with DoD affiliations, who subscribed to known child pornography\nwebsites.  As part of that investigation, Applicant\u2019s home was searched.  He admitted viewing adult-\ncontent websites, but no pornographic images of minors were found.  Past military orders were \nfound.1  He claimed someone gave him permission to have the orders but was unable to provide that\nindividual\u2019s name.  He was issued a written warning for mishandling classified information.\nIn late 2010, the earlier investigation was reopened because some investigative leads were\ninsufficiently examined.  In 2011, Applicant was again investigated.  A laboratory had lost evidence\nfrom 2007 and inspected new material.  Additionally, a mix-up led to a hard drive not belonging to\nApplicant being made part of the investigation.   During an interview, Applicant was asked about\na website he had visited and chose to end the interview.  His access to classified information was\nsuspended in 2012.  Four to six questionable images were discovered on Applicant\u2019s media.  Two\nof them \u201cwere identified as containing known child victims identified by the National Center for\nMissing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\u201d  Decision at 3.  Federal and local authorities declined\nto prosecute.  In 2013, however, Applicant was issued a general officer letter of reprimand for having\nchild pornography and unsecured classified information in his home.  Soon after the reprimand\nbecame final, Applicant was transferred to the retired Reserves with the recommendation his security\nclearance be revoked.  \nHaving viewed the images uncovered during the investigation, Applicant disputes that they\nconstitute child pornography.  He testified that he had never seen those images before.  While some\n1 At the hearing, Applicant testified the documents were marked Secret and included an annex to an operations\norder.  Tr. at 159.\n2\n\nof the images reflected nude and scantily clothed individuals, he argued none were engaged in sexual\nactivity and, therefore, could not be deemed child pornography.  He acknowledged that his reputation\nwould be harmed if issues regarding his sexual behavior became public knowledge. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nLaw enforcement agencies linked Applicant to known child pornography websites through \ncredit card transactions.   After the investigation was reopened and he was asked about specific web-\nsites, Applicant quit cooperating with investigators.  \u201cWhat was deemed to be child pornography was\nfound,\u201d but civilian authorities declined to prosecute.  Decision at 4.   The military found that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d and issued him a formal reprimand and\nrecommend his security clearance be revoked.  His sexual behavior has become a concern for\nexploitation and could affect his reputation in the community.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s continued protestation that the material at issue was not child pornography,\ndespite the fact this is not the forum to appeal previous findings by [a law enforcement agency] and\nthe military, makes it difficult to judge whether such behavior could recur.\u201d  Decision at 5.  The\nevidence brings into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and current reliability.  He is not in treatment\nnor has he recently completed such a program.  None of the sexual behavior mitigating conditions\napply.  \n\u201cApplicant admits public knowledge of the facts involved would harm his reputation.\u201d \nDecision at 6.  Additionally, sensitive or protected information was found on his personal media in\n2007.   His conduct reflects poor judgment and a lack of trustworthiness.  He has not established that\nsome similar conduct will not occur in the future.  Pertinent personal conduct mitigating conditions\ndo not apply.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel challenges some of the Judge\u2019s finding and conclusions.  For example,\nhe contends that there was evidence that the child pornography was not the property of Applicant. \nThis claim is based on Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that another person\u2019s hard drive\nbecame mixed with his evidence at the laboratory.  Tr. at 31, 33, 66-68, and 86-91.  There is no\nmention of this supposed mix-up in the investigative reports that are in evidence.  Government\nExhibits 3 and 5.  Moreover, when Applicant was asked at the hearing whether there was any\nindication that the child pornography images at issue came from the other person\u2019s hard drive, he\nresponded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  Tr. at 91.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel also argues that Mitigating Condition\n14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress) should apply\nbecause \u201cthere was never a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress as all [his] family members and\n[his] close friends are privy to this information, as well as [his] previous employer when these\nallegation were levied.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 9.  Of note, the statement that all of Applicant\u2019s family and\nfriends are privy to information about the alleged conduct is not supported by the evidence.  Further, \nApplicant testified that, if negative information was published about him, it might hurt his reputation\n(Tr. at 141) and that no one at his current job knows about the possession of child pornography\n3\n\nallegation (Tr. at 142).  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions\nare based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel argues Applicant\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified material was\npreviously adjudicated and resulted in him being granted a security clearance with a warning.   To\nthe extent that Applicant\u2019s Counsel is arguing the Government is equitably estopped from\nreconsidering that matter, we do not find his argument persuasive.  Applicant was granted the\nsecurity clearance with a warning after the investigation first closed and before the child pornography\nwas discovered when it was reopened.  In other words, additional security concerns came to light\nafter the security clearance was granted.  As we have previously stated, a prior decision to grant a\nsecurity clearance to an applicant does not give the applicant any vested right or entitlement in\nkeeping a security clearance.  Nor would it preclude the Federal Government from considering at\na future date whether to continue that grant or revoke it.  Furthermore, the Federal Government is\nnot equitably estopped from denying or revoking a security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0519 at 15 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  \n Applicant\u2019s Counsel asserts that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence  and\nmisapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For example, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\ncontends \u201cthe [Judge failed] to properly take into account [Applicant\u2019s] whole person concept, the\nunique circumstances associated with the 2007 and 2011 investigations, the complete lack of review\nof material psychological evidence, the fact that three (3) different State and Federal prosecutors\ndeclined to prosecute [Applicant] for deficient evidence, and the fact that these incidents occurred\napproximately twelve (12) years ago without any repeat behavior.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 12-13.  Of note,\nthe Appeal Board has declined to establish a \"bright-line\" test regarding the concept of recency.  The\nconclusion of the Judge that past misconduct still remains a security concern must be evaluated\nthrough careful consideration of the totality of the specific record at hand.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n99-0018 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000).   Applicant\u2019s reliance on the age of the misconduct is\nundercut by the fact that currently Applicant denies that he has viewed or possessed child\npornography.  When an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his or her own\nactions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997).  Moreover, regarding the claim by\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel that the psychological evidence was not reviewed, we note Applicant asserted\nthe doctor-patient privilege when Department Counsel asked him if he told his treatment providers\nthat he was found to be in possession of child pornography.  Tr. at 120-124, 144-145, and 153.  In\naddressing Applicant\u2019s assertion of the doctor-patient privilege, the Judge noted that Applicant\noffered into evidence a letter from a psychiatrist discussing Applicant\u2019s mental heath diagnoses\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) L) and stated, \u201cI can give it [AE L] the appropriate weight if there is\nnothing more behind it.\u201d  Tr. at 123-124.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s statement that he could\ndetermine the appropriate weight that AE L should be accorded.  Furthermore, a Judge is not\nrequired to discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01500 at\n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015).  Overall, the arguments of Applicant\u2019s Counsel are neither enough to\nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\n4\n\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  We give due consideration to the\nHearing Office case that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the\nAppeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed\nto establish the Judge committed harmful error.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Berry, Esq.\nMelissa L. Watkins, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 30, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May\n1, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nPhilip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\nfindings of fact and whether the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is in his late-40s and is married with two children.  He was born in Egypt and\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree there.  He entered the United States in the late 2000s, became a U.S.\ncitizen in 2015, and later earned a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university.  He has worked on Federal \nGovernment projects, including [Redacted]. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has foreign family members and foreign financial interests. \nThose family members include his mother, siblings, mother-in-law, and siblings-in-law who are\ncitizens and residents of Egypt.  His mother and one sibling-in-law served as professionals in an\nEgyptian government ministry and are now retired.  Another sibling-in-law continues to serve as a\nprofessional in that same government ministry.  One of his siblings is a teacher in a private school;\nanother is a [Redacted] for the Egyptian government.  His financial interests in Egypt include\nownership of interests in three properties, bank accounts, and bank certificates.  His spouse also\nmaintains some bank accounts in Egypt.  Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations.\nApplicant speaks to his mother about once a week and visits her about once a year.  He speaks to his\nsiblings about every two to four weeks and sees them when he visits his mother.  His siblings knew\nthat at some point he was working on one Federal project.  He speaks to his in-laws periodically\n.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets totaled about $354,000.  He sold one of\nthe properties shortly before the hearing.  Applicant estimated that another property was worth about\nhalf of the SOR-listed amount of  $125,000.  He wants to keep this property so that he could use it\nduring visits.  Applicant\u2019s equity in another property is about $3,500.  He closed his two bank\naccounts in Egypt.  Due to depreciation of the Egyptian currency, his foreign bank certificates and\nsavings bonds are about $6,000, instead of the alleged amount of $16,000.  His children have bank\ncertificates in Egypt worth about $8,000.  His spouse\u2019s Egyptian bank holdings, which were alleged\nto total about $64,000, now are about $25,000.  Due to either liquidation or depreciation, the value\nof his Egyptian assets now range from about $149,000 to $163,500.  Applicant and his spouse both\nhave six-figure salaries.  He estimates his U.S. assets total about $1.7 million.  He provided\nreferences that vouch for his exemplary character. \n2\n\nSince 1979, Egypt and the United States have maintained strong economic and security ties. \nThe U.S. State Department has warned U.S. citizens of the risks of terrorism in Egypt.  Several\nterrorist groups, including ISIS, have committed deadly attacks there, including the targeting of\ngovernment officials.  Such attacks are likely to continue.  Egypt has a record of human rights\nabuses.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s family members and financial interests in Egypt created a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation.  His assets in Egypt, however, have substantially decreased since the SOR was\nissued.  His current Egyptian assets, totaling about $163,000, are less than 1% of his U.S. assets.1 \nThe value of his foreign assets are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively\nto influence or pressure him.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother is elderly and does not know that he works on U.S. Government projects. \nHis contacts with his siblings are less frequent.  With the exception of his one sibling, \u201cnone of these\nrelatives have any ties to the government or military.\u201d  Decision at 10.  \u201cNor do any of these relatives\n(including the [sibling] working for the [government]) know that Applicant is seeking a security\nclearance or the details of what his job entails.  Applicant has been very assiduous in not providing\nany details about his work to his Egyptian relatives.  I do not find the frequency of Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with his Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns.\u201d  Id.   \nApplicant arrived in the United States in the late-2000s and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. \nHe is in the process of selling his current home and buying another valued at $950,000.  He testified\ncredibly that, if he learned that one of his family members was being exploited, he would report it\nto appropriate authorities.  He has established himself as a solid U.S. citizen.  He has deep loyalty\nto the United States and would resolve any conflict in favor of the United States.    \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \n1 We note that, based on the Judge\u2019s findings, the current calculation is over 9%.\n3\n\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).\nDepartment Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis.  At the outset, it merits\nnoting the Judge reached inconsistent conclusions regarding whether security concerns were created\ndue to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign family members.  In his analysis, the Judge initially\nstated:\nApplicant has connections to his mother, his [siblings], and his in-laws, who are all\ncitizens and residents of Egypt.  There is an articulated heightened risk associated\nwith having ties to family members in Egypt, due to the activities of terrorist\norganizations and insurgents operating within its borders.  In addition, Applicant had\nover $350,000 in Egypt, between real estate and bank accounts, when the SOR was\nissued.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the . . . disqualifying conditions [in\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f).]  [Decision at 9.]  \nThe Judge later contradicts a portion of that conclusion by stating, \u201cI do not find the frequency of\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns.\u201d \nDecision at 10.  It is error for the Judge to conclude, on the one hand, that specific SOR allegations\n(i.e., Applicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign relatives) create security concerns (i.e. disqualifying\nconditions apply to those circumstances) and, on the other hand, conclude those allegations or\nforeign contacts do not raise security concerns.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02149 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Mar.\n5, 2019) for a discussion of a similar contradiction in a Judge\u2019s Guideline B analysis.  If the Judge \nmeant to say the frequency of Applicant\u2019s contact with his foreign relatives mitigates the pertinent\nsecurity concerns, then we do not agree with that conclusion.  The Judge found that Applicant\nmaintains weekly contact with his mother and monthly contact with his siblings.  Those contacts are\nnot so casual or infrequent to mitigate the resulting security concerns.  Furthermore, infrequency of\ncontact is not necessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or\nobligation to, his or her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate family. \nCompare, ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019).\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in concluding that, with the\nexception of Applicant\u2019s sibling who works for the Egyptian government, none of his other relatives\nhave ties to that country\u2019s government.  Department Counsel correctly points out that Applicant\u2019s\nmother and one of his sibling-in-law are retired government employees and his other sibling-in-law\nstill works for the government.  Department Counsel further contends that the Judge\nmischaracterized the nature of the employment of Applicant\u2019s sibling with the Egyptian government. \nAppeal Brief at 3.  In his security clearance application, Applicant stated this sibling was a\n[Redacted].  Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 40.  In responding to the SOR, he also admitted without\n4\n\nqualification that this sibling was a [Redacted].  In the findings of fact, the Judge stated,\n\u201cApplicant\u2019s [sibling in question] has an administrative position with the Egyptian [Redacted].  It\nis not a political appointment but is a civil service position.\u201d  [Decision at 4.]  This finding is\napparently based on Applicant\u2019s testimony that this sibling \u201cdoes some administrative work . . . I\ndon\u2019t know exactly the details of what [the sibling] does, but I know [the sibling] is in the\n[Redacted].\u201d  Tr. at 26 and 64-65.  Department Counsel argues this apparent contradiction in the\nsibling\u2019s employment responsibilities has a significant impact in terms of assessing the security risk\nthat this sibling presents.  We note (and  the Judge found) that Applicant admitted the SOR\nallegation asserting the sibling in question is a [Redacted], which is sufficient to establish by\nsubstantial evidence the sibling holds that status.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd.\nApr. 20, 2018).     \nDepartment Counsel argues that \u201cthe biggest and more relevant concern arises from\nApplicant\u2019s [sibling\u2019s] employment as a [Redacted] with the Egyptian [government].\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 15.  We agree.  Applicant\u2019s employment involves [Redacted] for the United States.  The nature\nof Applicant\u2019s and his sibling\u2019s employment creates a potential conflict of interest that, on its face,\nis significant.  In this regard, it also merits noting that the Judge made apparent inconsistent\nstatements regarding the extent of the knowledge this sibling has about Applicant\u2019s employment. \nAt one point, the Judge indicated that Applicant\u2019s siblings \u201cknew at some point Applicant was\nworking on [Redacted].\u201d  Decision at 4.  Later, the Judge contradicted that statement by saying,\n\u201cNor do any of these relatives (including the [sibling] working for the [Egyptian government]) know\n. . . the details about what [Applicant\u2019s] job entails.\u201d  Decision at 10.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not\ndirectly or adequately analyze the apparent conflict of interest arising from the nature of Applicant\u2019s\nand his sibling\u2019s employment. \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s sibling as a [Redacted] of the Egyptian government also gives rise\nto security concerns.  In the past, we have recognized that an applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or\nthrough a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign government or military are of\nparticular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such persons the\napplicant could come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother was a\nhigh-level foreign government official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,\n2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a retired high-ranking official in a foreign army);\nand ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) (Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee\nof a high-ranking foreign government official).  Given the facts in this case, it is foreseeable that the\nhigh-level governmental position of Applicant\u2019s sibling could become a means through which parties\ncould attempt to exert pressure on him.  The Judge\u2019s decision fails to analyze the security\nsignificance arising from the sibling\u2019s high-level governmental position.   \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen about three years before the hearing.  He has not filed\npaperwork to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. Tr. at 53-54; GE 1.   His wife, and his children are\ndual citizens, each retaining their Egyptian citizenship.  Tr. at 56 and 58-59; GE 1 and 2.  Applicant\u2019s\nties to Egypt are significant.  The record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that, given the\n5\n\nspecific security concerns present in this case, that Applicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\nwould necessarily outweigh his sense of loyalty or obligation to his relatives in Egypt.  Application\nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that\npeople may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-\none, such as a family member.  As stated above, any doubt concerning security clearance eligibility\nmust be resolved in favor of the national security. \n      \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and\ncapricious because it fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and runs contrary to the weight of the record\nevidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient\nto mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard.  The decision is not\nsustainable.  \nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMark A. Myers, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 18, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 21, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed properly\nto apply the Guideline B disqualifying conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under\nGuideline B was unsupported by the greater weight of the record evidence and, therefore, was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Department Counsel raised no issues regarding the concern\nalleged under Guideline C.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born in Iraq, came to the U.S. in the mid-2000s, and became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in about 2013.  Applicant has worked for Defense contractors since 2003, except for several\nmonths between 2014 and 2016.  Divorced, she has a child.  Though currently employed by a\nDefense contractor, Applicant has enlisted in the U.S. military.\nApplicant has close family members who are citizens and residents of Iraq\u2013her mother and\nseveral siblings.  Applicant claimed that she broke off contact with her Iraqi family in late 2017, after\nshe received the SOR.  She also testified that she broke off contact with her mother because she was\nupset over having not been informed about her father\u2019s death.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s siblings also worked with U.S. forces in Iraq.  Two SOR allegations were\nbased upon a report by a U.S. military service intelligence command, stating that these two siblings\nhad cooperated with forces opposed to the U.S. and its allies.  Applicant testified that she was not\naware of these allegations and hoped that they were not true.  \nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq.  She has checking and savings accounts in the\nU.S. and has expressed a willingness to renounce any dual citizenship that she has with any foreign\ncountry.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of her duty performance, and her\nsupervisors describe her as loyal, honest, and trustworthy.  She is described as exceeding\nexpectations in the accomplishment of her duties.\nNumerous terrorist groups operate within Iraq, although Iraqi forces have enjoyed success\nrecently in retaking territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \nNevertheless, there is a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.  Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may threaten\nU.S. citizens in Iraq, and the U.S. requires Government personnel to live and work under strict\nsecurity guidelines.  ISIS has committed numerous human rights abuses, and sectarian hostility has\n2\n\nweakened the Iraqi government\u2019s authority.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge found that Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) and (b)1 apply to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances.  In concluding that Applicant had succeeded in mitigating these concerns, the Judge\ncited to Applicant\u2019s limited contact with her family during deployments, her evidence that she ceased\nall communications with her family after having received the SOR, that she has no financial interests\nin Iraq, and that her Iraqi family members do not know what she does for a living or where she lives. \nHe found credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that she did not know about her siblings\u2019 cooperation with\nforces opposed to U.S. interests, noting that the intelligence finding is more than ten years old.  The\nJudge also relied upon Applicant\u2019s character references and her long history of support for U.S.\npolicy objectives.  The Judge further cited to Applicant\u2019s years of support of the U.S. and her stated\nintent to renounce any dual citizenship that she holds.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, its human rights\nrecord, and the presence of terrorist activity are important considerations that provide context for the\nother record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \n1Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b): \u201ccontact . . . with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\u201d and \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology[.]\u201d\n3\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019).  Even a person of the highest\ncharacter can experience circumstances under which he or she could be tempted to place the well-\nbeing of foreign relatives over the interests of the U.S.  Id. at 5.   \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge failed properly to apply the disqualifying\nconditions.  She argues that the Judge should have applied Disqualifying Condition 7(d)\n(\u201ccounterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that indicates the individual\u2019s\naccess to classified information . . . may involve unacceptable risk to national security.\u201d)2   \nWe find this argument to be persuasive.  Judges have wide latitude in how they write\ndecisions, and they are not expected to discuss every piece of record evidence or each of the various\ndisqualifying or mitigating conditions.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30,\n2018); ISCR Case No. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  However, a Judge should apply the\nadjudicative criteria that are fairly raised by the record evidence.  In this case, the record contains a\ndeclassified document prepared by intelligence officials working for a military department.  This\nexhibit shows that Applicant\u2019s siblings, who were working with U.S. forces in Iraq, were found to\nhave been actively cooperating with persons in Iraq who were hostile to U.S. interests.  Moreover,\nthe evidence shows that Applicant maintained regular contact with these siblings until the end of\n2017, when she received the SOR.  Taken together, this intelligence report and evidence of her\ncontact with her siblings are sufficient to raise a concern that Applicant\u2019s siblings could be a means\nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those interested in obtaining access to U.S.\nclassified information, thereby entailing an unacceptable risk to national security.  We conclude that\nthe evidence discussed above satisfies the criteria of Disqualifying Condition 7(d) and that the Judge\nerred by not evaluating Applicant\u2019s circumstances and her case for mitigation in light of it.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider significant record\nevidence and runs counter to any reasonable interpretation of the evidence.  We find this argument\nto be persuasive.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  However, the Judge cannot ignore,\ndisregard, or fail to discuss record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into\naccount in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 9, 2017).\nWe note the following, drawn from the record and from the Judge\u2019s findings:\nApplicant began working for Defense contractor overseas in 2003.  At least one of her\nsiblings also began working with the U.S. military in that year.  Decision at 2; Applicant Exhibit\n(AE) I.\nIn about 2005, Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq received a letter stating that \u201cthey knew that we are\nworking and supporting the [U.S.] military and if we don\u2019t quit our job that they will burn our house\n2Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(d).\n4\n\nand kill the rest of my family.\u201d  AE I.\nAt least by the mid-2000s, two of Applicant\u2019s siblings were working in support of U.S.\nobjectives in Iraq.  An intelligence investigation uncovered information that these two siblings were\nin fact cooperating with forces opposed to the U.S. and other coalition members.  Government\nExhibit (GE)  4, Summary of Information, dated May 7, 2009.\nThis investigation concluded that one of the siblings had a relationship with an opposing\nmilitia leader and provided information about an upcoming military operation.  This resulted in the\n\u201ckilling of innocent people.\u201d  GE 4.\nThis sibling also threatened other contractor personnel with \u201cretribution\u201d by militia forces\nwhen they disagreed with the sibling.  GE 4.\nThe two siblings \u201cmaintained extensive contacts with numerous anti-Coalition and other\nnefarious personnel, to include Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) financiers, IED [improvised explosive\ndevices] manufacturers, kidnappers, drug smugglers, weapons dealers, . . .  and individuals wanted\nby intelligence organizations of other countries.\u201d  GE 4.\nOne of the siblings received a text message from a contact saved within her phone\u2019s address\nbook.  This message identified a named person as \u201ca spy for the Americans.\u201d  GE 4.  \nOne sibling\u2019s activity included the possession in living quarters of prohibited\ncommunications devices, such as a laptop computer, cell phone, and IPOD.  GE 4.\nWhen queried, the siblings denied any improper activity. Intelligence officials found their\ndenials to be contradicted by their own statements and by other evidence.  GE 4.\nThe intelligence investigation concluded that Applicant\u2019s two siblings were \u201cserious force\nprotection and security risks to the U.S. or Coalition personnel and installations.\u201d  GE 4.\n  Applicant performs her official duties in Iraq, spending most of her time in that country. \nIn 2016 and 2017 she spent 11 months there.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 40-41.  \nApplicant made inconsistent statements about how frequently she contacted her mother\nbefore receipt of the SOR.  In her 2016 Security Clearance Application (SCA), she stated that she\nspoke with her mother every day.  However, at the hearing, she testified that it had been much less,\nabout every three months.  SCA at 32; Tr. at 28.  She also made inconsistent statements about the\nreasons that her siblings left their employment.  In AE I, she stated that they quit the job because of\njealousy from co-workers.  However, at the hearing, she testified that the siblings were laid off.  Tr.\nat 63-64.  \nForces hostile to U.S. interests operate within Iraq.  These include sectarian militias and ISIS. \nISIS has committed numerous human rights abuses, including violence on a mass scale.  These\n5\n\nforces pose a clear danger to U.S. citizens in Iraq.  Decision at 5-6.  \nAs Department Counsel notes, there are significant omissions from the Judge\u2019s findings and\nanalysis.  For example, the Judge made no findings at all about the threatening letter that Applicant\u2019s\nfamily received as she was working in support of the U.S. military.  Clearly, an applicant who has\nalready been identified and threatened, possibly by a terrorist organization, is someone who may well \nencounter such threats in the future and thereby be pressured to compromise national security\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02862 at 4 (App. Bd. May 22, 2018).  This evidence,\nwhich is contained in one of Applicant\u2019s own exhibits, is something that a reasonable person would\nlikely expect the Judge to have addressed explicitly in the context of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation,\nand his failure to have done so undermines his favorable analysis.\nAdditionally, the Judge made no findings about the substance of GE 4, with its many detailed\nfactual conclusions drawn from the intelligence investigation of Applicant\u2019s siblings.  In fact, his\ntreatment of this matter consisted of finding credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that she was not aware\nof her siblings\u2019 conduct and that these activities occurred over ten years ago.  However, as\nDepartment Counsel argues, the security concern in this case arises not from Applicant\u2019s knowledge\nof her siblings\u2019 misconduct.  Rather, it arises from evidence that two close relatives, with whom\nApplicant spoke frequently apparently up until the end of 2017, provided protected information to\nforces opposed to the U.S., threatened other contract employees, possessed unauthorized electronic\ncommunication media in their private quarters, and gave deceptive answers about these matters when\nquestioned by intelligence personnel.  Applicant\u2019s frequent contact with her siblings over a course\nof years suggests that her relationship with them could be a means through which she comes to the\nattention of hostile persons, including those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information, even\nas she came to the attention of persons of this sort in the past.  Indeed, Applicant\u2019s siblings are\nthemselves parties who have been found hostile to the U.S. and with whom Applicant has an\nongoing familial relationship.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination is impaired\nby Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2017).  The Judge\u2019s analysis, therefore, fails to address in a meaningful way record evidence that\nentails significant security concerns and is sufficient to raise serious doubts about her susceptibility\nto pressure, coercion, or duress.  Even without reference to the Judge\u2019s failure to have applied\nDisqualifying Condition 7(d), this evidence suggests a real possibility that Applicant could be\npressured to choose foreign interests over those of the U.S. or experience a conflict of interest.  \nIn summary, Applicant has worked in Iraq for many years in support of U.S. objectives.  In\nthe mid-2000s, her family was threatened with death unless Applicant and her siblings quit their\njobs.  Two of Applicant\u2019s siblings engaged in numerous actions harmful to U.S. interests, whether\nin response to this letter or not.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with them, even if broken off after receipt\nof the SOR, suggests that she could come to the attention of persons hostile to the U.S., as she\nalready did in the recent past.  Most significantly, she has an immediate family relationship with two\npersons who have engaged in actions hostile to U.S. interests.  As noted above, the Judge failed to\nevaluate Applicant\u2019s case in light of Disqualifying Condition 7(d).  However, even under the\nDisqualifying Conditions that he did examine, Applicant\u2019s evidence that she was unaware of her\nsiblings\u2019 clandestine activities; that she hopes the investigative findings about them are not true; that\n6\n\nshe no longer speaks with them; and her excellent duty performance are not enough to mitigate a\nconcern that, once again, Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. could become known to hostile parties and\nthat she or her family could be subjected to threats in an effort to obtain U.S. classified or protected\ninformation.    \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision fails to consider important aspects of the\ncase and runs contrary to the record evidence.  After considering the record as a whole, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.        \nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant eligibility for Common\nAccess Card (CAC) credentialing.  On November 9, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013Criminal, Dishonest Conduct, or Financial\nIrresponsibility concerns and Material, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud concerns,\nraised under the adjudicative standards in the appendices of DoD Instruction 5200.46 (Sep. 9, 2014)\n(Instruction).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 15, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert J. Kilmartin denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for CAC eligibility.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Instruction, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 6.\nOn September 19, 2018, we remanded the case to the Judge to correct an identified error. \nOn October 11, 2018, the Judge issued a Remand Decision in which he again denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a CAC.  Applicant appealed pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6.  \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that she\nhad deliberately omitted information from a Declaration for Federal Employment and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 40-year-old severely disabled employee of a Federal contractor.  She has been\nworking for her current employer at a military installation since late 2016.  The SOR alleges several\nminor offenses or infractions, including that Applicant was charged with reckless driving in 2013;\narrested for theft by deception - passing two bad checks in 2012; arrested for giving a false name\nto a police officer and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in 2011; and arrested for\ncruelty to animals in 2010.  She admitted the reckless driving allegation, was found guilty of the bad\ncheck offenses, and was sentenced to serve 20 days in jail for the false name and drug offenses.  The\nJudge found portions of her testimony to be not credible.  She has not been arrested since 2013.  Her\ncharacter references attest to her hard work and kindness.  \nIn completing a Declaration for Federal Employment (Form 306) in 2016, Applicant\nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to the question that asked if she had been convicted, imprisoned, on probation, or\non parole in the last seven years.  She only disclosed the 2012 check offenses and 2011 arrest for\nproviding false information to a policeman.  She denied that she had deliberately omitted the other\noffenses from her form.  She attributed her omissions to forgetfulness.  The Judge found that\nApplicant had failed to list the only offense for which Applicant went to jail.   \nWith the exception of two minor charges,1 the Judge found that Applicant had not mitigated\nthe criminal and dishonest conduct concerns.  She omitted information about the most serious\noffenses from her Form 306.  The Judge did not find her explanation for the omissions to be\nforthright or candid.  She did not mitigate the material, intentional, false statement, deception, or\nfraud concerns.  In the whole-person analysis, the Judge stated that Applicant had overcome\n1 The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two harassing communication charges from 2008.  \n2\n\n\u201ctremendous physical challenges and disadvantages.\u201d  Decision at 8.  However, he concluded that\nher pattern of law violations undermined her trustworthiness; that she did not provide a meaningful\nexplanation for her omissions; and that she did not provide restitution for her bad check offenses.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief cites to new evidence, which we cannot consider.  See, e.g., CAC Case\nNo.15-06228 at 1 (App. Bd. Dec. 22, 2016).  Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she\ndeliberately omitted material information from her Form 306.  However, the Judge\u2019s finding is a\nreasonable inference from the evidence.  The Judge\u2019s material findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.  See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-03527 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2018).  Applicant requests that\nwe consult a web site that she claims would provide medical substantiation for her memory loss.2 \nWe have no authority to investigate a case, insofar as we have no fact-finding power.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-02394 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015).\nApplicant notes that the Judge cited to a provision of the Instruction that lists an individual\u2019s\nage and maturity as relevant factors in CAC adjudications.  See Instruction, Encl. 4 \u00b6 1(b)(4).  She\nargues that she developed late and was not mature at the time of her misconduct.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.   See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-01524 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s conclusion that granting Applicant CAC eligibility poses an unacceptable risk\nis sustainable on this record.\n2Applicant argues she is subject to difficulties with concentration, memory, and decision-making.  Even if the\nrecord demonstrated these difficulties, it is not clear that the result would be mitigating.  Holders of CAC eligibility may\nnot create an unacceptable risk to people or property.  Applicant\u2019s purported difficulties could diminish that\nresponsibility.\n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.   \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.  \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 6, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On February 7, 2019, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline J are not\nat issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to the issue raised on appeal: from\n2007 to 2016, Applicant acquired seven delinquent debts, totaling over $14,000.  These were for\nmedical expenses and a consumer account.  Applicant attributed the medical debts to his wife\u2019s\nillness while he was deployed overseas.  His wife passed away, and he does not know if she ever\nsubmitted claims to the couple\u2019s medical insurer.  Applicant made no follow-up regarding the extent\nto which these debts were covered by insurance.  Applicant purchased a home with the proceeds\nfrom his wife\u2019s life insurance policy, applying none of them toward resolving his debts.  He\nprovided no evidence that he had lodged disputes of these debts, nor did he present evidence of\nefforts to contact his creditors or the credit repair firm that he had hired.  He provided no \u201chelpful\ndocumentation\u201d of steps to resolve his SOR debts.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for\ncharacter, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Decision at 4.\nThough noting Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s death, the Judge concluded that he had not demonstrated\nresponsible action in regard to the debts listed in the SOR.  He also concluded that Applicant had\nnot shown that he initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to pay his debts.  Although his debts\nare not longer listed on his credit report, this does not demonstrate that they have actually been\nresolved in such as way a to mitigate the concerns arising from them.  All in all, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of debt resolution.\nDiscussion\nApplicant cites to record evidence that he contends that the Judge did not consider or that\nhe did not properly weigh.  This includes the circumstances under which his debts arose, his having\nhired a firm to address his debts, his contention that the medical debts should be paid by his insurer,\netc.  The Judge made findings about these things.  Applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony\nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he had not met his burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the\nJudge considered all of the evidence in the record.  Neither has he shown that the Judge weighed the\n2\n\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).\nWe give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited in support of\nhis effort to obtain a favorable decision.  However, Hearing Office cases are not binding on other\nHearing Office Judges or on the Appeal Board.  Each case must be decided on its own merits.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2018). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 31, 2018, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent debts exceeding $199,000, failed to file\nhis 2013-2015 Federal income tax returns as required, and failed to pay his 2013-2014 Federal\nincome taxes as required.  The Judge found against Applicant on each SOR allegation, noting he\nprovided no documentation that he filed the tax returns in question, paid the past-due taxes, or\nresolved a delinquent mortgage loan.  The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s military career and his status as\na graduate of a distinguished military academy.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that he was not provided due process because of the\nlength of time it has taken to process his case.  He notes his case has taken three and a half years to\nresolve.  His argument fails to establish that he was denied any due process rights under the\nDirective.  He was provided adequate notice of, and opportunity to respond to, the alleged security\nconcerns.   The Appeal Board has no authority to rule on delays in conducting security\ninvestigations or in processing cases.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04186 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

This\nargument has no merit. The Judge properly advised Applicant of his rights to have a lawyer or\npersonal representative assist him at the hearing, and Applicant acknowledged  he understood those\nrights.  Tr. at 7.  He knowingly waived his right to legal representation. \nApplicant\u2019s brief asserts that he has now filed his delinquent tax returns, has placed his\nprimary residence for sale, and will use the proceeds of that sale to resolve his debts.  These\nassertions constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant cites to a case of a public person that was in the news.  The Board lacks\njurisdiction to review the merits of a case committed to another Government body.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 15-04953 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2017).  Furthermore, each case must be adjudicated on\nits own merits.

He emphasizes, for example,  his service in the military and as a defense contractor,\nhis lack of security violations, and the impact of the Great Recession on his financial situation.  He\nargues that he is not a threat to national security.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT.\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July \n28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 10, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He was granted a security\nclearance in 2006.  He was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in 1992 and for possession\nof marijuana in 1995.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on those two drug-related arrests.\nIn early 2017, Applicant smoked marijuana at a party that he attended without his wife.  Later\nthat month, he tested positive for marijuana during a random drug screening, and his employer\nsuspended him without pay.  He did not report his marijuana use before the drug test.  His employer\nallowed him to continue his employment contingent on him successfully completing a substance\nabuse program.  Shortly after completing the substance abuse program, he passed a drug test and\nreturned to work under a last-chance agreement.   \nApplicant attributed his latest drug incident to a lapse in judgment.  He indicated that he has\nno intention of using illegal drugs in the future.  He submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain\nfrom drug involvement, acknowledging that future use would be grounds to revoke his national\nsecurity eligibility.  \nAlthough Applicant presented a \u201cgood case in reform and rehabilitation,\u201d the Judge\nconcluded that he was not an acceptable security risk.  The Judge noted that Applicant used\nmarijuana as a security clearance holder who was subject to random drug tests, that such use\ndemonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk behavior, and that such use most likely would not\nhave come to light absent the random drug test.  \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] reluctance to voluntarily self-report\nsuch adverse information further undermines his suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Decision at 6. \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Rather\nhe challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding his security clearance suitability.  For example, he\nargues \u201c[t]he judge came to his conclusion based on a subjective opinion of my future character and\nintegrity that is contrary to my thirteen year career holding a clearance.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  In\n2\n\nsupport of his arguments, he highlights, among other matters, the duration of time that has passed\nsince his last marijuana use, his good record for protecting classified information, his honesty and\nopenness during the investigative process, and the Judge\u2019s comments that he understands the\nseriousness of the latest incident and presented a good case of reform and rehabilitation.  We do not\nfind Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.  First, even in the absence of any security violations, the\nGovernment can deny or revoke access to classified information based on the existence of facts and\ncircumstances that indicate an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 99-0462 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000).  Second, the conclusions of DOHA Judges are\noften subjective in nature.  As we have noted in the past, security clearance decisions are not an exact\nscience but rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that\nperson's past conduct and present circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11489 at 4 (App. Bd.\nSep. 11, 2003), citing Department of Navy v. Egan , 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  From our review\nof the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern in this case are\nbased on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  Third, Applicant\u2019s\narguments essentially amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  The\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 16-00276 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2017).  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The record\nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In June 2013, he traveled to Taiwan to visit her, and he\nsubmitted a travel request that his employer required for foreign travel.  In this request, Applicant\nfalsely stated that he was going to Taiwan with his wife, and he also failed to receive a required\ntravel briefing.  Applicant remained away from his job longer than his scheduled period of approved\nleave, advising his employer that he had missed his return flight.  In fact, he intentionally missed the\nflight so that he could remain in Taiwan longer with the woman with whom he was conducting an\naffair.  As a result, Applicant was AWOL from his employment for about five days.  \nWhen questioned by a Government official about his relationship with the Taiwanese\nwoman, Applicant stated that he would not be seeing her again.  After that, however, the woman\ncame to visit Applicant in the U.S. for about six weeks.  He failed to report this visit to the\nappropriate security authorities at his place of employment.  \nWhen completing his security clearance application (SCA) in 2016, Applicant did not\ndisclose a judgment against him, delinquent student loans in significant amounts, and accounts that\nhad been placed in collection status.  His \u201cno\u201d answers to the questions at issue were false. \nA co-worker found Applicant to be reliable and trustworthy.  His job performance\nevaluations generally rate him as \u201cconsistently meets standards.\u201d  A friend commended Applicant\u2019s\nhonesty, loyalty, and integrity.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThough noting that Applicant\u2019s military AWOL occurred several years in the past, the Judge\nstated that his poor decision-making persisted in the intervening years.  She also found Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility to be questionable.  The Judge noted, for example, that he was not truthful concerning his\naffair with the Taiwanese women and that he deliberately lied to his employer on more than one\noccasion.  She also stated that he deliberately failed to disclose his debts, citing to the extent of his\ndelinquent student loans as a reason to believe that Applicant was aware of them at the time he\ncompleted his SCA.  \u201cThe fact that he did not list these loans in response to questions on his\napplication, shows that he was either extremely careless, or he deliberately concealed the information\nfrom the Government, which in either case indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nuntrustworthiness[.]\u201d Decision at 7.\nIn the whole-person analysis, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s having held a clearance for several\nyears.  She stated, however, that he was neither young nor naive, reiterating her findings that he lied\non his SCA about his debts and that he lied to his employer in order to conceal material information\nabout his extramarital affair.  \u201cThis is not an individual . . .  whom the Government can be confident\n. . .  will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking.\u201d \nDecision at 9.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting evidence of his AWOL while in the\nmilitary and of the resulting court-martial.  These things were considered during an earlier clearance\ninvestigation, and he believes that the doctrine of res judicata prevents them from being addressed\nduring his current one.  We do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments to be persuasive.  While res judicata\nhas some applicability in DOHA cases, the Government is never estopped from considering matters\nfrom a prior adjudication, especially when, as in the case before us, there is subsequent misconduct. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007).  In this case, Applicant went\nAWOL from his job in 2013 and made numerous false statements to his employers about his\ncircumstances.  That he did so despite having received a punitive discharge for a six-year incident\nof AWOL several years earlier was a matter that the Judge was entitled to consider in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation and rehabilitation.  The Judge did not err by admitting and\nconsidering evidence of Applicant\u2019s earlier misconduct.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that he had made deliberate false statements\nto his employer as well as on his SCA.  He contends that, at worst, he was negligent in failing to\nnotify his employer about his travel plans and that he relied on his wife to pay bills and, therefore,\ndid not know about the extent of his debts.  However, Government Exhibit 3, a U.S. Government\nMemorandum, dated October 1, 2014, contained a transcription of Applicant\u2019s interview with a\nGovernment agent from September 26, 2013, in which he admitted that he was not truthful during\na security interview concerning his 2013 travel to Taiwan.  In addition, Applicant acknowledged on\ncross examination that he told his employer \u201clies\u201d and was deceitful about his travel to Taiwan and\nabout his relationship with the Taiwanese woman.  Tr. at 137-140.  \n3\n\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s omissions from his SCA, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate\nfalsification is supported by evidence that Applicant was aware of his financial problems at the time\nhe completed his SCA, as well as by the multiple nature of his false statements, which in and of itself\ncan give rise to a conclusion of deliberate misconduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08163 at 5 (App.\nBd. Oct. 25, 2017).  We note the Judge\u2019s comment that if Applicant did not lie on his SCA he was\nat least extremely negligent, which might appear to qualify her conclusion about his mens rea.  In\nthe first place, the Directive provides that \u201cany failure . . . to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring national security investigative . . . processes\u201d can raise questions about a person\u2019s eligibility\nfor a clearance.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A\u00b6 15 (emphasis added).  It does not expressly limit the\nconcern to deliberately false statements only.  In  the second place, viewing the decision as a whole,\nwe conclude that the Judge treated the SCA omissions as deliberate failures to disclose material\ninformation, as, for example in her whole-person analysis.  The Judge\u2019s various findings about\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications and omissions are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the\nsame record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See also ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30,\n2019).\nApplicant cites to his favorable evidence and argues that the Judge erred in evaluating his\ncase for mitigation.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  A\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the record is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02250 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMay 23, 2019). \nApplicant asks if he can be given the \u201cbenefit of the doubt.\u201d (Appeal brief at 3). We are\ninstructed as follows: \u201cany doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.\u2019  Directive, Encl.\n2 \u00b6 E.4.\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On October 22, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Insufficient evidence was provided to establish that\nhis unpaid Federal and state taxes for 2016 and 2017 are being resolved.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant did not provide a legitimate explanation for his tax filing deficiencies.  His failure\nto file Federal income tax returns in a timely manner for six years casts doubt on his current\njudgment and reliability.  Although he is making bankruptcy payments to address unpaid taxes, no\nevidence has been presented that he is resolving or paying his unpaid Federal and state taxes for\n2016 and 2017.      \n   \n \nDiscussion\n \n2\n\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence,  mis-weighed\nthe evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.

We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant\nhas cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the\nJudge\u2019s decision.  Id.  Additionally, the Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in\nher whole-persons analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax\nreturns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and\nreliability required of those granted access to classified information.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 6, 2018,, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against\nApplicant; whether the Judge utilized an improper standard in making his findings of fact; whether\nthe Judge abused his discretion in amending the SOR; whether the Judge denied Applicant due\nprocess; whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is the president of a Defense contractor.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and is an\nordained minister.  Applicant has held a secret clearance since 2005.  He also has held a top secret\nclearance with access to sensitive compartmented information in the past.  He is married and has\nfour adopted children.\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges that he failed to pay his Federal taxes for 2010 through 2013 and\nfor 2015; that he failed to pay his state taxes for 2010 through 2015; and that he is indebted to the\nFederal Government for six tax liens secured against him in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.  The total\namount of the alleged liens is nearly $204,000.  Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and\nthe Judge incorporated these admissions into his findings.1  \nApplicant attributed his tax delinquencies to several factors: his company has struggled\nthrough the years; his wife has experienced serious health problems; Appellant\u2019s wife lost income\nas a realtor during the poor housing market; he lost rental income on property that he owned; he\nreceived poor tax advice from his accountants; and the adoption of his children took two years\nlonger than anticipated.  His loss of income, failure to pay payroll taxes in a timely manner, and\nfailure to maintain monthly payments under installment agreements eventually led the IRS to cancel\nthose agreements and file liens.\nAlthough Applicant failed to pay his tax obligations as due, he filed his Federal returns in\na timely fashion, except for tax year 2016.  He eventually filed his 2016 return several days after the\nhearing.  The IRS initially rejected this return due to errors but finally accepted it in August 2018.\n1During the hearing, the Judge amended the SOR to include an allegation that Applicant failed to file his 2016\nincome tax returns in a timely manner.  Tr. at 81-83.  Applicant neither admitted nor denied this additional allegation. \nSee below for discussion of Applicant\u2019s assignment of error on this matter.\n2\n\nFor all of the years in question, except for 2014, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was about\n$200,000 or more.  His AGI for 2014 was about $85,500.  As stated above, Applicant had an\ninstallment agreement with the IRS, who cancelled it after Applicant failed to make a required\npayment.  Applicant presented some documentary evidence in corroboration of his claim to have\nmade payments over $44,000 under this agreement.\nApplicant made an offer in compromise to the IRS, but the agency rejected it.  Applicant\nclaimed that he had made $16,000 in payments during that time, but he only corroborated about\n$14,500.  Applicant entered into another payment plan covering 2010 through 2013.  He made only\ntwo payments under the plan because a client stopped paying him.  During this time, Applicant\u2019s\nbalance due to the IRS for 2010 through 2013 increased to nearly $118,000.  Applicant stated that\nas of August 2018 his unpaid individual income taxes totaled nearly $154,000 for 2010 through\n2013 and 2015.  However, at the hearing he testified that his 2010 through 2013 taxes had been paid\nand that only his debts for 2014 and 2015 remained due, both of which were covered under an\ninstallment agreement.  \nRegarding the liens entered against him, Applicant told his clearance interviewer that he had\nnot been aware of any liens at the time he completed his security clearance application (SCA). \nHowever, this contention is not consistent with the contents of his installment agreements, which\nshow that liens had already been filed.  These agreements predate the SCA.  Applicant contended\nthat he had disputed some of his liens with the IRS but did not corroborate that claim.  Applicant\nalso failed to corroborate his claim to have resolved his state tax obligation.  He  did present\nevidence of an installment agreement, dated January 2018, showing a balance owed of nearly\n$17,000.  He did present evidence of six payments under this agreement.\nApplicant also has other delinquent debts, such as a mortgage, credit card, automobile loan,\nand medical expenses.  Has paid off most of the $38,480 that these debts amount to.  In addition, he\nowns a residence where his mother lives and pays about $600 a month toward the mortgage.  His\nfinancial statement shows that he has a net monthly income of about $15,500, with about $800 left\nafter ordinary expenses.  There is no evidence that he has received financial counseling.  He failed\nto provide corroboration for his testimony about the various causes underlying his financial\nproblems.  However, as noted above, Applicant\u2019s gross income has almost consistently exceeded\n$200,000.  He found that his claims about his wife\u2019s loss of income is unsupported by documentary\ncorroboration, as is his testimony about lost rental income and poor advice from accountants.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his duty performance, knowledge, and\nexperience.  He recently received an award for his \u201cconsistent record of excellence.\u201d  Decision at\n8.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax problems raised the following concerns: inability \nto satisfy debts, unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; a history of not meeting\n3\n\nfinancial obligations; and failure to file and pay taxes when due.2  He further concluded that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  He noted that Applicant\u2019s unpaid\ndebts are ongoing and, therefore, recent.  He also reiterated his finding that Applicant had not\ncorroborated his testimony about the causes of his problems or his efforts to resolve them.  The\nJudge stated that, as president of a corporation, Applicant was charged with understanding the\nvarious financial requirements that went with the position.  Applicant had a significant income for\nthe years in question, and yet his difficulties are still unresolved.  The Judge cited to his finding that\nApplicant had not received financial guidance, and he also concluded that Applicant\u2019s payment\nhistory does not equate to a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  He also stated that inability to pay\ntaxes is not an excuse for having failed to file his 2016 return on time.  He concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s recent efforts at addressing his tax problems suggest that he has done so simply because\nhis clearance is in jeopardy and that Applicant\u2019s evidence, viewed as a whole, amounts to a promise\nto resolve his debts in the future, which is not enough to establish mitigation.\nIn the whole-person analysis the Judge stated that Applicant had established \u201can extremely\npoor track record of debt reduction . . .  until well after the SOR was issued.\u201d   \u201cOverall, the\nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a security clearance.\u201d  Id. at 15.\nDiscussion\nBias\nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him.  He cites to various aspects of the\nrecord which be believes demonstrate that the Judge was not impartial.  A Judge is presumed to be\nunbiased and a party who alleges otherwise has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018).  Bias involves partiality for or against a\nparty, predisposition to decide a case or issue without regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack\nof impartiality.  ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2017).    \nAmong the things that Applicant asserts in support of this assignment of error is the claim\nthat the Judge directed him to present evidence from which the Judge later drew unfavorable\nconclusions.  Applicant is referring to a portion of the hearing in which Department Counsel\nquestioned him about his yearly income.  Applicant did not provide a clear answer, and his counsel\nexpressed a concern that Applicant was being required to \u201cdo math in his head on the stand.\u201d  Tr.\nat 79.  At this point, the Judge interjected, proposing that the issue could be resolved if he could have\nthe first two pages of every income tax return for the years in question.  He advised that he did not\nneed \u201cthe rest of the stuff,\u201d meaning the entire tax documents, only those that would address the\nmatter of Applicant\u2019s income.  Id.  In the end the Judge concluded that this evidence showed that\nApplicant had sufficient income to have resolved his financial problems.  \n2Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18 (a-c, f).\n4\n\nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, on this record we construe the Judge\u2019s motive\nin seeking the tax returns to have been an effort to clarify the evidence on a material point rather\nthan to hobble Applicant in his effort to establish mitigation or otherwise to place an undue burden\nupon him.3  We have examined the other things that Applicant has cited as evidence of bias and\nconclude that they constitute rulings, interpretations of the record, findings, etc., with which\nApplicant is dissatisfied.  A party cannot demonstrate bias merely by showing that the Judge ruled\nagainst him or her.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017);  See also\nBixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751 at 762 (10th Cir. 2010).  Applicant has directed our attention to\nnothing that would likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite\nimpartiality.\n \nImproper Standard for Making Findings\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not utilize the proper standard in making findings and\ndrawing conclusions therefrom.  Noting the Judge\u2019s comments that he had not corroborated his\ntestimony about the difficult circumstances underlying his financial problems or about his effort at\nrepayment, Appellant argues that the Judge, in effect, wrongfully denied to his testimony the status\nof evidence.  We construe this argument to mean that the Judge did not comply with the criteria set\nforth in the Directive for making and evaluating findings of fact.  \nThe standard that we use in evaluating the sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s findings is set forth in\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1:   \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  See ISCR Case No.\n17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  Of course, testimony is evidence and, in an appropriate\ncase, it can support sustainable findings on its own.  However, it is not unreasonable for a Judge to\nexpect an applicant to corroborate his claims that he has mitigated the concerns set forth in an SOR. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  In a DOHA proceeding, the\napplicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have access to classified information,\nand corroborating evidence can go a long way toward enabling an applicant to meet that burden. \nIn the case before us, the Judge did in fact make findings drawn from Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nHowever, he apparently did not find Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions to be sufficiently\ncredible so as to satisfy the mitigating conditions set forth in the Directive, and we are required to\ngive deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Moreover, a Judge\nis not required to give conclusive weight to any kind of evidence, even if it is un-rebutted.4  The\nJudge did not contravene the Directive in making his findings of fact. \n3By stating or implying that a party should not present certain evidence, the Judge runs the risk of infringing\non a party\u2019s responsibility to present evidence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E.3.1.14. and E.3.1.15.\n4See ISCR Case No. 98-0592 at 5 (App. Bd. May 4, 1999): A \u201cJudge must consider the record as a whole and\nuse common sense . . . in evaluating the absence of corroborating evidence.\u201d  This case quotes ISCR Case No. 98-0265\nat 4, n.2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999): An \u201cAdministrative Judge is not required to accept unrebutted evidence uncritically\nor without considering it in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  \n \n5\n\nSOR Amendment\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in amending the SOR.    \nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his own\nmotion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it\nin conformity with the evidence . . . When such amendments are made, the\nAdministrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s request for such additional time as the\nAdministrative Judge may deem appropriate for further preparation or other good\ncause. [ Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.] \nWe review a Judge\u2019s decision to amend an SOR for an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-00019 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2014).\nAs noted above, evidence was adduced at the hearing that Applicant had not filed his 2016\nFederal income tax return in a timely fashion.  Tr. at 35-37; Applicant Exhibit (AE) Y.  Department\nCounsel moved to amend the SOR to add an allegation to that effect, the SOR being silent on the\npoint.  The Judge overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and granted the motion.  Tr. at 81-83.  At the close\nof the hearing, Applicant requested three months in which to address the new allegation.  The Judge\nheld the record open from August 9, 2018, the date of the hearing, until September 27, 2018.  Tr.\nat 94.  Accordingly, the amendment was founded upon evidence that was properly before the Judge,\nand it rendered the SOR in conformity therewith.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s decision to grant\nApplicant less additional time than he requested, although he allowed him well over a month and\na half after the hearing to present evidence in mitigation of the new allegation.  The Judge did not\nabuse his discretion in amending the SOR.\nRemaining Issues\nWe find no support for Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge improperly limited his ability\nto present evidence in mitigation.  Neither do we conclude that the Judge made improper use of the\nnon-alleged conduct noted in his findings.  A Judge may consider non-alleged conduct on such\nthings as evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, performing a whole-person analysis, and\nmaking a credibility determination.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16,\n2017).  Applicant was not denied the due process that the Directive affords.\nThe Judge did not err in finding that Applicant had not received financial counseling.  The\nrecord does not support Applicant\u2019s argument that, under the facts of this case, his use of a CPA\nsatisfied the requirements of Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(c).  After reviewing the record, we\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute\nreasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not\nidentified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).\n6\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief is, to a large extent, a challenge to the manner in which the Judge weighed\nthe evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  A person who fails to file\ntax returns and pay taxes when due does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and\nreliability required of those granted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01256 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 29, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant  requested a hearing. \nOn October 12, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree and requires a clearance as a condition of his current\nemployment by a Defense contractor.  He is married with two grown children.  Applicant has\nnumerous delinquent debts.  The ones that the Judge found against him were for credit card accounts\nand a line of credit provided by a bank.  Applicant attributed his financial problems to several\ncauses\u2013his failure to monitor spending or maintain a budget; his having refinanced his home to pay\noff credit card debt; and his mismanagement of an inheritance that he received upon the death of his\nmother.  \nApplicant sought the assistance of an attorney to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on his\nbehalf.  Accordingly, he stopped paying on credit cards, as they were to be included in the\nbankruptcy petition.  Applicant\u2019s attorney did not file a petition, however, because he \u201ckept trying\nto figure out the right formula.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Subsequently Applicant discovered a means of debt\nresolution propounded by a radio personality.  He began selling some of his assets in order to build\nup a cash emergency fund, and he sold off a vehicle.  However, he still did not have enough funds\nto pay off his credit card debts. \nAlthough Applicant stated on more than one occasion that he would pay all of his debts, as\nof the close of the record he had failed to do so.  For example, he claimed that he would resolve his\nlargest account, a credit card debt for nearly $23,000, by withdrawing from his retirement fund, but\nhe provided no evidence that this debt had been paid or settled.  Neither did he demonstrate\nresolution of two relatively small credit card accounts.  He did present evidence that the creditor of\na $4500 charged-off account had forgiven $3,472 and that he testified that he had paid taxes on this\namount.  In the Analysis, however, the Judge stated that it was not clear from the record whether\nApplicant still owed some portion of the debt that might be attributable to interest or penalties. \nApplicant self-reported his financial problems to his employer, and he has handled classified\ninformation properly.  A supervisor from a previous job recommended him for a clearance, provided\nhe addresses his financial situation.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised three disqualifying conditions:\ninability to satisfy debts, a history of not meeting financial obligations, and consistent\noverspending.1  Regarding four debts, including the largest addressed above, she concluded that\nApplicant had not demonstrated mitigation.  She noted that creditors were willing to settle, although\nApplicant did not have on hand sufficient funds to make even the reduced amounts.  She stated that\nApplicant does not have pending settlement offers or plans.  She noted Applicant\u2019s evidence that\nhis difficulties were, in large part, due to his having failed to budget his expenses, his reliance upon\ncredit cards, etc.  She also noted evidence that Applicant had engaged in new spending by using\ndiscretionary funds that could have been directed toward debt payment.  In the whole-person\nanalysis, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant had properly handled classified information while\nundergoing financial difficulties.  She stated, however, that once a security concern arises, there is\na strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a clearance.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that he has resolved all of his debts.  His argument includes assertions from\noutside the record, which we cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  In any event, even if debts have\nbeen resolved a Judge may still consider the underlying circumstances for what they may reveal\nabout the applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02246 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 8, 2017).  He cites to aspects of the record that he contends are favorable to him, such as his\nefforts at debt settlement, the debt that the creditor forgave, his full disclosure of his financial\nproblems to his employer, his credit reports which he argues show that his debts have been resolved,\nand his good security record.  On this last point, the government need not wait until an individual\nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security\nclearance decision.  Even those with good prior records can encounter circumstances in which their\njudgment and reliability might be compromised.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07941 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 29, 2018).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id.  Applicant cites to a portion of his clearance interview\nsummary which states that he cannot be blackmailed or coerced due to his financial difficulties. \nHowever, this represents the interviewer\u2019s summary of Applicant\u2019s answers, not the interviewer\u2019s\nindependent judgment as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  Even if it did represent the\ninterviewer\u2019s opinion it would not bind the Government in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-03995 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2017).        \nGiven Applicant\u2019s history of overspending and evidence that as of the close of the record he\nstill had not resolved his delinquent debts, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s overall adverse\nconclusion.  The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation\nfor the decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \n1See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 (a), (c), and (e).\n3\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 1, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline M (Use of\nInformation Technology), and Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 11, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant was terminated from a previous employment.  The reasons for this termination\nwere that he installed unauthorized software on his work computer; created five \u201cadministrative\naccounts,\u201d some in the names of co-workers, on a classified system without obtaining approval; and\nfalsified his time card over a seven-day period, during which he spent the majority of his time on\nnon-work related activities.  Applicant claimed that he did not know that the software he installed\nwas not authorized and that he had authority to create the administrative accounts.  He did not\ncorroborate these assertions.  Applicant submitted five letters of support, but none of them shed light\nupon his misconduct.  \nThe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s security-significant conduct was intentional, unauthorized,\nand occurred within two and a half years prior to the hearing.  He noted Applicant\u2019s falsified time\ncards and other misconduct, stating that he showed little or no remorse.  Though noting evidence\nthat Applicant is well-respected in his current job, he found that the record left him with questions\nand doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider, or that he mis-weighed, favorable record\nevidence, such as his claim that he had approval for some of his conduct and that his conduct\noccurred over two years prior to the hearing.  He argues that his infractions were relatively minor\nand that he had not been properly trained.  Applicant takes exception to the Judge\u2019s comments that\nhe had acted intentionally and that he lacked remorse, thereby challenging the Judge\u2019s adverse\ncredibility determination.  On this last point, we give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The evidence, which includes his prior employer\u2019s written\nsummary of the things that led to his firing, support the challenged finding.  Indeed, the number of\ninfractions suggest that they were not merely inadvertent or negligent.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08163 at 5 (App.  Bd. Oct. 25, 2017) (Multiple false statements support a finding of intentional\nmisbehavior).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15,\n2\n\n2019).  We give due consideration to the Hearing Office case that Applicant has cited.  However,\nHearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing Office Judges or on the Appeal Board.  Each\ncase must be adjudicated on its own merits.  The cited case does not provide a reason to conclude\nthat the Judge erred in his analysis or conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App.\nBd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nDecember 6, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government failed to establish\nthe sole SOR allegation and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, served honorably in the military for about five years.  He is\nmarried, has one child, and his wife is expecting another.   Since earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in\n2009, he has worked for Federal contractors with some periods of unemployment.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated from a defense contractor position in 2016\nfor falsifying his timecards.  In 2014, he began working full time for two defense contractors.  He \nworked the day shift for one and the night shift for the other.  In 2016, he was required to complete\nten on-line training courses for one employer that was expected to take a total of about 25 hours to\ncomplete.  He requested to complete these self-paced courses during a 40-hour work week (October\n3-7) while teleworking from home.  His supervisors noted Applicant erroneously billed the 40-hours\non his timecard as overhead rather than training, but he later changed it to reflect eight hours of\ntraining for each of those days.\nIn reviewing the course materials, the supervisors noted that Applicant started and completed\nonly two courses on two of those workdays and that he logged into the training program for only 2\nhours and 15 minutes.  When his supervisors confronted him about this apparent discrepancy,\nApplicant stated that he conducted eight hours of training on all five days but was unable to explain\nthe incongruity.  Applicant offered to change his timecard to reflect 40-hours of personal time off\nand was told to resubmit an accurate time card.  He resubmitted the timecard so that it reflected 25\nhours of training and 15 hours of personal time.  The supervisors decided that Applicant had a\nsufficient opportunity to be truthful and recommended he be terminated.  The human resources (HR)\noffice later issued a memorandum noting Applicant routinely reported working 40 hours but his\nbadge swipes showed a patten of working fewer hours and coworker corroborated that he often left\nearly.  His employer subsequently terminated him.\nApplicant denied that he falsified his timecards.  He claimed his immediate supervisor gave\nhim permission to submit a timecard reflecting 25 hours of training and thought there was a lack of\ncommunication between the immediate supervisor and the next-level supervisor.  Instead of\nwatching the training videos and then taking the associated test, he claims he worked the whole\nweek, first watching all the training videos, and then taking all the tests at the end of the week.  He\n2\n\ncontends that he received credit for only a few hours of training because he just passed two or three\nof the tests and did not receive credit for taking tests he did not pass. \nBefore the hearing, Applicant reached out to his former supervisor to confirm his claims. \nThe former supervisor had been advised to refer Applicant back to the HR office, which Applicant\ndid without success.  He sought to subpoena the former supervisor to testify, but was advised the\nJudge did not have authority to subpoena witnesses.   He continues to work for the other defense\ncontractor and received a favorable 2018 mid-term review.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cGE 3, GE 4, and GE 5 are company business records establishing that Applicant was\nterminated [in late 2016] for what the company concluded was falsification of his timecards.  An\nemployer\u2019s characterization of events underlying an adverse action are entitled to some deference.1\nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the reasons for his termination is not enough to overcome that\npresumption.\u201d  Decision at 8.   Applicant\u2019s assertion that his supervisor told him to change his\ntimecard to reflect 25 hours of training is simply not credible.  His testimony that he was not credited\nfor logging in for tests he failed is not credible.  No personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \nApplicant asserts that the Judge \u201cgave deference to the Government, raising concerns of Due\nProcess\u201d and established one standard for the Government and another for him for presenting\nevidence.  Appeal Brief at 1-2.  To the extent that he is arguing the Judge is biased, we do not find\nthis contention persuasive.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a judge is impartial and unbiased,\nand a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 17-00661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2018).   We find nothing in the record either to persuade\na reasonable person that the Judge lacked impartiality or to show the Judge applied different\nstandards to the parties for presenting evidence.  Applicant has failed to met his heavy burden of\npersuasion to establish bias.  Both parties were provided an equal opportunity to present evidence\nsupporting their cases.\n  \nApplicant contends the Government failed to present evidence establishing he falsified his\ntimecard by stating \u201cthe Government never presented any \u2018evidence\u2019 raising security concerns but\nmade allegation without any supporting documentation\u201d and  \u201ccompany records . . . should be\nconsidered allegations not evidence.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also notes he did not have the\nopportunity to cross-examine witnesses and asserts his former company could have furnished\n1 The Judge cited two Appeal Board decision for this proposition, i.e., ISCR Case No. 14-00114 at 3 (App. Bd.\nSep. 30, 2014)(citing ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2012). \n3\n\ndocuments, such as computer logs or training records, to support their claim, but did not do so. \nThese contentions lack merit.  A Judge\u2019s findings must be supported by substantial evidence, i.e.,\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See also, ISCR Case\nNo. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  In this case, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s timecard\nfalsification was based on business records (GE 3, GE 4, and GE 5), which are an admissible form\nof evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.  See, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(6).  See also, ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).  Moreover, an\napplicant\u2019s right to confrontation is not violated by admission of documents that fall within well-\nestablished exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as the business records exception.  Id.2  Furthermore,\nthe Directive does not require either party to present specific types of evidence, such as computer\nlogs, to prove controverted facts.  Finally, business records need not be independently corroborated\nto be admissible into evidence.  In this case, the Judge\u2019s material findings were based on substantial\nevidence.  Applicant has failed to establish he was not afforded the due process rights afforded him\nunder the Directive.  \nApplicant also notes that the Judge highlighted his failure to corroborate his testimony, while\nthe Government did not corroborate the business records that it offered into evidence.  This\nargument, in essence, is a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  In this regard,\nApplicant also cites to his military service, educational and athletic achievements, family situation,\nand other accomplishments.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Nussbaum, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision under both Guidelines ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Consistent with\nthe following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant engaged the services of prostitutes from the early 1990s until at least 2014.  Most\nof these incidents occurred in foreign countries, where prostitution was legal.  However, on one\noccasion in 2010 or 2011 he engaged a prostitute in the U.S.  He knew that this incident was not\nlegal but did not consider it a \u201cmajor crime.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Applicant\u2019s wife suffers from a medical\ncondition that has substantially diminished her sex drive, although there is intimacy between them. \nApplicant and she have attended counseling but with limited effect.  In addition, Applicant had an\nextramarital affair in about 2007, which lasted about six months.  Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of this\naffair.  However, she is not aware of his interactions with prostitutes.  \nApplicant did not disclose his affair during an October 2014 polygraph examination.  He\nstated that the reason for this omission was that the examination focused upon prostitution.  He\ndisclosed the affair during the post-test interview along with his reasons for the prior omission.  In\naddition, Applicant did not disclose the incident of prostitution that occurred in the U.S. on his 2017\nsecurity clearance application (SCA).  However, he did disclose this incident during his October\n2014 polygraph.\nApplicant submitted to an evaluation by a licensed psychologist, who concluded that he was\nfree from any major psychological diagnosis.  He stated that there is no reason to believe that\nApplicant\u2019s security-significant conduct will recur.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for\nreliability, honesty, and trustworthiness.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge noted that Applicant last engaged a prostitute four years ago and that he has stated\nthat he will never do so again.  He testified credibly that he cannot be blackmailed, plausibly\nexplaining why he has not disclosed his misconduct to his wife.  Regarding Guideline E, the Judge\ncited to Applicant\u2019s explanation for having failed to disclose his extramarital affair during his\nOctober 2014 polygraph.  He found credible Applicant\u2019s claim that the exam had focused on\nprostitution and that he believed that his affair was not something that he had to admit.\n2\n\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure\n2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nA security clearance decision must be based upon a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence viewed as a cumulative whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-04813 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31,\n2015).  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record.  However, a Judge\nshould not ignore significant record evidence that a reasonable person would expect  to be addressed. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  Department Counsel argues that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision did not devote attention to significant contrary evidence.  She argues that the\ndecision is not sustainable because it runs contrary to the greater weight of the evidence.  \nWe find Department Counsel\u2019s argument to be persuasive.  We note the following findings\nand /or record evidence that undercut the Judge\u2019s favorable decision:\nApplicant engaged the services of prostitutes over a period of several years.  Decision\nat 2-3; Response to SOR at 1; Tr. at 39.\nApplicant was first approved for a clearance in 2008.  Government Exhibit (GE) 1,\n2017 Security Clearance Application at 38.  He engaged prostitutes about eleven\ntimes between 2010 and 2014.  Tr. at 39.  Therefore, many of these incidents took\nplace while Applicant held a clearance.\nAlthough most of the incidents occurred in foreign countries where such conduct was\nlegal, one of them occurred in the U.S., where it was illegal.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 40,\n80.\n3\n\nApplicant did not disclose this U.S. offense in his 2017 SCA.  Decision at 4; GE 1\nat 38.  The offense in the U.S. is the only one which Applicant understood to have\nbeen illegal.  Decision at 4.\nApplicant has not disclosed his prostitution offenses to his wife, because he is\nconcerned about the effect it will have on her.  Tr. at 48.  \nApplicant engaged in a six-month extramarital affair, of which his wife is aware. \nDecision at 4; Tr. at 89.    \nHowever, Applicant did not disclose this affair during the October 2014 polygraph\nexamination.  He did disclose it during the post-test interview following a subsequent\npolygraph.  He stated that the reason that he had not disclosed it in 2014 was that\n\u201c[he] was afraid that it would [a]ffect his security processing, and [he] was\nembarrassed.\u201d Polygraph Report dated March 3, 2015, included in GE 3.  \n  This evidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s alleged sexual behavior occurred while he held\na clearance; that it included an incident that was illegal in the U.S. jurisdiction where it occurred;\nand that he failed to be totally candid about his security-significant offenses during the investigation\nand adjudication of his case.  We find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable decision failed adequately to address this evidence as a whole.  In particular, we note that\nthe Judge did not address Applicant\u2019s admission that, during his 2014 polygraph, he had withheld\ninformation about his affair because he was afraid of the affect it might have on his access to\nclassified information.  The Directive is clear that it is of special concern for an applicant to fail to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the processing of an SCA.  It also states that \u201c[t]he\nfollowing will normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination . . . : (b)\nrefusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security\nofficials, or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security . . . determination.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 15.  Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s failure to have admitted his six-month\naffair until it was discovered during the course of a subsequent polygraph examination raises serious\nconcerns about his willingness to disclose security-significant conduct.  This was a matter that the\nJudge should have addressed forthrightly.  \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s many years of utilizing prostitutes, incidents that he has not admitted\nto his wife because he is not sure how she will respond, raise reasonable concerns about his\njudgment and the extent to which he could be subjected to undue influence or coercion.1  Of course,\nthe Judge was required to consider Applicant\u2019s character evidence and his explanations for his\nmisconduct.  In addition, we give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  However, that deference has its limits.  When a Judge fails to address record evidence\n1See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 12: \u201cThe Concern:  Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects\na lack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nThese issues, together or individually, may raise questions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness,\nand ability to protect classified of sensitive information.\u201d  \n4\n\nthat is contrary to his favorable credibility determination, it provides a serious reason to believe that\nhe has simply substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05565 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2017).  In this case, the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct\u2013especially his omission of material information during his 2014 polygraph\ndue to concern over its effect on his clearance\u2013persuades us that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination\nis not entitled to the deference that we normally extend to such conclusions.  \nGiven the above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider relevant factors and\nruns contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  In light of the totality of the evidence, we\nconclude that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  \nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPatrick J. Hughes, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 25, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On October 3, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all of\nthe evidence in the record and whether the Judge applied the wrong standard in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists several delinquent credit card accounts and three judgments, two of\nwhich he has paid.  Applicant operated a business from 2006 to 2016, which did not succeed,\nespecially in 2014 and later.  He had difficulty paying bills.  Applicant enrolled in debt relief firms. \nHe was not able to make the required payments under the earlier one, and he provided no\ninformation about the status of the other.  Aside from the two judgments that he has paid, Applicant\nsubmitted no evidence of payment on his SOR debts.  He presented no evidence of a budget or of\nhis spending practices.\nGiven the extent of Applicant\u2019s remaining debts, it is likely that his financial problems will\ncontinue into the future.  Although his business failure was a circumstance beyond his control,\nApplicant has not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his delinquent debts.  He has satisfied\nonly two of his SOR debts, even though he has been fully employed since 2016.  He has never had\nfinancial counseling, and, though his debt programs refer to credit counseling, there is no evidence\nas to what this consisted of.  Applicant has not presented meaningful evidence of debt resolution. \nHe is not required to have paid off all debts in the SOR, but he should have a plan to pay his debts,\nsupported by evidence that he is implementing that plan.\nDiscussion\nApplicant has submitted exhibits which were not part of the record.  The Board may not\nconsider new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, in particular\ninformation provided in his Answer to the SOR about his having prioritized payment of non-SOR\nobligations owed to family members.  A Judge is not expected to address everything in the record,\nwhich would be a practical impossibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov.\n30, 2018).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\n2\n\nin the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).  Applicant contends\nthat the Judge held him to an impossibly high standard, in that he stated that Applicant\u2019s problems\nwould likely extend well into the future.  He argues that no one can be expected to remain debt-free. \nHowever, we construe the challenged statement to mean that, despite having held employment since\n2016, Applicant has not established a track record of debt payment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015).  In fact, the Judge acknowledged explicitly that an applicant\nis not required to pay off all debts in order to receive a clearance.  The Judge did not employ the\nwrong standard in resolving Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  Compare, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 27, 2017) \u201c...[T]he Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\n\u2018financial issues are recent and ongoing\u2019...\u201d\nApplicant cites a document the Board sends to the parties in all its cases.  The document\nmentions that the chairperson or designee may vary the terms of the document in certain\ncircumstances.  The document does not say that the provisions of the Directive will be varied. \nIndeed, the Chairperson has no such authority.\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On\nSeptember 5, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecisionCsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 28, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant=s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive && E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge=s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge=s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was 39 years old and was seeking a security clearance\nto work for a defense contractor.  He has earned three master\u2019s degrees.  He is single with no\nchildren.  He was either unemployed or not fully employed for over a year during 2015 and 2016. \nApplicant admitted to four incidents of criminal conduct between 1999 and 2014.  In 1999,\nhe was charged with felony second-degree burglary and misdemeanor stealing when he and a friend\ntook a vacuum cleaner from a house.  He was found guilty of both offenses and placed on probation\nfor five-year and two-year periods.  As result of a fight in 2000, he was charged with two felony\noffenses.  A first-degree assault charge alleged that he caused serious physical injury another.  This\noffense occurred when he was striking one individual with a pistol that fell to the ground discharging\na round into another individual.  He pled guilty to a reduced assault charge and armed criminal\naction, and he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for one charge and three years for the\nother.  He served about three years in prison.1 \nIn 2009, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and reckless\noperation after a single-car accident.  He refused a roadside alcohol test.  Those charges were\ndisposed of through Applicant\u2019s completion of a pretrial intervention program.  In 2014, he was\ncharged with second-degree domestic assault, a felony.  This occurred when he had an argument and\nphysical altercation with his girlfriend in a restaurant after drinking shots of alcohol.  He pled guilty\nto a misdemeanor domestic assault charge and was sentenced to one year of confinement\n(suspended) and two years of probation under court supervision.  He was also required to complete\nan alcohol evaluation.  The court granted Applicant\u2019s request to terminate the probation shortly\nbefore he began his current employment.\n1 Since Applicant was sentenced to, and incarcerated for, more than one-year as a result of this conviction, he is\ndisqualified under the Bond Amendment from being granted or renewed access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI), Special Access Programs (SAP), or Restricted Data (RD).  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. B \u00b6 2. \n2\n\nApplicant also has a history of financial problems.  He admitted that he had 16 delinquent\naccounts totaling about $41,100.  With the assistance of a firm, he entered into a debt resolution\nagreement in which he agreed to make a monthly payments of about $300 for 11 delinquent accounts\nstarting in October 2017.  He stated he has made all payments under the agreement but did not\npresent supporting documentation.   He has not shown that any of the alleged accounts are resolved. \nHe described his financial situation as living paycheck to paycheck and owes about $200,000 in non-\nalleged student loans that are in deferment.  He expects the student loans to become due about three\nmonths after the hearing.  Through documents and four witnesses, he presented a wealth of favorable\ncharacter evidence. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his history of criminal conduct. \nAlthough he has taken the initial steps to address his financial problems, it is too early to tell if he\nwill adhere to his debt resolution agreement.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant does not dispute any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  He contends that the Judge\ndid not consider all of the record evidence and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person concept.  For example, he asserts:\n[The Judge] fails to make mention that one of the root causes of the financial issues \nis the untimely and unanticipated health issues of [Applicant\u2019s] father that caused\nhim to leave his state of residence and travel to [another state] to care for his father. \nThis is a proper mitigating condition under the Guidelines that [the Judge] never\nmentions.  [Appeal Brief at 7.]\nThe Judge, however, made a finding of fact that Applicant attended to a family member with a\nserious illness during his period of unemployment.  See Decision at 3.  Applicant\u2019s arguments on\nappeal are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\nin the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to establish that the Judge erred in his whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant has failed to establish harmful error below.  The Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on\nthis record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 9, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), Guideline\nM (Use of Information Technology), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April\n12, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nMichael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether his right of cross-examination was\ndenied and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant is 57 years old, is a retired military member, and has worked in the industrial\nsecurity field for a number of years.  The SOR alleged that Applicant mishandled company\nproprietary information in 2015 when he transferred over 1,600 files to a company-approved external\nhard drive without authorization.  It also alleged that, during an investigation into that matter,\nApplicant was asked to return the hard drive, intentionally returned another hard drive, and then\nintentionally and without authorization destroyed the hard drive in question.  The Judge found\nagainst Applicant on both of those allegations.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on a third\nallegation that has not been raised as an issue on appeal.  \nApplicant provides varying accounts of the 2015 incident.  This incident came to light after\nApplicant and other employees had received layoff notices and were placed on elevated computer\nand email monitoring.  Additionally, a retroactive 90-day download report was generated that\nrevealed Applicant\u2019s multiple downloads to an external device.  When confronted by a company\nofficial about the downloads, Applicant denied downloading information to a personal hard drive. \nHe later destroyed the company-owed external hard drive.  \u201cThe investigation by Applicant\u2019s former\nemployer substantiated the allegations of damage to the company\u2019s assets and unauthorized\ndownloads.\u201d  Decision at 6.  Applicant resigned in lieu of termination from that former position.   \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nhis intentional destruction of a company external hard drive to which he had transferred about 1,600\nfiles, including proprietary information, before beginning another job in the defense industry.  There\nare two main concerns: (1) Applicant gave varying accounts of the incident, and (2) he did not\nconduct himself as an honest person by not returning the external hard drive to his employer while\nhe still had it.  Applicant\u2019s transgressions were serious misconduct.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant cites to \u201cExecutive Order 10865[\u00a7 3](6) and DoDD 5220. 6,\nparagraph  4.3.3\" in arguing that his right of cross-examination was denied because he did not have\n2\n\nan opportunity to cross-examine the persons who produced Government Exhibit (GE) 2.  Appeal\nBrief at 2.  GE 2 consists of a document from Applicant\u2019s former employment record and a summary\nof an inquiry the former employer conducted into Applicant\u2019s downloading of files onto an external\ndevice.  In the decision, the Judge noted that the summary of the inquiry was prepared more than two\nyears after the incident in question and two days before the hearing was originally scheduled to be\nheld.  The Judge stated, \u201cit is obvious that the [summary] was prepared for the purpose of litigation\nin this case . . . .\u201d  Decision at 3.  The Judge also noted that the summary was not self-authenticating,\nwas not authenticated by a witness, and Applicant had no opportunity to cross-examine the person\nwho prepared it.  At the hearing, Applicant was represented by counsel.  During the hearing, the\nJudge asked Applicant\u2019s Counsel whether he had any objections to the admission of GE 2 into\nevidence.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel responded, \u201cNo objections . . . .\u201d  Tr. at 14.  In the decision, the\nJudge indicated that, although the summary was admitted without objection, he would weigh it in\nlight of the issues he highlighted.  In the past, the Appeal Board has held that an appealing party must\ntake timely, reasonable steps to raise objections or other procedural matters to preserve them for\nappeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08813 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2005).  See also  ISCR Case No.\n03-00543 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 21, 2004)(discussing the purposes served in raising evidentiary or\nprocedural objections at the hearing).  Having failed to raise an appropriate objection below,\nApplicant cannot claim on appeal the Judge\u2019s consideration of GE 2 was error.  From review of the\nrecord, Applicant has not established that the right of cross-examination afforded him in the\nExecutive Order or Directive was denied because the Judge considered GE 2.     \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the downloaded files contained proprietary\ninformation.  In the findings of fact, the Judge stated \u201cApplicant had conducted multiple downloads\nto a \u2018possible personal external device,\u2019 since September 2015, with more than 1600 files being\nmoved, to include presumed personal files and company files that likely contained company\nproprietary information (e.g., security-related forms, presentation, templates, and letters).\u201d \n[Emphasis added.]  Decision at 6-7.  This finding is almost a verbatim quote (with some minor \nexceptions such as the deletion of the company\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s names) from a sentence in the\nsummary of the inquiry (GE 2).  In his analysis, however, the Judge stated Applicant \u201chad transferred\nor moved approximately 1,600 files, which included company proprietary information[.]\u201d [Emphasis\nadded.] Decision at 9.  In his brief, Applicant contends that it is speculation that the hard drive in\nquestion contained any company proprietary information.  Given the nature and quantity of the\ndownloaded files, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that proprietary information was included in those files was\na reasonable inference based on information in GE 2.  At most, the Judge\u2019s conclusion was a\nharmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR 11-15184 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  He argues, for example, that his downloading of the files was done in the best\ninterests of the former employer and that he had no intent to harm the former employer.  These\narguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22,\n2017). \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 12, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 26, 2019, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on SOR allegations asserting that he received a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy discharge in 2017; that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2013-2016\nas required; that he owed about $740 in state regional income taxes for 2013; and that he owes about\n$1,700 in Federal income taxes for 2013-2016.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two other\nGuideline F allegations and all of the Guideline G allegations.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings are\nnot at issue on appeal.     \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant denied that he failed to file his Federal tax returns as\nrequired.  On appeal, he again makes that assertion, arguing he either filed on time or before six-\nmonth extensions expired.  In the decision, the Judge found that Applicant filed his 2013 Federal\nincome tax return on May 12, 2014 with no indication an extension was granted; that he filed his\n2014 return in November 2015, which was about a month after a filing extension due date; that he\nfiled his 2015 return on December 5, 2016, which was about two months after a filing extension due\ndate; and that he filed his 2016 return on May 29, 2017, with no indication an extension was granted. \nIn responding to interrogatories, Applicant submitted his IRS tax transcripts for each year in\nquestion.  From our review of the IRS tax transcripts, we are unsure exactly when Applicant filed\nhis tax returns.  For example, his 2013 Federal tax transcript contains the following information:\nRETURN DUE DATE OR RETURN RECEIVED DATE (WHICHEVER IS LATER)   Apr. 15, 2014\nPROCESSING DATE \n       May 12, 2014\nTRANSACTIONS \nCODE    EXPLANATION OF TRANSACTION\nCYCLE\nDATE\n           AMOUNT\n150\nTax return filed\n20141705\n05-12-2014       $5,798.00\nThe first two lines quoted above reflect that Applicant filed his tax return on or before April 15,\n2014, which would have been an on-time filing, and the IRS processed the return on May 12, 2014. \nOn the other hand, the bottom-quoted line apparently reflects that the return was filed on 5-12-2014,\nwhich would have about a month late absent the filing for an automatic extension.  The Judge did\nnot address this apparent conflict about the filing date in the decision.  Each of Applicant\u2019s tax\ntranscripts for the years in question contains a similar conflict.1  We note that the IRS Master File\n1 Viewing the tax transcripts in a light most favorable to Applicant, his 2014 and 2015 tax transcripts still reflect\nthat he filed those tax returns four days and two days after approved automatic extension due dates.  Such minor filing\ndeficiencies, however, do not raise security concerns.  \n2\n\nCodes2 indicate that Transaction Code 150 is for \u201cReturn Filed & Tax Liability Assessed,\u201d which\nappears to involve the processing of the return to assess the tax owed and might explain why an\namount is reflected on that transaction line and why the Transaction Code 150 date would also match\nthe processing date for a routine individual tax return.  This observation in not a finding of fact and\nis not binding on the Administrative Judge.   \nA Judge\u2019s task is to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  In light of Applicant\u2019s SOR response denying the alleged tax\nfiling deficiencies, we conclude the Judge erred in failing to address in his decision the contradiction\nin the IRS tax transcripts about the filing dates and then explain how he was resolving those\nconflicts.  Given that Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts total about $2,500, we cannot conclude\na possible error in finding against Applicant on the tax filing deficiencies was harmless.3     \nAccordingly, we remand the case for the Judge to reopen the record to provide the parties an\nopportunity to present evidence and address the apparent conflict in the tax transcripts about tax\nreturn filing dates and to issue a new decision in accordance with the Directive. \n2 https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/6209-section-8a-2012.pdf\n3 In his appeal brief, Applicant also contends that he paid his Federal tax debt before the Judge issued the\ndecision, but there is no evidence in the record to support that claim.  \n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On\nDecember 21, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  Subsequently, Department Counsel withdrew the\nGuideline E allegations.  On January 2, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nhis circumstances raised security concerns and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to the issues raised on appeal:\nApplicant was chief executive officer and primary owner of a Subchapter S corporation, which\npasses income, losses, deductions and credits on to shareholders.  In 2011, he sold a division of this\ncompany, resulting in an adjusted gross income to him of nearly $6,000,000 and a tax liability of\nover $1,000,000.  Although Applicant made some payments toward his tax debt, including a\npayment of $200,000,  as of the close of the record he owed the IRS over $700,000 for tax year\n2011.  He also owed the IRS over $60,000 for 2012.  Applicant testified that he relied on the advice\nof an accountant to address the tax liability resulting from the sale of the division.  Rather than pay\nthe full amount of tax due, Applicant spent the proceeds from the sale on investing in the remainder\nof the company, paying off the mortgage on his home, paying off credit cards and loans, and setting\naside funds for his children\u2019s college.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised Guideline F disqualifying\nconditions, including the one found at Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 19(f): \u201cfailure to pay annual\nFederal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d  He found that Applicant had mitigated some of the\nSOR debts, though not those arising from his tax obligations.  He concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax\nliabilities are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability.  He also\nstated that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his tax problems.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in holding that his tax debts raise security concerns. \nHowever, the Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant\u2019s ongoing tax debts raise concerns that\nhe may be lacking in qualities expected of those with access to classified information.  Indeed, the\nDirective presumes that there is a nexus between admitted or proved conduct under any of the\n2\n\nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) .   Substantial tax obligations that have remained unresolved over several\nyears, despite an apparent ability to have addressed them, are sufficient to uphold the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion under Disqualifying Condition 19(f).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 17-01256\nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018) (A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations,\nsuch as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and\nreliability required of those granted access to classified information).\n  \nApplicant cites to record evidence that he argues is favorable to him, such as his reliance\nupon poor advice from his former accountant, his having hired a new one, and his efforts to address\nhis debts.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\nin the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). \nMoreover, despite Applicant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complied\nwith the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he considered the totality of the evidence in reaching\nhis decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.
