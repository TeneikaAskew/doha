Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Drug Involvement security concerns but failed to mitigate \nthe Personal Conduct concerns raised by her false answers in a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions in 2006, and in her response to interrogatories in 2007. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn May 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 12, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on July 11, 2008. A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity \nto file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 19, 2008. She responded with an \nundated letter and two attached performance appraisals. Department Counsel did not \nobject to her response. I have marked Applicant\u2019s response as Exhibits (Ex.) A through \nC, and they are admitted. I received the case assignment on September 3, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nthe same company since 2006. She attended community college. She served in the \nU.S. military from 1995 to 1997, and was honorably discharged. Applicant is divorced \nand has a five-year-old child.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on April 24, 2004, and charged with operating while \nintoxicated (OWI). She pled guilty on May 18, 2004, to operating while impaired by \nliquor. She was sentenced to one day in jail, with credit for one day of time served, \nordered to pay fines and costs of $1,035, and to attend outpatient treatment.2  \n \n \nApplicant attended treatment. Her discharge summary dated August 5, 2004, \nstated: \n \nProgress/Lack of Progress Client reports great progress. She is no \nlonger using alcohol or marijuana. She reports feeling better physically \nand emotionally. Client attended 8 sessions of outpatient therapy. She \nappears highly motivated to staying free of drugs and alcohol.3 \n \nApplicant was recommended to continue to attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. The final diagnosis included alcohol abuse and marijuana abuse. The \ndischarge summary included a \u201cClinician\u2019s Signature\u201d by an \u201cMSW,\u201d which normally \nrefers to a master\u2019s degree in social work.4 I find that Applicant used marijuana an \nindeterminate number of times prior to August 2004. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges \u201c[i]n a report of medical history dated December 17, 1994 \n[Applicant] admitted to being a marijuana user.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegation but \nqualified her admission by stating \u201cI do not recall the incident in Paragraph 1.a, but I do \nbelieve you have documentation to support it so, I do not deny it.\u201d The government did \nnot provide independent evidence of this allegation in the FORM. She reiterated in her \nresponse to the FORM that she did not recall using drugs in 1994. \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 4, 5, 7. \n \n3 Item 6. \n \n4 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on May 15, 2006. She denied using any illegal controlled substance, \nincluding marijuana, during the previous seven years.5 This was an intentionally false \nanswer. \n \n \nApplicant responded to interrogatories on June 12, 2007. She answered \u201cno\u201d to \nthe question that asked if she had \u201cused any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, \nhallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) and/ or any Cannabis (to include marijuana and \nhashish), except prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d This was an intentionally false \nanswer. Applicant stated that she provided the false information because \u201cI very \ndesperately want the job I currently have and this is why I omitted any drug use.\u201d6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s job from 2004 through 2006 required random drug testing, which she \npassed. She moved to a different state in 2006. She stated that she will never use \nmarijuana again and she would readily submit to any random drug testing. She further \nstated \u201cI admit and deeply regret the mistakes I have made and I will gladly accept any \nconsequences that come with it.\u201d Her performance appraisals reflect excellent job \nperformance during the last two years.7   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n                                                          \n5 Item 4. \n \n6 Items 3, 7. \n \n7 AE A-C. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \nand \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession8 and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) \nas disqualifying conditions. The final diagnosis upon her discharge from treatment \nincluded marijuana abuse. The clinician was an MSW, but it is unclear who made the \nactual diagnosis. The evidence is insufficient to completely qualify as a disqualifying \ncondition under either AG \u00b6 25(d) or (e).  \n \nThree Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana prior to August 2004. How much and how often is \nunclear because she falsified her response to interrogatories. There is no evidence that \nshe has used illegal drugs in the last four years. She receives some credit under AG \u00b6 \n26(a). She moved to a different state in 2006. She signed a statement of intent that she \nwill not use illegal drugs in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable. She completed a court-\nordered treatment program. Her clinician wrote that \u201c[s]he appears highly motivated to \nstaying free of drugs and alcohol.\u201d That is commendatory but is insufficient to qualify as \n                                                          \n8 Drugs must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n6 \n \na favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) is partially \napplicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified her SF 86 in 2006. She lied in her response to \ninterrogatories in June 2007. Both of the above disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n7 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and the individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \n \nI have considered all the potential mitigating conditions. Applicant submitted her \nSF 86 in May 2006. She deliberately failed to disclose her past drug use. She again \nprovided false information in 2007. Applicant has not submitted sufficient credible \ninformation to establish any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant used marijuana prior to \n\n \n8 \n \n2004. There is no evidence that she has used illegal drugs since then. She intentionally \nfalsified her SF 86 in 2006, when she failed to list her drug use. She compounded her \nwrongdoing by again providing false information in her June 2007 response to \ninterrogatories. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service and her excellent job \nperformance. However, her repeated dishonesty calls in question her judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and falsification of her clearance application render her\nan unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 27 July 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 23 August 2007, and\n1\n\n2\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 12 September 2007, and I convened a hearing 11\nOctober 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 24 October 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the financial allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.g.,\n1.h., 1.r., and 1.q. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She denied falsifying\nher clearance application. She is a 42-year-old logistician aide for a defense contractor since July\n1995. She has not previously held a clearance.\nWhen Applicant submitted her clearance application in December 2006 (G.E. 1), she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to two questions (questions 28 a. and b.) asking if she had been 180 days delinquent\non any accounts  within the last seven years, or was currently 90 days delinquent on any account. In\nfact, she was more than 90 days delinquent on 18 accounts totaling over $27,000. Applicant has\noffered no credible explanation for her failure to disclose her financial difficulties. Indeed, she\nacknowledged (Tr 60) that she knew at the time that she should have answered \u201cyes.\u201d Applicant\nknew that she had been receiving collection letters from the creditors, and had long since stopped\npaying most of her creditors.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 1999, the point at which she lost\ncontrol of her finances. She cites no precipitating event for her financial difficulties (Tr 58), except\nfor being a single mother of three, living beyond her means (Tr. 34). \nApplicant acknowledges that she incurred each of the debts alleged in the SOR, and at some\npoint stopped payment on each account (Tr. 38-40). Of the 11 delinquent accounts she denied, only\ntwo were paid: SOR 1.n. was largely paid by garnishment of her wages, and 1.o. was paid when the\nIRS seized her income tax refund to pay an outstanding education loan. Applicant denies the\nremaining nine because she is working with a credit repair organization to have them removed from\nher credit report due to them being more than seven years old. She states an intent to pay \u201cevery\nsingle debt that I need to satisfy\u201d (Tr. 28), and to that end has taken a part-time job and a roommate.\nShe intends to pay her debts in the next 7-8 months. However, she had not yet made any payment\narrangement with her creditors, as she was focusing on getting aged debts off her credit report.\nHowever, this seems more aimed a cleaning up her credit report, as she is trying to buy a house (Tr.\n43-44). \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n4\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n3\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect over $27,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired since 1999, because she could not or would not live within her means.3\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Applicant has not\n4\nestablished that her debts were due to circumstances beyond her control, or that she has acted\nresponsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or\n5\notherwise brought the problem under control.  The credit repair firm does not appear to be involved\n6\nin counseling beyond the steps to improve her credit score so she can buy a house. Further, removing\nseven-year-old debts from her credit report (a federal requirement) does not necessarily end her legal\nresponsibility for the debts, which is governed by state statutes-of-limitation. Applicant has taken\n\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n\u00b616.(a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel\n8\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a)  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n9\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n\u00b617.(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or significantly contributed\n10\nto by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process . . . [later] the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n4\nno verifiable steps to address her debts.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will\n7\nbe able to remain financially stable in the future. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed the nature and extent of her financial\nproblems.  Further, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. There is no evidence\n8\ndemonstrating that she corrected the falsification before being asked about it.  There is no evidence\n9\nto suggest that Applicant receive bad advice about what she was required to disclose on her clearance\napplication.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on July 19, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 3, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\nhearing took place as scheduled on December 19, 2007, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on January 10, 2008.\nThe record was left open until December 28, 2007, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The post-\nhearing matters are marked and admitted as follows: (1) documentary exhibits\nsupplementing Exhibits A through O as designated by Applicant; (2) Applicant\u2019s resume\nas Exhibit P; and (3) an exhibit related to Exhibits A, B, D, F, G, and O as Exhibit Q. For\nthe reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts ranging from $218 to\n$13,568 for about $62,000 in total. The debts are described as charged-off bad debts\nand collection accounts. A large part of the indebtedness stems from seven student\nloans for nearly $41,000 in total, on which Applicant was in default. In his response to\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations and provided explanations about\nhis efforts to address the debts. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following\nfacts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 29-year-old programmer. He has worked for his current employer\nsince December 2006. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the Defense\nDepartment the first time.\nHe incurred the student loan obligations while attending college. During\n1996\u20131999, he attended an aeronautical university where he studied engineering and\naerospace studies. He did not earn a degree at that time. During 2000\u20132003, he\nattended another university and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer\nscience in August 2003. He then enrolled in law school, as a part-time student, and was\nrecently awarded a J.D. He was involved in various extracurricular activities in law\nschool, to include serving in the student bar association where he rose to serve as a\nvice-chair at the national level. He is now on an informal leave of absence from his\ndefense contractor employer while he studies for the bar exam. \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in 1997. His mother was diagnosed with\npancreatic cancer in 2006 and passed away in April 2007. As an only child, he assumed\n\n3\nresponsibility for watching over and caring for his mother while she was ill. He withdrew\nfrom law school twice, once to care for her after surgery and then when she was gravely\nill. On both occasions, Applicant was unable to work. Also as an only child, he was his\nmother\u2019s sole heir. He inherited a used car worth $1,000 to $2,000 and a condo with an\nestimated market value of about $110,000. The condo has a mortgage on it, but there is\napproximately $50,000 in equity in the property. In addition, he  received $50,000 as the\nbeneficiary of his mother\u2019s life-insurance policy. \nApplicant used the windfall to address his outstanding financial obligations. He\nstill has the car and he intends to sell it. He continues to own the condo, which has the\npossibility of producing a monthly income as a rental property. He is not inclined to sell\nthe condo now as the real estate market is relatively weak. The status of his\nindebtedness, as alleged in the SOR, is summarized in the following table. \nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013charged-off credit card\naccount for $3,721.\nSettled in Nov. 2007 (Exhibit A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013charged-off credit card\naccount for $6,482.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit B).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013charged-off credit card\naccount for $5,834.\nSettlement offer pending (Exhibit C).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013charged-off bad debt for\n$1,146.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit D).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013charged-off bad debt for\n$3,579.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit E).\nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013collection account for $427.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit F).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013charged-off bad debt for\n$631.\nSettled in Oct. 2007 (Exhibit G).\nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013student loan for $1,595.\nRepayment agreement since Oct. 2007\n(Exhibits H, I, and J). \nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013student loan for $1,595.\nRepayment agreement since Oct. 2007\n(Exhibits H, I and J).\nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013student loan for $2,100.\nRepayment agreement since Oct. 2007\n(Exhibits H, I, and J).\nSOR \u00b6 1.k\u2013student loan for $9,047.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit K).\nSOR \u00b6 1.l\u2013student loan for $2,736.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit L).\nSOR \u00b6 1.m\u2013student loan for $10,258.\nSettled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit M).\n\n Department of Navy v.

Although he has the money to make the lump-sum payment, he\nwould prefer to resolve the account by a repayment agreement, which would improve\nhis cash flow.\nThe seven student loans belong to two creditors. Four loans belong to one\ncreditor and were settled in September 2007. The three student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h,\n1.i, and 1.j belong to another creditor. Applicant is resolving these three debts by a\nrepayment agreement that began in October 2007 when he made an initial good-faith\npayment for more than $5,000. The repayment agreement, which addresses all three\nstudent loans, calls for him to make monthly payments of $533 until August 2008. He\nmade payments in a timely manner in November and December. \nApplicant has about $15,000 in cash reserves in addition to the car and condo.\nThis money is available to pay for his living expenses while he studies for the bar exam\nas well as for paying debts as discussed above. He attributes his financial problems to\nyouth and inexperience as well as some periodic underemployment and unemployment.\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n18\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.\nOf the mitigating conditions under Guideline F, the most pertinent here is MC 4,\nwhich requires a person to initiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.  Applicant has made substantial efforts to resolve the\n18\ndelinquent debts. He has settled or paid nearly all. One was pending settlement at the\ntime of the hearing and another was three months into a repayment agreement.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn September 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 1, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 31, 2007. Applicant did not\nrespond to the FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41 year old employee of a defense contractor. He was granted a\nDoD security clearance in January 1998.\nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times weekly, from around\n1984 to 1995 or 1996. He used methamphetamine, with varying frequency, at times\nweekly, from around 1993 to sometime in 1995, and again from about 1998 to at least\nJanuary 2003.\nOn or about January 8, 1994, applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence, and (2) Driving While Under the Influence of a Controlled\nSubstance. He pleaded guilty to Count 1. At the time of his arrest, he was under the\ninfluence of methamphetamine. \nOn or about January 15, 2003, applicant was arrested and charged with\nPossession of a Controlled Substance - Methamphetamine, a felony. He pleaded guilty\nto the charge, but entry of judgment was deferred. When applicant presented proof to\nthe court that he had completed a drug treatment program, his plea was withdrawn and\nthe charge was dismissed.\nApplicant falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SCA) he\nexecuted in October 1994 when he denied he had ever used an illegal drug.\nApplicant provided false material information in a signed, sworn statement he\ngave to the DoD in September 1995. Specifically, he lied when he stated his 1994 arrest\noccurred after he used methamphetamine for the first time, and when he stated his\ndenial of drug use on the aforementioned SCA was due to an oversight.\nApplicant falsified material facts on an SCA he executed in June 2005 when (1)\nin response to Question 24, he failed to disclose his 2003 drug-related charge, (2) in\nresponse to Question 27, he denied using any illegal drugs during the previous seven\nyears, and (3) in response to Question 28, he denied ever using illegal drugs while\nholding a security clearance.\nApplicant provided false material information to a DoD investigator in July 2006\nwhen he stated he began experimenting with methamphetamine in 1993 and quit it\n\u201ccold turkey\u201d in 1995.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\n\n3\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph b., \u201cdeliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\n\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug-related incidents were not alleged under this guideline.\n1\n4\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative,\u201d may be disqualifying. Both disqualifying conditions are applicable\nbecause applicant intentionally provided false, material information (1) on two SCAs, (2)\nin a signed, sworn statement he gave to a DoD investigator, and (3) to a DoD\ninvestigator during an interview.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 30 of the AG, and is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph c., an \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications were\nfelonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Accordingly, these two disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.1\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \n\n5\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant intentionally provided false\nmaterial information to the Government on four occasions from 1994 to July 2006 in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. 1001. Given the recency and frequency of his dishonest and\ncriminal conduct, there is no reason to believe he would tell the truth about his drug use\nif he were questioned about it today. Under the circumstances, applicant failed to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his history of dishonest and criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on August 31, 2007, detailing security concerns under \npersonal conduct and criminal conduct.  \n  \n \nOn November 12, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 31, 2008, I was assigned the case. On \nFebruary 11, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing which was \nheld on Febuary 19, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was kept \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional matters, and on February 26, 2008, \nadditional documents were received.

On March 4, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.c (1) of the SOR.

(Tr. 27) \n \n \nApplicant first smoked marijuana at age 14, his sophomore year of high school. \n(Tr. 50-51) At one point in his life, Applicant used marijuana on a daily to weekly basis. \n(Tr. 52) He attended high school classes \u201chigh\u201d a few times (Tr. 52) and went to his job \nat a restaurant \u201chigh.\u201d  In 1989, at age 19, Applicant smoked marijuana with his ex-\nfather-in-law. (Tr. 58)  At age 19 Applicant changed his life style. He stopped drinking \nevery night, quit smoking cigarettes, and lost 45 pounds when he started working out. \n(Tr. 49) From age 19 until 2003, Applicant used marijuana once every two or three \nyears. (Tr. 53)  In the summer or spring of 2001, Applicant smoked marijuana once by \nhimself.  Applicant has no desire to smoke marijuana. (Tr. 59, 60)  \n \nIn June 2003, Applicant completed on online job application with the FBI at a job \nfair. (Tr. 66) Applicant was told he failed to meet the requirements to work for the FBI \nwhen he answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question concerning illegal drug use. (Ex. 3) The online \napplication question asked if Applicant had used marijuana more than 15 times in his \nlife.  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nIn November or December 2003, five or six months after having had his applicant \nwith the FBI turned down due to his marijuana use, Applicant again used marijuana. \nThe use occurred in Applicant\u2019s home. The boyfriend of his wife\u2019s friend was a guest in \nhis home. The friend had brought some marijuana and left it when he left the home. \nApplicant, his wife, and friend indulged.  Applicant took two puffs of the marijuana. Other \nthan his wife, Applicant no longer associates with the other two individuals. (Tr. 25)  \n \n \nIn January 2005, a little over a year later, Applicant completed a Security \nClearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27, \nwhich asked about his use of illegal drugs since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, \nwhichever was shorter.  This would have been use since January 1998 when Applicant \nwas 27 years old.  Applicant had used marijuana once in the spring or summer of 2001, \nagain in November or December 2003, and may have used it one or two additional \ntimes during the period in questions because he was using it every two to three years.  \nApplicant does not remember why he checked \u201cno.\u201d (Tr. 20) Applicant asserts he had \nno intention of being deceptive or lying on the form. (Ex. B) \n \n \nOn December 12, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) about a number of issues including his marijuana \nusage. Applicant revealed his use in his home in November or December 2003. \nApplicant stated he did not use marijuana prior to or since that incident. (Ex 2)  \nApplicant was sent a copy of the report of investigation and made no corrections to it \nwhen he responded to interrogatories in July 2007. \n \nApplicant stated he does not currently use or experiment with illegal drugs and \ndid not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. Since 2003, he has been offered \nmarijuana a couple of times and turned down the offers.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying.  Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nUnder AG & 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d and & 16 (b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \n\n \n \n \n5\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d \n \nApplicant=s false answer on his SF 86 and his response during his OPM interview \nconcerning his history of marijuana use tends to show questionable judgment, \nunreliability, and a lack of trustworthiness. I find && 16 (a) and 16 (b) apply. \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to report his use of marijuana in response to \nquestion 27 on his security clearance application completed in January 2005.  Applicant \nhas offered no credible explanation for his failure to disclose his illegal drug usage on \nhis SF 86. His assertion that he was not being deceptive is unpersuasive.  Applicant \nhad knowingly used an illegal drug on multiple occasions.  That last use, occurring in \nNovember or December 2003, was slightly more than a year before completing the \nform.  Applicant should have been especially attuned to this question because his online \napplication to work for the FBI had been turned down when he indicated he had use \nmarijuana more than 15 times. His application to work for the FBI was rejected \napproximately six months before he completed his SF 86.  I find Applicant deliberately \nfalsified his answer to question 27 of the security clearance application.  \n \nDuring his December 2006 OPM interview, Applicant revealed his 2003 use of \nmarijuana. However, Applicant stated he had not used marijuana prior to the 2003 \nincident, which was a lie. Applicant was sent a copy of the report of investigation and \nmade no corrections to it when he responded to interrogatories in July 2007. I find \nApplicant provided deliberate false information during his OPM interview.  \n \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b617 provides \nconditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns, including AG \u00b6 17(a): \n\u201cif a person \u201cprovides the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  I find this \nmitigating factor does not apply.  Applicant has not met his burden of proving that he \nmade good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in his security clearance application \nand OPM interview, or that his efforts were prompt.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (f) provides mitigation where \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Applicant=s wrongful use of marijuana is \nsubstantiated by his admissions. The information was pertinent to a determination of his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find this mitigating factor does not apply.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The security clearance application in \nissue was executed in January 2005 and the OPM interview occurred in December \n2006, both of which are recent. The available evidence shows Applicant gave one false \nanswer on the security clearance application and gave false information almost two \nyears later during his OPM interview. This was not a single, isolated incident. I conclude \n\n \n \n \n6\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.  I also considered carefully the other \npotentially mitigating conditions and conclude they do not apply.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 31 (a) states it may be disqualifying where there \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d Similarly, AG \u00b6 31 (c) provides \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally      \nprosecuted or convicted\u201d may be disqualifying.  Paragraph 2 of the SOR alleges \nApplicant violated 18 U.S.C. ' 1001 by deliberately making a materially false statement \non his security clearance application.  For the reasons discussed above, I find Applicant \ndeliberately made materially false statements on his SF 86 in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' \n1001.   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct may be mitigated under certain \ncircumstances.  AG \u00b6 32 (a) provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns if \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The false statements at issue \nwere made on the security clearance application and during an OPM interview that are \npresently before us and are therefore recent. This mitigating condition does not apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32 (d), criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d Applicant=s evidence \ndoes not convince me that there is Aclear evidence of successful rehabilitation. This \npotentially mitigating condition does not apply. The other potentially mitigating \nconditions were carefully considered and do not apply.   \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nAppellant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nAppellant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62 (a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n \n \n7\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 37 years old and \nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions when responding to questions about his \nillegal drug history.  When he completed his SF 86, had Applicant been truthful about \nhis drug usage during the seven years prior to his completing his SF 86, it is unlikely an \nSOR would ever have been issued. The government expects and demands truthful \nresponses to questions even when those responses might be adverse or detrimental to \nthe individual seeking to obtain a clearance. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his \nsecurity worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On August 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline J for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 5, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 9, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 19, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 6, 2007, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2008. Based upon a\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegation 1.a., denied 1.b., only as to the\nplace in which he was arrested, and he did not give a response to 1.c. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 40 years old, and he is a high school graduate. Applicant is divorced,\nbut he still lives with and supports his ex-wife and their two children and his one\nstepchild. \nApplicant is employed as a custodian by a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in criminal acts.\n1.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 1987 and charged\nwith False ID to a Specific Police Officer and Assault with a Deadly Weapon on an\nOfficer. The charge of  False ID to a Specific Police Officer was dismissed. \nApplicant testified that when he was 18, he was driving a vehicle, when he was\nfollowed by an unmarked car that appeared to be trying to get him to pull over to the\nside.  Since he was not aware that it was a police vehicle, he did not stop until he was\npulled over by an identified police vehicle.  He thereafter explained that he had been\nunaware this unmarked car was a police vehicle. According to Applicant the case was\ndismissed and he was never required to got to court to resolve the case. At the hearing,\nDepartment Counsel confirmed that all charges were dismissed by the court. \n1.b.    The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 1988 and charged\nwith Unlawful Use of a Common Facility. He was sentenced to three years of\nconfinement, of which Applicant was incarcerated for a period of just less than two\nyears and placed on probation for one year. \nApplicant testified that this incident took place when he was 19 and living in a\nrented room in another individual\u2019s home and in another city, where planned to attend\ncollege. He had been in the home approximately 1 \u00bd months when it was raided by\npolice officers and all the residents of the home, including Applicant, were arrested.\nApplicant conceded that he knew drugs were being dealt from the home, but he\nadamantly denied ever taking part in the sale or use of drugs, while in the home or at\n\n3\nany other time in his life.  Applicant testified that he was offered a plea bargain through\nhis Public Defender, and because he was made aware that his sentence could have\nbeen far more severe if he challenged the case in court and was unsuccessful, he\ndecided to take the deal, even though he was not guilty. \n1.c. Since Applicant was sentenced to serve a term in prison of more than one\nyear, and since he actually was incarcerated for more than one year, 10 U.S.C. 986\napplies to this case, and Applicant is thus disqualified from receiving a security\nclearance. For reasons discussed below, I recommend further consideration of this case\nfor a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.\nApplicant testified that since he was released from jail when he was 22, he has\nnot been involved in any illegal conduct, nor have there been any allegations of illegal\nactivities charged against him.\nHe submitted an Employee Performance Evaluation from his current employer\nfor the period of May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2007 (Exhibit A). Applicant received an\nevaluation score of 91.50% out of 100%, and a rating of Outstanding in most categories.\nHe also submitted four character letters (Exhibit B). The letters were extremely positive\nin describing Applicant as a conscientious, hard working person of integrity and\nresponsibility.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following apply in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and (f) conviction in a\nFederal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced to\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result\nof that sentence for not less than a year. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; (c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense;\n\n5\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and, (e) potentially disqualifying\nconditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated unless, where\nmeritorious \ncircumstances \nexist, \nthe \nSecretaries \nof \nthe \nMilitary\nDepartments or designee; or the Directors of Washington Headquarters\nServices (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Security\nAgency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or\ndesignee, has granted a waiver. \nThe Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's conduct\nthat is the basis for allegation 1.b. of the SOR is criminal and did result in his receiving a\nterm of three years imprisonment, of which he served almost two years.  Based on the\nfollowing meritorious circumstances, I recommend a waiver in this case. Applicant\u2019s age\nat the time of the criminal incident was 19. No evidence has been introduced of any\nadditional criminal activity by Applicant since 1988. While the case itself can not be\nrelitigated, Applicant did testify credibly that he was not involved in drug use or sale\nduring this incident or at any other time in his life, and there has been no corroborating\nevidence of any other drug involvement. Finally, based on Applicant\u2019s Performance\nEvaluation and character letters, it appears that Applicant is now a productive member\nof society.  I find that Applicant has overcome the criminal conduct that occurred. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, I find that Applicant has overcome the criminal conduct allegations,\nand he would be eligible for a security clearance under the whole person concept.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. However, I\nrecommend consideration of this case for a meritorious waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to Egyptian parents. Her father is a \nprofessor at a Saudi Arabian university. She has relatives in Egypt. In 2000, she \nreturned to the U.S. to attend a university. While at university, she traveled to visit her \nfamily during summer and winter school breaks. She has recently married a U.S. citizen \nand purchased a U.S. home. She has substantially more connections to the United \nStates than to Egypt or Saudi Arabia.  \n \nI conclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \n \n \n \n1\nMay 19, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                          \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 25, 2007, detailing security \nconcerns under Foreign Influence.  \n \n \nOn November 16, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 25, 2008, I was assigned the case. On \nFebruary 11, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on \nFebruary 21, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf, as did two additional witnesses. \nApplicant submitted Exhibits A through D, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. On March 7, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nOn February 11, 2008, Notice of Hearing was mailed out for the hearing set on \nFebruary 21, 2008. At the hearing, Applicant was informed of her right under the \nDirective to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to \n15 days notice and requested that the hearing proceed without delay. (Tr. 9)  \n \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HEx) E I\u2500IX and SA 1-VI. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1. of the \nSOR except for \u00b6 1.b, which was denied because her sister was residing in Saudi \nArabia not Egypt and \u00b6 1.c, which was denied because it related to a sister and not to a \nbrother.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old software engineer / analyst who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since May 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Her \njob performance has been commendable to outstanding. (Ex. C and D) She is \ndependable, catches on quickly, has great tenacity, and is a valued team member. (Ex. \nD)  \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n \n \nIn 1983, Applicant was born in the United States, while her father was obtaining \nhis Ph.D. in chemistry at an American university. (Tr. 19) Her brother, who lives in the \nsame area as she does, was born in Michigan, while her father was working on a post \ndoctorate degree. (Tr. 21) Her brother, age 22, is currently a Ph.D. candidate having \ncompleted his undergraduate degree in pharmaceutical sciences. He lives on campus \nand on weekends, he spends time with Applicant. (Tr. 21, 33) \n \n \nFrom 1986 to 1989, Applicant\u2019s family resided in Kuwait where another sister \nwas born. This sister, who is an Egyptian citizen, attends the same school as \nApplicant\u2019s brother. Her sister is majoring in pharmaceutical sciences and hopes to \nobtain her Ph.D. (Tr. 21) Applicant sees her frequently. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family resided in Kuwait until the first Gulf War when they came to \nSouth Carolina. (Tr. 19) Applicant attended first grade in Kuwait. (Tr. 40) She left Kuwait \nwhen she was seven or eight. (Tr. 40) In 1992, the family moved to Saudi Arabia when \nher father obtained a job as a professor at a university. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister, now \nage 13, was born while the family lived in Saudi Arabia. Her youngest sister has four or \nfive years more before graduating from high school. (Tr.35-36) Her sister is very eager \nto move to the U.S.  \n \nHer parents have long term Saudi Arabian visas that allow them to reside and be \nemployed in Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s mother does not work outside of the home. When \nher father retires, her parents intend to move back to Egypt. Applicant has daily contact \nwith her mother by email, telephone, and instant messaging. (Tr. 23) She has weekly \ncontact with her father by instant messaging. (Ex. 2) Applicant\u2019s mother and younger \nsister visited her in the U.S. for a month, six weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 93)  \n \n \nMost of her parent\u2019s relatives live in Egypt. Applicant does not have contact with \nher father\u2019s side of the family. (Tr. 22) When in country, Applicant sees her grandmother \non her father\u2019s side. (Tr. 37) Her mother has two brothers and two sisters who are \ncitizens and residents of Egypt. Additionally, Applicant has eight cousins. (Tr. 37) Her \nuncles own an architectural consulting firm in Egypt. She talks with them five times a \nyear by telephone. She is in communication with other relatives in Egypt on a weekly \nbasis through instant messaging. Periodically, her uncles will call to check on her. (Tr. \n23) \n \n \nFrom September 1992 through July 2000, from age nine to seventeen, Applicant \nresided with her family at the university in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 40) She attended English \nschool where classes were taught in English. (Tr. 112) Up until the sixth grade, teaching \nwas from American books. (Tr. 112) Starting in sixth grade, Arabic was taken as a \nsecond language and school classes were taught using British books. Applicant was \ntaught the same information that children in the U.K. were taught. (Tr.113) Her exams \nwere British exams.  \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant returned to the U.S. to attend university where she \nobtained her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering. (Tr. 20, 44) Ever \n\n \n \n \n4\nsince 1992, when her family left the U.S. to go to Saudi Arabia, Applicant had wanted to \nreturn to the U.S. (Tr. 44) Between September 2000 and December 2005, when \nApplicant was attending a U.S. university, Applicant visited her family in Saudi Arabia \nduring the summer and during school break in December. (Tr. 23) All travel has been on \nher U.S. passport, which is the only passport she possesses. (Tr. 52) \n \nApplicant was last in Saudi Arabia in 2006 when she spent three months, from \nDecember 2005 until March 2006, with her parents and sister. (Tr. 39, 42)The trips \nlasted a month or less. Now that she is no longer a student, she visits her family once a \nyear, during the summer, when they are in Egypt. (Tr. 23) Applicant has no intention of \nvisiting Saudi Arabia again. Any future trips to visit family will be to Egypt.  \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant traveled to Egypt for three weeks to visit her uncles, aunt, \nand cousins. As a university professor, her father has breaks during the summer, which \nis when her parents and sister travel to Egypt. (Tr. 24) In 2006, she lived with her \nparents who have a residence in Cairo. From mid-June 2007 to mid-July 2007, \nApplicant last visited Egypt when she visited family and married. \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant filed for her parents to obtain green cards. Before \napplying for a green card for a parent an individual must be 21 years old and a $2,500 \nfee per person must be submitted at the time of the application. (Tr. 32, 112) When \nApplicant turned 21 she and her brother were both in college and her parent\u2019s finances \npreventing the initiation of the process at that time. (Tr. 112)  \n \n \nApplicant has no financial or business interests in any foreign country. (Tr. 47) \nApplicant\u2019s only connection to Saudi Arabia is that her father works there. (Tr. 28)  \n \n \nApplicant met her husband when they were attending university. (Tr. 29) He grew \nup in Kansas and his family all lives in Kansas. His father is a doctor and his mother \ndoes not work outside the home. (Tr. 82) Her husband has his master\u2019s degree and is \ncompleting his Ph.D. (Tr. 48) They married in July 2007 in Egypt. In February 2007, she \nand her husband purchased their home for $188,000. (Ex. A) She has $8,188 in a 401 \n(k) retirement account, $7,000 in her checking account, and a substantial amount in her \nsavings account. (Ex. B, Tr. 26, 47) She is a registered voter in the U.S. (Tr. 62) She \nintends to make the U.S. her permanent home. (Tr. 45)  \n \n \nEven though the government of Egypt treats children born to Egyptian father\u2019s as \nEgyptian, Applicant would have to apply for a visa if she stayed in Egypt more than six \nmonths. (Tr. 51) When she turned 21, she could have applied for Egyptian citizenship, \nbut chose not to. (Tr. 51) Applicant would not want to live in Egypt permanently for it is \ntoo complicated and she certainly does not wish to live in Saudi Arabia. She enjoys her \nlife in the U.S. more. (Tr. 59)  \n \nEgypt \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Egypt is a republic with a strong \nexecutive. The United States and Egypt enjoy a strong and friendly relationship based \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \non shared mutual interests in Middle East peace and stability, strengthening trade \nrelations, and promoting regional security.2 The threat of terrorism in Egypt remains \nhigh and transnational terrorist groups and local terrorist groups pose threats in Egypt \ndespite Egypt\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists and \u201cZero tolerance\u201d policy on \nextremism.3 In 2003, Egypt discovered and disrupted a terrorist plot against U.S. \ninterests.4 Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt suffered a series of deadly, coordinated \nterrorist bombings, which cause many deaths and hundreds of injuries, including U.S. \ncitizens.5 \u201cAlthough the Egyptian government took measures against the perpetrators of \nthe 2004 and 2005 attacks, a 2006 bombing reflects a persistent, indigenous threat of \nterror activities.6 \n \nTerrorists use overt, covert, and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine \nU.S. national security interests. Terrorist organizations currently target the U.S. for \nintelligence collection through human espionage and other means.7 Terrorist groups \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  \n \nThe State Department notes the Egypt\u2019s human rights record is poor and serious \nabuses continue in many areas.8 Problems include: restriction of freedom of speech, \npress, assembly, and association, denial of fair trial, lack of due process, limitations on \nthe right of citizens to change their government, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, \npoor prison conditions, political prisoners and detainees, torture, as well as executive \nbranch limitation on an independent judiciary.9 Torture in Egyptian detention centers is \npervasive.10  \n \nOpposition parties continue to lodge credible complaints about election \nmanipulation by the government even though recent elections were more transparent \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Egypt, March 2007.

The central institution of \nthe Saudi Arabian government is the monarchy.14 There are no political parties or \nnational elections.15 There is no right to peaceful change of the government. The \nfollowing human rights problems exist: significant restriction of civil liberties \u2500 freedoms \nof speech, press, assembly, association, and movement; arbitrary arrest and detention, \nsometimes incommunicado; infliction of severe pain by judicially sanctioned corporal \npunishment; beatings and other abuses; inadequate conditions at prison and detention \ncenters; and arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence.16 \n \nThere is a widespread perception of serious corruption and a lack of government \ntransparency, as well as legal and societal discrimination and violence against \nwomen.17 Discrimination is faced by other religious, ethnic, and minority groups. There \nare strict limitations on workers rights, especially for foreign workers. \n \nThe religious police (Mutawwa\u2019in) (MOI) harass, abuse, and detain citizens and \nforeigners.18 The government sentences criminals to punishments according to its \ninterpretation of Shari\u2019a (Islamic religious law). Corporal punishments provided by law \ninclude public executions by beheading, amputations, lashings, and other measures \ndeemed appropriate by the judicial authorities. The Basic Law guarantees the \ninviolability of homes and the privacy of correspondence.19 However, custom officials \nroutinely open mail searching for contraband.  \n \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 U.S Department of Sate, Consular Information Sheet \u2013 Egypt, June 20, 2007.

Following September 11, 2001, relations \nbetween Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have been strained. Fifteen of the suicide bombers \nin the terrorist attacks were Saudi citizens. In May 2003, suicide bombers killed 35 \npeople, including nine Americans, in attacks in the capital. In November 2003, a terrorist \nattack on a housing compound left 18 dead and more than 100 injured. In June 2004, \nterrorists killed three Americans. In December 2004, terrorist attacks on the U.S. \nConsulate killed five.  \n \nThe Department of State has issued a travel warning for Saudi Arabia due to \nconcerns about possible terrorist activity directed at American citizens and U.S. \ninterests.20 Terrorists continue to target housing compounds and other establishments \nwhere westerners may be located.  \n \nThe Saudi government has moved to monitor and enforce its anti-money \nlaundering and terrorist finance laws, regulations, and guidelines.21 The Saudi \ngovernment has permitted or encouraged fund-raising in Saudi Arabia by charitable \nIslamic groups and foundations linked to Al-Qaeda.22 Saudi Arabia has been unwilling \nto publically disseminate statistics regarding money laundering prosecutions. Saudi \nArabia recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate \nrepresentative of the Pales\n23\n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nUnder AG & 6, foreign contacts and interests, may be a security concern  \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions. Conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying are listed under AG & 7. \nAG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \n\n \n \n \n9\ncoercion.\u201d and AG & 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are Egyptian citizens. Applicant\u2019s father is a professor \nteaching at a Saudi Arabian university. Her mother does not work outside the home. \nApplicant\u2019s younger sister, age 13, lives with her parents. Applicant has frequent contact \nwith her mother. While attending university in the United States, Applicant visited her \nparents during summer and winter breaks from classes. Traveling home during school \nbreaks is what students do. All travel was on her U.S. passport, which is the only \npassport she possesses. Applicant\u2019s loyalty is to the U.S. rather than Saudi Arabia or \nEgypt and her only connection with the country is her father\u2019s teaching position there. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d and AG \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s parents and foreign \nrelatives.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister attend university in the U.S., a short distance from \nwhere Applicant lives with her husband. She sees them frequently. Her brother was \nborn in Michigan and her sister was born in Kuwait. Applicant\u2019s younger sister is most \nanxious to come to the U.S. and will do so when she finishes high school. Applicant has \nrecently started the process of obtaining green cards for her parents. Applicant was \nunable to initiate the process before turning 21 and the financial aspect of paying the \napplication fee prevented earlier action.  \n \nApplicant has relatives in Egypt with whom she has regular contact. In 2007, \nwhen she married a U.S. citizen, the marriage took place in Egypt. Applicant\u2019s uncles \nrun an architectural design business and, as uncles are want to do, maintain regular \ncontact with Applicant to check up on her. The contact with her mother and her mother\u2019s \nrelatives in Egypt is frequent. Her contact with her father\u2019s relatives in Egypt is not. \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who reside in Egypt, Applicant, her parents, and \nrelatives are in no greater danger than any other individual living and working there. \n \nApplicant has no desire to live permanently in Egypt. She enjoys her life in the \nU.S. more. If she stays in Egypt for more than six months she must apply for a visa. \nWhen she turned 21, she could have applied for Egyptian citizenship, but chose not to. \nShe has made her chose to make her life with her new husband in the U.S. They have \npurchased a home together and all her finances are in the U.S.  \n \n\n \n \n \n10\n \nThere is little likelihood Applicant has any conflict of interest, but if she did it is \nclear, due to her loyalty to the U.S. and the likely minimal possibility of the conflict; she \nwould resolve it in favor of the U.S.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Egypt and her parents living \nin Saudi Arabia and the heavy burden an Applicant carries when she has family \nmembers in a foreign country. As indicated in the statement of facts, there are many \nother countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that weigh \ntowards granting a clearance. Applicant has close ties to the United States. Her closest \nfamily member is her husband, a U.S. citizen born and raised in the U.S., who lives with \nher. Additionally, her brother and sister are nearby, attending a U.S. university. Because \nher husband and siblings live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by a foreign power, except possibly indirectly through relatives, who still live \nin Egypt or Saudi Arabia.  \n \nApplicant was born in the United States, spent her formative years living abroad \nattending British schools, and returned to the U.S. to attend university. She has lived in \nthe U.S. since 2000. Applicant and her husband purchased a home in February 2007. \nAlthough her parents live in Saudi Arabia and she has relatives living in Egypt and she \nhas frequent telephone and electronic contact with them, she has no desire to ever live \npermanently in either country. She may visit relatives in Egypt in the future, but her trips \nwill never be as frequent as when she was a college student visiting her parents during \nsummer and winter breaks from classes. Her marriage to a U.S. citizen reinforces the \ndecision that her life is now in the U.S. \n \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis in a Guideline B case should include \u201cthe totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstance[s] (including the realistic potential for \n\n \n \n \n11\nexploitation).\u201d Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation is low. I base this finding on her \ncredible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe she would compromise national \nsecurity, or otherwise comply with any threats or pressure emanating from Saudi Arabia \nor Egypt. Although there is a significant risk of terrorism in both countries she has such \ndeep loyalties to the U.S. and U.S. family members, she would resolve those pressures \nin favor of the U.S. interest. See AG \u00b6 8(b). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-i:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The \nGuideline K security concerns are mitigated, but the Guideline E and F concerns are not \nmitigated.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 26, 2006. On \nFebruary 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines K, E, and F. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nJanuary 14, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 12, 2009; answered it on March 6, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on March 9, 2009. DOHA sent Applicant an amendment to the SOR on August \n9, 2010, adding three allegations under Guideline E. Applicant answered the \namendment to the SOR in an undated document.1 Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on August 12, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on August 17, 2010. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 9, 2010, scheduling it for September \n28, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nDuring Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination, Applicant indicated that she did \nnot desire to continue with the hearing. I recessed the hearing to allow Applicant to \ndecide whether she desired to withdraw her request for a hearing. (Tr. I at 81-83.2) The \ntranscript of this portion of the hearing was received on October 4, 2010. \n \n \nOn October 14, 2010, Applicant informed Department Counsel that she desired \nto continue with the hearing, and that she intended to retain a lawyer. On October 28, \n2010, DOHA issued a second notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing to continue on \nNovember 22, 2010. I reconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant appeared and \nstated that she had decided to continue representing herself. (Tr. II at 5.) \n \nAfter Department Counsel completed her cross-examination, Applicant presented \nthe testimony of one witness and submitted AX E through J, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I kept the record open until December 1, 2010, to enable Applicant to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence, and she timely submitted AX K, which was \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX K are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. The transcript of the second day of the \nhearing was received on December 1, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.c, \n3.f, 3.g, 3.h-3.m, and 3.o-3.t. She denied all the remaining allegations in the SOR and \nthe amendment to the SOR. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, currently working as \na deployment coordinator. (Tr. I at 44.) She has worked for her current employer since \n                                                          \n1 The page numbering on the amendment to the SOR indicates that it consists of three pages, but only \ntwo pages were in the file. The copy in the file was Applicant\u2019s facsimile transmission of her answer, and \nher facsimile cover sheet indicates that only two pages were transmitted. The third page is included as \nthe last page of GX 10.  \n \n2 Separate transcripts were prepared for each day of the hearing. The transcript of the proceedings on \nSeptember 28, 2010 is cited in this decision as Tr. I. The transcript of the proceedings on November 22, \n2010 is cited as Tr. II. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nJuly 2005. Her SCA reflects that she has held a security clearance since April 2002. \n(GX 1 at 8.) She testified she has held a security clearance since she was 18 years old. \n(Tr. I at 47.) She previously worked for other federal contractors from August 1997 to \nJuly 2005. She was a federal employee from 1988 to August 1997.  \n \n \nApplicant married in July 1993 and divorced in October 2000. She has a 16-year-\nold daughter who lives with the daughter\u2019s father. Applicant and her daughter\u2019s father \nhave an informal agreement that Applicant will pay for their daughter\u2019s education. \n \n \nIn March 1999, while working for a previous employer, Applicant was appointed \nas the custodian for her employer\u2019s communications security (COMSEC) account. She \ncompleted the COMSEC Managers Course in 1999 and attended annual COMSEC \nManagers Seminars. In August or September 2004, her supervisor began shifting some \nof her responsibilities to others because he believed she was being overworked with too \nmany duties. In April 2005, the account was audited in preparation for a change of \ncustodians. The audit revealed that (1) COMSEC inventories for 2000, 2002, 2003, and \n2004 were not completed and forwarded as required; (2) COMSEC keying material was \nreported as being destroyed but was still on hand; (3) COMSEC keying material was \nmissing; (4) superseded COMSEC keying material was not destroyed as required; (5) \nCOMSEC keying material was improperly stored; and (6) COMSEC devices were not \nproperly safeguarded. (GX 5; GX 6.) The last finding included an incident where she \nstored classified COMSEC keying material in her desk drawer rather than a classified \nsafe. As a result of these discrepancies, Applicant was suspended for one week without \npay. These findings are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and were admitted by Applicant in her \nanswer.  \n \nA report of investigation (ROI)3 by the security manager reflects that during the \ninvestigation Applicant was asked if she had sufficient time and resources to perform \nher duties, and she responded, \u201cNo, I was swamped with work and training new hires, \nbut ultimately knew that I was responsible for maintaining the account.\u201d (GX 6 at 8.) The \nROI also reflects that the new custodian and another employee conducted the change-\nof-custodian inventory without Applicant\u2019s participation due to \u201cmanagement interest\u201d in \ncompleting the inventory quickly. (GX 6 at 5.) The applicable COMSEC Manual requires \nthat a newly appointed custodian and the departing custodian conduct an inventory of \nall COMSEC material held by the account. The ROI does not reflect whether Applicant \nwas invited or directed to participate in the inventory.  \n \n \nOn April 25, 2008, Applicant submitted an affidavit to a security investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in connection with her application to \ncontinue her clearance. She stated that her duties required a \u201cgeneral audit\u201d of all \nCOMSEC equipment every six months and an annual \u201cfull audit\u201d to be submitted to the \nsupervising federal agency. When she was scheduled for reassignment in late 2004 or \n                                                          \n3  The ROI is not covered by the authentication requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, because it was not a \n\u201cDoD personnel background report of investigation\u201d and was not \u201cfurnished by an investigative agency.\u201d \nThe investigation was conducted by the federal contractor\u2019s employees regarding a suspected security \nviolation. Applicant did not object to admission of the ROI. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nearly 2005, two audits that should have been completed over an approximate nine-\nmonth period (in 2003-04) had not been done, and the supervising federal agency had \nsent her notice that the required audits had not been received. When she received the \nnotice of missing inventories, she notified the supervising agency of the impending \nchange of custodians.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2008 affidavit, she stated that she intended to have her \nsupervisor, who was the assistant custodian, assist with the required audits, but she \nconducted the audit alone because her supervisor was involved in personal matters that \nleft insufficient time to participate in the audit. Applicant stated that she conducted the \naudit, discovered that some property was missing, and reported her discovery to her \nsupervisor and her security manager. Applicant used the term \u201caudit\u201d instead of \n\u201cinventory,\u201d but it is clear that she was talking about an inventory of COMSEC material. \nApplicant\u2019s affidavit does not state whether she conducted a \u201cgeneral\u201d semi-annual \naudit, the annual \u201cfull\u201d audit required by the supervising agency, or the required change-\nof-custodian inventory. (GX 4 at 1-2.)  \n \nThe amended SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant falsified her affidavit by stating \nthat she conducted the change-of-custodian inventory. Applicant denied this allegation \nin her answer to the Amended SOR. At the hearing, she testified that she could not \nexplain the apparent discrepancy because it was so long ago, but she remembered \nspecifically that she did her own inventory. (Tr. II at 44-45.) \n \n \nThe ROI also found that the required inventories were not completed and \nsubmitted in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004. The amended SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that \nApplicant falsified her affidavit of April 25, 2008, by stating that she had not completed \nthe two inventories required in a nine-month period in 2004-05, but failing to disclose \nthat the required inventories were not conducted in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004. \nApplicant denied this allegation in her answer to the Amended SOR.  \n \n \nFinally, the ROI quoted Applicant as stating, \u201cThe [supervising agency] did \nrequest an annual inventory every year and this was conducted through 2003 and the \nresults were sent to the [supervising agency].\u201d The report of investigation also states \nthat an inventory dated May 19, 2003, was found in the supervising agency\u2019s records \nbut it was not signed by Applicant or the assistant custodian. (GX 6 at 4, 8.) The \namended SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant made false statements during the \ninvestigation when she stated that she completed the required inventories every year \nthrough 2003. Applicant denied this allegation in her answer to the amended SOR. At \nthe hearing, she testified that she denied all three allegations of falsification because \nshe could not remember the dates of the various inventories because of the passage of \ntime. (Tr. II at 46.) \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.i and \n3.t were incurred and became delinquent between 2001 and 2004. The remaining debts \nbecame delinquent on or before September 2007.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her divorce in October 2000 that led \nto alcohol abuse and involvement in an abusive relationship. (GX 2 at 13.) She \nterminated the abusive relationship in August 2001. After a conviction for driving under \nthe influence in May 2005 and completion of court-ordered counseling, she reduced her \nconsumption to one or two beers once or twice a month. (GX 2 at 4-7; Tr. II at 50-51.) \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount\nAnswer \nStatus \nEvidence \n3.a \nJudgment (rent) \n$4,022 \nDeny \nSatisfied by wage \ngarnishment; not on \ncurrent credit report \nGX 7 at 1;  \nGX 8 at 1;  \nTr.

She has been repaying her parents monthly \nand still owes them about $2,400. (Tr. I at 49-50.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d and 3.f were for the \nsame debt. The two judgments were obtained by the same creditor, but the amounts \nare significantly different, and they were obtained on different dates, one in October \n2003 and one in July 2004. Applicant did not present any documentation to support her \ntestimony. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified that he and Applicant\u2019s mother had helped her several \ntimes by loaning her money, but they always made it clear that it was a loan and they \nexpected to be repaid. In addition, they required that she provide them with a financial \nanalysis and a financial plan. (Tr. II at 16-18.) He testified that they loaned Applicant \nmoney about three times in the last ten years, usually in amounts around $2,000 or \n$3,000. Applicant has always made an effort to repay her parents, but they have not \nbeen strict in enforcing a payment schedule. (Tr. II at 22-26.) Applicant\u2019s father \nunderstands the relationship between a security clearance and financial stability, having \nheld a security clearance for 20 years in the Navy and another ten years as a \ncontractor. (Tr. II at 26.) \n \nApplicant presented a written budget reflecting net monthly pay of $4,060, fixed \nmonthly expenses of $3,860, and a remainder of $320. Her budget includes monthly \nloan repayments of $400 to her parents, $100 monthly savings for her daughter, and \nmonthly payments of $250 on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.q. It does not reflect \npayments on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.d, 3.f-3.p, and 3.r-3.t. (AX J.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for 2007, 2008, and 2009 rated her in the top \ncategory. (AX A, B, and C.) Her supervisor for the past three years described her duties \nas requiring the ability to \u201cmultitask, exercise sound judgment, and make proper \ndecisions routinely, without direct supervision.\u201d Her supervisor regards her as \n\u201ccompletely trustworthy.\u201d She has \u201cthe utmost confidence in [Applicant\u2019s] loyalty, \nhonesty, and capability.\u201d (AX E.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor in her former job believes that she fully appreciated the \nseriousness of her mistakes that led to her disciplinary action, has expressed genuine \nregret for them, and has matured and learned from her experience. (AX F.) The director \nof security at the time of Applicant\u2019s security violations believes that she \u201cwas asked to \nassume several new roles which stretched her abilities as a security professional.\u201d He \ndescribes her as genuinely remorseful, and he recommends that her security clearance \nbe continued. (AX G.) \n \nA project manager for whom Applicant served as a facility security officer for six \nyears found her performance to be outstanding. He states that her professionalism and \nintegrity are beyond reproach. (AX H.) \n \nA coworker for five years describes Applicant as exceptionally caring, devoted, \nand energetic. She also describes Applicant as a \u201cwonderful humanitarian\u201d who \nvolunteers to work at military hospitals with wounded soldiers, where she demonstrates \nfearlessness and compassion in situations where others are not strong enough to deal \nwith the soldiers\u2019 tragedies. (AX I.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n7 \n \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the numerous security violations that were found during the \nchange-of-custodian inventory of Applicant\u2019s COMSEC account. The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with \nrules and regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions, \ncorroborated by her former employer\u2019s ROI, establish two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 34(b) (\u201ccollecting or storing classified or other protected information \nat home or in any other unauthorized location\u201d) and AG 34(g) (\u201cany failure to comply \nwith rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information\u201d). AG 34(h) \n(\u201cnegligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by management\u201d) is \nnot established because there is no evidence that Applicant was counseled about her \nsecurity habits.  \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b) and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \n \nSecurity violations are one of the strongest reasons for denying or revoking \naccess to classified information. Once a security violation is established, an applicant \nhas a heavy burden of demonstrating that he or she should be entrusted with classified \ninformation. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security \nprogram, an administrative judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict \nscrutiny. ISCR Case No. 03-02688 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright \nline@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based \non a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of the COMSEC account occurred more than five years \nago. She retained her security clearance and has not been cited for a security violation \nsince she began working for her current employer in July 2005. Her performance \n\n \n9 \n \n \nappraisals for the past three years have been outstanding, and her supervisor trusts her \ncompletely. I conclude that the first prong of AG \u00b6 35(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is established.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of the COMSEC account spanned several years and \ninvolved multiple derelictions. Therefore, I conclude that the second prong of AG \u00b6 35(a) \n(\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established.  \n \nApplicant held a security clearance for many years before her security violations \nduring 2000-2005. Her violations coincided with the breakup of her marriage, her \ninvolvement in an abusive relationship, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of \ninvolvement by her supervisor, and a stressful environment in which she was \noverworked. The record reflects that her personal life is no longer in turmoil, she has \nmoderated her alcohol consumption, and her work environment is less stressful. \nAccordingly, I conclude that the third prong of AG \u00b6 35(a) (\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d) is \nestablished.  \n \nIn light of all the above circumstances, Applicant\u2019s past security violations do not \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Accordingly, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 35(a) is established. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates \na positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(b). The \nrecord does not reflect \u201ccounseling\u201d or remedial training, but it does reflect disciplinary \naction and Applicant\u2019s remorse and acceptance of responsibility for her derelictions. Her \nperformance appraisals, the endorsements by former and current supervisors, and her \ntestimony and demeanor at the hearing demonstrated a positive attitude toward security \nresponsibilities. I conclude that the second prong AG \u00b6 35(b) (\u201cpositive attitude\u201d) is \nestablished. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe security \nviolations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(c). I conclude that this \nmitigating condition is not established because the record reflects that Applicant \nreceived proper training and was aware of her responsibilities.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s security violations as personal conduct. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d allege that Applicant falsified material information during her \nemployer\u2019s investigation into her management of the COMSEC account and during her \nOPM background investigation. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 \nas follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving them. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not \nprove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant falsely stated in an affidavit given to an OPM \nsecurity investigator in April 2008 that she conducted an inventory in February 2005, \nwhen in fact the inventory was conducted by two of her colleagues. This allegation is \nnot supported by substantial evidence. In her affidavit, Applicant stated that she knew \nthat two required inventories had not been completed in the preceding nine months, and \nthat she conducted an inventory alone because her supervisor was not available to \nassist her. Applicant was knowledgeable about the inventory requirements and would \nhave known that the change-of-custodian inventory should be conducted jointly by the \noutgoing custodian and incoming custodian. Applicant\u2019s affidavit did not state that she \nconducted the change-of-custodian inventory. A fair reading of her affidavit is that she \nconducted one of the missing semi-annual inventories, not the change-of-custodian \ninventory. As such, her affidavit is not inconsistent with her former employer\u2019s ROI. I \nconclude that SOR \u00b6 1.b is not supported by substantial evidence. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant told an OPM investigator that she did not \nconduct the inventories required during the a nine-month period in 2004-2005, but that \nshe falsified material information by failing to disclose that she had not conducted the \nrequired inventories in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant \nfalsely stated to her employer\u2019s investigators that she had completed the required \ninventories through 2003. These two allegations are supported by her former \nemployer\u2019s ROI, showing that she did not complete the required inventories in 2000 and \n2002. Applicant\u2019s falsifications establish AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d). \n \nThe disqualifying condition relevant to the alleged security violations cross-\nalleged under this guideline is AG \u00b6 16(c): \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by Applicant\u2019s security violations and her falsifications about \nher security violations during her employer\u2019s investigation 2005 and her OPM \nbackground investigation in April 2008.  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers during a security \ninvestigation may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established because there is no \nevidence that Applicant attempted to correct her OPM affidavit or her statements to her \nformer employer\u2019s security investigators. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). For the \nreasons stated in the above discussion of Guideline K, I conclude that this mitigating \ncondition is established for the security violations cross-alleged under this guideline. \nHowever, it is not established for Applicant\u2019s false statements. While overwork, lack of \nsupervisory support, turmoil in her personal life, and negligence were significant factors \ncausing her security violations, those factors do not justify intentional falsification. Her \nOPM affidavit was recent, having been submitted more than three years after her \nsecurity violations and in connection with her current application to continue her \nclearance.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). This mitigating condition is partly established \nfor Applicant\u2019s security violations, but not for her falsifications. Applicant has not \nobtained counseling, but she has acknowledged and accepted responsibility for her \nsecurity violations. She has terminated the abusive relationship and moderated her \nconsumption of alcohol. However, she has not acknowledged her falsifications, and she \nhas not demonstrated that the factors that caused her to provide false and misleading \ninformation about her security violations have been alleviated. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts, of which only three have been resolved. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n12 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history establishes three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d);  AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d). \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing, \nnumerous, and not the product of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marital breakup in 2000 triggered a period of emotional turmoil, \nalcohol abuse, and financial mismanagement. However, she has not acted responsibly \ndespite continuous employment and financial support from her parents. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence that Applicant has \nsought or received counseling and her financial problems are not under control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only \nestablish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement \nthe plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be \npaid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nThe judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a was satisfied by involuntary wage \ngarnishment and not by Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts. The evidence reflects that the \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.e has been satisfied, and Applicant is making payments \non the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.q. She has not resolved the remaining debts alleged in \nthe SOR and has no plan for doing so. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.q, but not for the other delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nhas not disputed any of the debts. She testified that the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n3.d and 3.f were duplicates. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under \nthe same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged \ntwice). However, she provided no documentation to show that the two judgments were \nfor the same debt. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines K, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is mature, intelligent, and hard working. She has worked as a \nGovernment employee or Government contractor and held a security clearance for all of \nher adult life. She has earned the respect of her supervisors in spite of her security \nviolations five years ago. She has not, however, learned how to manage her personal \n\n \n14 \n \n \nfinances, and her falsifications during her former employer\u2019s investigation in 2005 and in \nher OPM affidavit in April 2008 raise doubts about her current trustworthiness and \nreliability. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K, E, \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on her handling of protected \ninformation, but she has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her lack of candor \nduring two security investigations and her continuing financial problems. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.f-3.p: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.r-3.t: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Department Counsel\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 8(b) is unsupported by the record evidence and is\ntherefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsupported by the record evidence and it therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nFinding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant was born in Iran and\nmoved to the United States with his father when Applicant was five years of age and has lived in the\nUnited States ever since.  Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in 1996.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife was also born in Iran.  She came to the United States in 2000 and became a naturalized United\nStates citizen in 2004.  They have no children.\nThe Judge took administrative notice of the hostile nature of the relationship between the\nUnited States and Iran, including the fact that Iran \u201cis considered one of the most dangerous\nadversaries to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Decision at 4.  The Judge\u2019s decision includes the\nfollowing statement: \u201cThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are\nnot limited to the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of mass\ndestruction, (2) its sponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs\nof Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and (5) its human\nrights violation against its own people.\u201d  Id.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\n\nApplicant testified: 1) to his continuing possession of an Iranian ID card, which he is willing to surrender; 2)\n1\nto his family\u2019s attempts to secure return of confiscated property in Iran; and 3) to his apprehensiveness about traveling\nto Iran at the time of the other matters to which he testified.  \n3\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this appeal.  In arguing the issues on appeal, Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision does not take into account significant contrary record evidence.  The Board will address this\ncontention below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).\n\u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant,\ndeny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3. \nThe Judge discussed the security concerns raised in this case under Guideline B.  Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E2.6 and 2.7.  However, the Judge found these concerns mitigated under \u00b6 8(b).  In applying \u00b6\n8(b), the Judge overlooked significant record evidence.  The Judge noted the fact that Applicant has\nbeen in the United States since he was five years old and has strong ties to this country.  In his\napplication of Guideline B, the Judge overlooked record evidence regarding the close relationship\nof Applicant and his wife with Applicant\u2019s mother- and father-in-law, who live in Iran.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife speaks to her parents every day or every other day.  Applicant\u2019s in-laws are adherents of the\nBaha\u2019i faith.  Applicant testified that members of that religion are denied rights and are often\nmistreated in Iran.  Applicant and his wife have applied for permission for her parents to enter the\nUnited States, but they are still in Iran.  Applicant\u2019s wife testified that her parents have some\nknowledge that Applicant\u2019s job is in some way connected with the United States, although it is not\nclear how much they know about its exact nature.  The Judge\u2019s failure to discuss explicitly these and\nother facts  raises the question of whether the Judge failed to take them into account, failed to\n1\nunderstand their significance, or engaged in an arbitrary and capricious analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-00318 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004).  \nThe Judge gave significant weight to Applicant\u2019s testimony that he would do nothing to assist\nhis in-laws if the Iranian government threatened or pressured them.  The Board has stated that such\ntestimony, standing alone, is of limited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has\n\n4\nacted in a similar manner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a\nprevious track record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of\ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national\nsecurity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25202 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 22, 2008). \nWhile the Judge took administrative notice of the nature of the Iranian government, he gave\nlittle consideration to the nature of that government in reaching his conclusions, particularly in light\nof the heightened risk to Applicant\u2019s in-laws in this case.  Cf. ISCR Case No. 05-00939 at 5 (Oct.\n3, 2007).   \nThe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is based on Applicant\u2019s close ties to the United States,\nas discussed in his application of mitigation above.  Again, the Judge does not take into account\ncontrary evidence such as the heightened risk to Applicant\u2019s in-laws set out above, and his analysis\nis therefore, not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Perry, Esquire\nFebruary 7, 2007\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 3,\n2006. On July 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C and B\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 12, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nNovember 13, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 4, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and had four additional witnesses testify. Through counsel, he also\nsubmitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\n\n2\nhearing (Tr.) on January 31, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the country of Iran. The request and the attached documents\nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 3. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b., 2.a., and 2.b., with\nexplanations. He denied 1.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, the testimony of Applicant and the other\nwitnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings\nof fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old and was born in Iran in 1974. He moved to the United\nStates in 1979, with his father and his grandmother, and he has lived in the U.S. since\nthat time.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1996.  Applicant received a\nBachelor of Science degree in 1995, and a Masters of Science degree in 1997, from a\nUnited States university. Applicant is married, and his wife, who was also born in Iran,\ncame to the United States in 2000, and became a United States citizen in 2004.\nApplicant and his wife do not have any children.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Iran\nand the United States. Applicant contends that he has not engaged in any of the\nresponsibilities or duties of being a Iranian citizen, nor has he been to Iran since he left\nwhen he was five years old. He has also not considered himself to be an Iranian citizen\nor a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  The only potential exercise of Iranian\ncitizenship is the application for and receipt of an Iranian passport, after he became a\nUnited States citizen, which is alleged in the SOR as 1.b., and which will be reviewed\nbelow. \n1.b. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant applied for and was issued an Iranian\npassport, on May 12, 2004, even though he had become a United States citizen on\nSeptember 5, 1996, and received a United States passport on September 25, 2000. His\nIranian passport is not scheduled to expire until June 12, 2009. \n\n3\nApplicant testified that he and his wife had contemplated traveling to Iran to see\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law. They learned that they could not enter Iran with United States\npassports, since they both were born in Iran. However, neither Applicant nor his wife,\never traveled to Iran as they became concerned that as members of the Baha\u2019i faith\nthey may not be treated well in Iran. They also never used their Iranian passports. \nWhen Applicant became aware of the concerns of the U.S. Government with his\nretaining a foreign passport, both he and his wife surrendered their passports to the\nFacility Security Officer (FSO) of his employer, who destroyed both passports. Applicant\nsubmitted a letter from the FSO (Exhibit E), who verified that she had destroyed both\nIranian passports. The FSO also testified at the hearing, and she reiterated that she had\nshredded both passports, and placed them in her company\u2019s safe. \nI can not find that Applicant\u2019s application and receipt of his Iranian passport, in\nthe way described above, indicated a preference for another county over the United\nSates or exhibited the exercise of dual citizenship with Iran and the U.S.\nFinally, while Applicant testified that he does not consider himself a citizen of Iran\nas he has lived in the United States since he was five, and he has become a U.S.\ncitizen, he did submit into evidence a letter that he sent on October 15, 2007, to the\nEmbassy of Pakistan, Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran, (Exhibit B) in\nwhich he stated,  \u201cI renounce and disavow any claim to Iranian citizenship.\u201d \nWhen he was questioned as to what he would do if a representative of a terrorist\ngroup in Iran threatened his family in Iran if he did not cooperate with them, he testified,\n\u201cWell obviously, I wouldn\u2019t turn over any information whatsoever, and I would just notify\nthe authorities.\u201d (Tr at 78). \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n2.a. Applicant's mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant testified that his\nfather and mother were divorced when he was one year of age. Since that time he\nnever lived with her, growing up instead with his father and grandmother. \nApplicant saw his mother on one occasion, when he was 14 and his mother\ncame to the United States. He has not seen her since then. He contacted her\napproximately five years ago as he was in the process of getting married, and according\nto his faith he is strongly encouraged to get approval from each biological parent. After\nthat his contact became a little more frequent, but in the last few years his contact is\nextremely sporadic. His mother has telephoned him, but according to the testimony of\nApplicant and his wife, he usually does not return calls to her.  He indicated that he now\nhas no interest in having contact with her, since he has no affection for her.\n\n4\n2.b. Applicant's father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Iran. However, Applicant has averred that since they are members of the\nBaha\u2019i faith, they are not allowed to hold government jobs, teach school or attend\ncollege in Iran.\nTo ensure that their presence in Iran will not remain a security risk, Applicant has\nconvinced his parents-in-law to emigrate from Iran to the United States. Exhibit C\nconsists of Petitions for Alien Relatives that have been filed on behalf of his wife\u2019s\nparents and a copy of a check made to the Department of Homeland Security in the\namount of $355 for each parent. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law also signed a letter indicating\nthat she and her husband plan to immigrate to the United States as soon as their\npetitions are approved (Exhibit D).  \nApplicant owns two homes in the United States, one in which he lives and the\nother as a rental property. He does not own any property outside of the U.S. He testified\nthat since becoming a U.S. citizen he votes in all elections.\nThe president, vice-president and FSO of Applicant\u2019s employer testified on behalf\nof Applicant. They extolled his virtues as loyal, trustworthy ans conscientious about\nsecurity.\nCurrent Status of Iran\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iran. Currently, Iran is\nconsidered one of the most dangerous adversaries to the interests of the United States.\nThe U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the\nNovember 1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the\nhostage taking of 52 Americans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,\nIran\u2019s leader at the time.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are\nnot limited to the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of\nmass destruction, (2) its sponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into\nthe internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace\nprocess, and (5) its human rights violation against its own people. As a result of these\nconcerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n5\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of an Iranian passport raises foreign\npreference concerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship.\nHowever, Applicant did destroy or invalidate his foreign passport, by turning it\nover to his FSO, who has shredded it and maintains the remains in the company safe.\nAdditionally, he renounced his Iranian citizenship to the proper Iranian authorities,\nTherefore, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) (b) and (e) under this guideline apply to\nthis case. After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline C, I conclude that\nthe mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the disqualifying evidence. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s relatives, including his mother, father-in-law, mother-\nin-law, and brother-in-law, who are citizens and residents of Iran, a country whose\ninterest is inimical to the United States, make DC (a) and (d) a concern to the\nGovernment.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \n\n7\nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 34 years old, immigrated to the United States when\nhe was 5 and has lived the great majority of his life here. He has been a  U.S. citizen for\n12 years, and he is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen. He received two college\ndegrees in the U.S. While he did not consider himself an Iranian citizen, he sent a letter\nto the Iranian authorities to renounce his Iranian citizenship. He has also had his Iranian\npassport destroyed. He has been able to acquire two homes in the United States, and\nhe has no property outside of the U.S. His contact with his biological mother is almost\nnon-existent and to minimize any potential risk, he is in the process of having his\nparents-in-law move to the United States. Finally, Applicant has received many positive\nand laudatory recommendations from individuals that have known him over many years.\nI therefore, conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On November 27 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 24, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndecision was the result of bias, and violated Applicant\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made sustainable findings as follows:  Applicant is 39 years old, married with one\nchild, and works for a defense contractor in the health insurance business.  Applicant was born in\nRomania to parents of German descent.  Their ancestors moved to Romania during the 1500s.\nApplicant and her parents and siblings were able to immigrate from Romania to Germany in 1979.\nIn 1988, Applicant married her American husband, finished her professional education in Germany\nin hotel management, and moved to the United States.  Her family remained in Germany, but her\nbrother lives in Vienna, Austria.  Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR.\n \nApplicant has a German passport, issued in April 1998, and due to expire in April 2008.\nApplicant intends to renew her German passport.  At the same time she renews her passport, she\nintends to obtain a German passport for her daughter.  Applicant was told by her employer she had\nto apply for U.S. citizenship in July 2004, if she wanted to retain her job working on the military\ninsurance program.  Applicant applied for U.S. citizenship on her own time, and obtained her U.S.\ncitizenship in August 2005.  Applicant does not have a U.S. passport.  \nSince moving to the United States in 1989 with her husband, Applicant returned to Germany\nthree times on visits to her family.  She plans on making another trip in 2008 using her German\npassport.  Her last trip to Germany was in 1998.\nApplicant retains her German passport for several personal reasons.  One reason is that she\nwants to visit her family in Germany with her daughter, so four generations of Germans would have\na reunion.  She also wants to retain her German heritage, evidenced by her passport.  She was raised\n\n3\nas a German, and by having the passport she knows she will have a home outside of the United\nStates if she leaves the United States.  Next, no valid reason has been given to her by any American\nauthority to persuade her to surrender her German citizenship and passport.  She believes that,\u201cAs\na German, I am also responsible for carrying a German passport.\u201d  She also thinks that with her\nGerman passport she would not be regarded as a stranger in Germany when she visits her family.\nShe also sees a sentimental value in retaining her German citizenship, evidenced by her German\npassport.  Applicant was concerned that if she has to go to Germany to provide care for her aging\nparent for a long period of time, it is easier for her to go and stay using her German passport than\ntrying to get visas and other documents for permission from the German authorities.  Applicant also\nhad a concern about what she would tell a German customs or police officer about traveling to\nGermany without her German passport.\nApplicant states that she has a preference for the United States. She enjoys her job, and her\nresume shows she has worked her way up in her employer\u2019s organization.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains new evidence in the form of additional explanations, such\nas her statements that: \u201cI will use my German passport when I travel to Germany in the future \u201d and\n\u201cmy German connections are strong and important to me . . .\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 2.  The Board\ncannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s denial of a trustworthiness designation under the\nDirective was the result of bias, and amounts to national origin discrimination under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.  Neither of these arguments have merit.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether an applicant personally believes the Judge was\nunfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead\na reasonable person to question his fairness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n19, 2007).  Lack of impartiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings\nor reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,\n2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,\nstanding alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudice.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of persuasion, in\nthat she fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a\nreasonable person to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\n\nApplicant\u2019s case is subject to the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.  See Memorandum of the\n1\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, \u201cImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005).\u201d \n4\nThe Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority in Applicant\u2019s case is limited to reviewing it for\ncompliance with the Directive.   See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 through E3.1.35; ISCR Case No. 04-01961\n1\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul 12, 2007).  The Board does not have the jurisdiction or authority to entertain\nchallenges to the wisdom, legality or constitutionality of provisions of the Directive.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 03-23190 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007) citing DISCR Case No. 90-0208 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 24,\n1991)(no Board authority to hold that the Directive is unconstitutional); DISCR Case No. 99-0457\nat 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001) citing Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 215\n(1994)(adjudication of constitutionality of statutes is beyond the jurisdiction of administrative\nagencies).  Nor does the Board have jurisdiction or authority to pass judgement on the wisdom or\ndesirability of the guidance provided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001).  Likewise, the Board does not have jurisdiction\nor authority to adjudicate an applicant\u2019s rights under provisions of the U.S. Code.  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 02-33144 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2004).  The Board has reviewed the record in this case\nand concludes that the Applicant was provided with the rights set forth in the Directive.\n(2)  Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the\nJudge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s assertions of loyalty and allegiance to the United\nStates, and the \u201cpositive attributes of [her] life and work history.\u201d  These arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable trustworthiness decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-14978 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2008).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-22100 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness decision under Guideline\nC is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 12, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on January 15,\n2008, and assigned it to me on the same day.   DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nJanuary 25, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 13, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.\nMarch 24, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection.

Applicant was born in Romania to parents\nof German descent.  Their ancestors moved to Romania during the 1500s.  Applicant,\nher parents and siblings, were able to immigrate from Romania to Germany in 1979.  In\n1988, Applicant married her American husband, finished her professional education in\nGermany in hotel management, and moved to the United States.  Her family remained\nin Germany, but her brother lives in Vienna, Austria. (Tr. 21, 22, 31-33; Exhibits 1, 2, A)\nApplicant has a German passport, issued in April 1998, and due to expire in April\n2008.  Applicant intends to renew her German passport.  At the same time she renews\nher passport, she intends to obtain a German passport for her daughter.  Applicant was\ntold by her employer she had to apply for U.S. citizenship in July 2004, if she wanted to\nretain her job working on the military insurance program.  Applicant applied for U.S.\ncitizenship on her own time, and obtained her U.S. citizenship in August 2005.\nApplicant does not have a U.S. passport. (Tr. 15, 16, 19, 23, 33; Exhibits 1-3)\nSince moving to the United States in 1989 with her husband, Applicant returned\nto Germany three times on visits to her family.  She plans on making another trip in\n2008 using her German passport.  Her last trip to Germany was in 1998. (Tr. 15, 16, 32;\nExhibits 1-3)\nApplicant retains her German passport for several personal reasons.  One\nreason is that she wants to visit her family in Germany with her daughter, so four\ngenerations of Germans would have a reunion. She also wants to retain her German\nheritage, evidenced by her passport. She was raised as a German, and by having the\npassport she knows she will have a home outside of the United States if she leaves the\nUnited States.  Next, no valid reason has been given to her by any American authority\nto persuade her to surrender her German citizenship and passport. She believes that,\n\u201cAs a German, I am also responsible for carrying a German passport.\u201d  She also thinks\nthat with her German passport she would not be regarded as a stranger in Germany\nwhen she visits her family. She also sees a sentimental value in retaining her German\ncitizenship, evidenced by her German passport.  Applicant was concerned that if she\nhas to go to Germany to provide care for her aging parent for a long period of time, it is\neasier for her to go and stay using her German passport than trying to get visas and\nother documents for permission from the German authorities.  Applicant also had a\n\n3\nconcern about what she would tell a German customs or police officer about traveling to\nGermany without her German passport. (Tr. 18-20, 30, 35; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant claims she has a preference for the United States.  She enjoys her job,\nand her resume shows she has worked her way up in her employer\u2019s organization. (Tr.\n24; Exhibit A)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines are in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n4\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG &9:      \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security\nconcerns. Under AG &10(a)1, \u201cthe possession of a current foreign passport,\u201d is the only\none applicable in this case.  Applicant possesses a German passport, which she has\nretained since she immigrated to the United States. She does not have a U.S. passport,\nand does not intend to apply for one, at least until this case is decided.  She wants to\nuse the German passport to easily travel back to Germany to visit her parents.   It does\nnot expire until April 21, 2008.  She intends to renew this passport when it expires in\n2008.  Applicant expressed concern at the hearing as to what she would tell the\nGerman authorities if she attempted to enter Germany for a visit without a German\npassport, particularly for a long visit to care for her aging parents.\nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifted to\nApplicant to rebut or mitigate the allegations. The guideline also includes examples of\nconditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under the Foreign Influence\nguideline.  Under AG \u00b6 11, there are six potential Mitigating Conditions (MC); however,\nnone of them are  applicable in this case.  Although Applicant is now a U. S. naturalized\ncitizen ,she refuses to surrender or destroy her German passport, and, the MC requires\nthe passport be destroyed or invalidated before the Government grants a\ntrustworthiness determination.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\n\n5\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude that AG subparagraphs\n2-5, and 7-9 apply under the \u201c whole person\u201d concept.  In the present case, there is\nmuch information about positive attributes of Applicant\u2019s life and work history.\n  \nHowever, they are insufficient to outweigh the fact Applicant refuses to destroy or\ninvalidate her German passport.  She retains it voluntarily, making the decision as an\nadult, retains it and intends to renew it, and will continue to retain and use it in the\nfuture, despite her U.S. citizenship.  Her motivation is to keep her German heritage and\ncitizenship, and her connections to her family who reside in Germany and Austria.  In\nfact, the evidence strongly suggests that she prefers Germany over other countries,\nincluding the United States.  While she stated her preference for the United States, she\nmade more statements about: her sentimental attachment to her German heritage than\nthe United States; the need for her German passport to make long visits to Germany\nwhere she would not be seen as a stranger if she had her German passport; making\nvisits to her family as a German with four generations of Germans being at a family\nreunion; concern about what to tell a German officer where her German passport was if\nshe surrendered it in the United States; and as a  German, she has a responsibility to\ncarry a German passport.  All such statements persuade me Applicant considers\nherself more German than American, coupled with her act of retaining and soon\nrenewing her German passport while she has no U.S. passport. \nAccordingly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised under foreign preference. Guideline C is decided against her.  The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept  is decided against her for the same reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Spicker, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guidelines \nJ, Criminal Conduct, and E, Personal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn August 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated and received at DOHA on August \n31, 2009. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On December 3, \n2009, Department Counsel amended the SOR and withdrew allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.b, 2.c, \nand 2.d, and added new allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e, under Guideline E. \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant answered the amended SOR in an undated response received by DOHA on \nJanuary 4, 2010. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 7, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nJanuary 26, 2010. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12. Applicant did not \nobject and they were admitted. Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 3, 2010.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and denied all of \nthe remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He graduated from college in 2002. He is not married. \nHe has an 11 year old daughter. He began working for a federal contractor in 2004 and \nhas held a secret security clearance. He changed jobs in 2007 and works for a different \nfederal contractor.1 \n \nApplicant was arrested on April 5, 1998, and was charged with attempted grand \nlarceny and possession of burglarious tools, both felonies. He was also charged with \ndamage to property, a misdemeanor. Applicant explained that his compact disk system \nwas stolen from his car. He became aware of the person he believed stole his property. \nHe went to the person\u2019s house on two occasions to confront him and have him return \nhis property. The person was not home the third time Applicant went to the house, so he \ntook a screw driver, that he brought with him, and attempted to break into the person\u2019s \ncar to retrieve what he believed was his compact disk system. The police were called \nand Applicant was arrested and charged. Applicant stated he explained the facts to the \njudge and prosecutor and the charges were nolle prossed. Applicant knew he was \ncharged with felonies.2  \n \nOn May 26, 2000, Applicant was charged with reckless driving/speeding, a \nmisdemeanor. He hired an attorney and went to court. He was found guilty of the \ncharge. He stated he was unaware the charge was a misdemeanor.3 \n \nOn September 23, 2002, Applicant was charged with reckless driving, a \nmisdemeanor. On October 31, 2002, he was found guilty of improper driving and \nreceived a fine. Applicant stated he was unaware that he was charged with a \nmisdemeanor.4  \n \n \n1 Tr. 26, 39-41, 75. \n \n2 Tr. 31-32, 66-68, 86-89. \n \n3 Tr. 53-56. \n \n4 Tr. 69. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn December 2002, Applicant was working and got a new job. He told some \ncoworkers that he was leaving his first job, but did not tell his present employer. Rather \nhe left the job without giving notice to his employer. He stated he was not terminated \nand did not handle leaving his job in the correct manner.5  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) dated February 25, 2003, he \ndid not disclose he had been arrested and charged with two felonies in 1998 and three \nmisdemeanors, one in 1998, one in 2000, and another in 2002. He stated he did not list \nthe felonies because \u201cthey were thrown out\u201d although he acknowledged he was arrested \nand charged. He stated he did not know the reckless driving charges were \nmisdemeanors, so he did not list those either.6  \n \nOn January 5, 2004, Applicant was charged with fraud, a misdemeanor, and \ngrand larceny, a felony. On May 14, 2004, he was found guilty of fraud and petit \nlarceny, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one year in prison for the fraud, which \nwas suspended. On the petit larceny charge, he was sentenced to twelve months in \nprison, of which 11 months were suspended. He was also placed on probation for two \nyears. He served his sentence on the weekends. Applicant was represented by an \nattorney. Applicant stated despite pleading guilty, he did not commit these offenses. He \nstated he pled guilty to the misdemeanor because the case was continued five times \nand he had just stated a new job and was missing too much work. He did not know \nwhich side requested the continuances.7  \n \nRegarding the offenses, Applicant explained that he was at the barbershop and a \nfriend came in and offered to sell him stereo equipment. He went home to get some \nmoney and returned and bought the stereo equipment. He then learned he needed \nmoney to pay for his daughter\u2019s school. So he pawned the stereo equipment to get the \nmoney. A couple of days later he was contacted by the police and was told that the \nstereo equipment he had sold to the pawn shop was stolen. The property was stolen \nfrom the same car dealership where Applicant was working at that time. Applicant \nstated he did not know the property was stolen. When asked what happened with his \njob, Applicant stated he was fired when the employer learned he pled guilty to fraud and \nlarceny of the equipment stolen from them. Applicant did not include on his SCA that he \nwas fired from this job. He stated he did not know why he failed to disclose this \ninformation. He admitted this would be information that the government would want to \n \n5 Tr. 62-66. \n \n6 Tr. 42-44; GE 1. The SOR does not allege Applicant falsified the 2003 SCA. I have not considered this \ninformation for disqualifying purposed, but have considered it when analyzing the \u201cwhole-person\u201d and \ndetermining Applicant\u2019s credibility. \n \n7 Tr. 27-28, 34-35, 90-93. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nknow about and was requested on his SCA. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible.8  \n \nApplicant completed a SCA on December 8, 2004. He did not list that he was \ncharged with felonies in 1998. He explained he did not list the felonies because he \nmisread the question. He did not list the January 5, 2004, felony arrest because he did \nnot see the word \u201ccharged.\u201d He did list this charge later in the SCA and divulged the \nJanuary 5, 2004, misdemeanor, but did not list any of his other misdemeanor charges.9  \n \nOn September 7, 2005, while on probation, Applicant was charged with reckless \ndriving/speeding, a misdemeanor. On December 13, 2005, he was found guilty and \nfined. He did not go to court.10 \n \nOn August 29, 2008, Applicant was charged with speeding and driving with a \ntinted or smoked windshield. He was found guilty and was ordered to pay a fine of $476. \n \nApplicant completed a SCA on November 15, 2006. Section 23 asked if in the \nlast 7 years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not \nalready listed. Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d but failed to divulge the September 7, 2005, \nconviction for reckless driving. He also failed to divulge the September 23, 2002, and \nthe May 26, 2000, convictions for reckless driving.  \n \nSection 23 also asked if Appellant had ever been charged with or convicted of a \nfelony offense. He failed to divulge he was arrested for fraud and grand larceny in 1998, \nboth felonies. He failed to divulge that when he was arrested on January 4, 2004, the \noriginal charges were felony fraud and felony grand larceny. He did divulge that he was \nconvicted of a misdemeanor. He stated he did not think he had to divulge the 1998 \nfelony arrest because it was nolle prosque and he did not think it was on his record. He \nstated he did not divulge the 2004 arrest because he misunderstood the question and \ndid not see the word \u201ccharged\u201d in the question. He also stated that he was rushed when \nhe completed the SCA, but then explained that it was not the November 15, 2006, \napplication he was rushed on, but a different one he had completed. He stated he failed \nto divulge the information because it was an oversight. He explained he made a \nmistake.11 \n \nApplicant testified that he was always forthcoming about his criminal offenses \nwhen he was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on January 22, 2007, he told \n \n8 Tr. 29-31, 79-86; Applicant did not divulge that he had been fired from this job. This omission was not \nalleged on the SOR. I have not considered this information for disqualifying purposes, but have \nconsidered it when determining Applicant\u2019s credibility and when analyzing the \u201cwhole-person.\u201d \n \n9 Tr. 46-49. \n \n10 Tr. 56. \n \n11 Tr. 31-33, 35-39, 50-53, 62. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe investigator that he pled guilty to \u201cthe original charges for petty larceny and \nobtaining money under false pretenses.\u201d He did not tell the investigator that he was \noriginally charged with grand larceny.12  \n \nApplicant did not tell his security manager about his January 5, 2004 arrest. At \nsome point his security manager learned of the conviction and confronted Applicant with \nthe information.13  \n \nApplicant signed a SCA on December 8, 2004, and re-certified it on November 7, \n2005. He explained about the offense of January 5, 2004 by stating the following:  \n \nPurchase merchandise at a local barbershop. Short of cash a couple of \ndays later, took merchandise to Cash Converters, cash converter call me \nto inform me that the merchandise was stolen. Went to court show \nreceipts, court process was time consuming, missing hours at work, enter \na plea bargain.14  \n \nApplicant pled guilty to stealing the property and fraud. Applicant knew his \nstatements were false and he and he intentionally provided false and misleading \ninformation on his SCA. Applicant also provided false and misleading information on his \nNovember 15, 2006, SCA when he provided the following statement:  \n \nRegarding the misdemeanor offen[s]e. I purchase[d] a radio at the \nbarbershop I got (sic) to. The guy I purchase[d] it from show[ed] a receipt \nwhich was from the internet, I believed a [P]aypal receipt with ebay logo \non it. I thought it was legit so I bought it from him. A few days later I took it \nto Cash Converter because I miscalculated my money and I needed the \ncash. A couple of days later I received a phone call from the [city] police \nstating that it was stolen. I was in and out of court behind this missing \ndays at work. My employer and I was getting tired of me missing days so I \npleaded guilty to end it.15  \n \nOn December 20, 2006 Applicant provided false information to an OPM \ninvestigator when he was questioned about his 2004 conviction for larceny and fraud. \nHe provided the investigator the same false and misleading explanation stating he did \nnot know the property he bought at the barbershop was stolen. When in fact, Applicant \nactually stole the property and knew his statements were false as he had in fact pled \nguilty to stealing the property that eventually led to his larceny and fraud conviction.  \n \n \n12 Tr. 56-61; GE 6, 10, 11. \n \n13 Tr. 76-79. \n \n14 GE 2. \n \n15 GE 3. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested five times from April 1998 to September 2005. He was \ncharged in 1998 and again in 2004 with felonies. He pled guility to misdemeanor \ncharges of larceny, fraud, and reckless driving. Appellant was sentenced to a year in \nprison for his larceny conviction, which was suspended. He was sentenced to twelve \nmonths in jail for the fraud conviction, of which 11 months were suspended. He was on \nprobation for two years. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a seven-year history of criminal conduct, the most recent offense \noccurring in 2005. While on probation he committed another misdemeanor. He admitted \nthe property was stolen from the car dealer where he worked and that he pled guilty to \nthe offenses, but now denies the offenses. Applicant lied about his involvement \nregarding the larceny and fraud offenses. I find (a) does not apply because no evidence \nwas offered to show his conduct is unlikely to recur. I find his conduct casts doubt on his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreliability, good judgment and trustworthiness. Applicant did not provide evidence to \nconvince me he did not commit the offenses he pled guilty to. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and lack of credibility at his hearing I find he failed to provide any substantive \nevidence that he has changed his way and is successfully rehabilitated. I find mitigating \nconditions (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant intentionally and deliberately failed to divulge he was charged with \nfelonies. He also provided misleading and false information on his SCAs and to the \nOPM investigator. Applicant\u2019s numerous arrests and convictions are also a personal \nconduct concern. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s \nactions and false statements.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and conclude \nnone apply. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a college graduate. He \nhas worked for a federal contractor since 2004, and held a security clearance. Applicant \nhas a history of criminal conduct. He has been charged with felonies and \nmisdemeanors. He was charged with felony larceny and fraud and pled guilty to the \nreduced misdemeanor offenses. He stated he was tired of the delay in the process so \nhe accepted a plea agreement, but he was not guilty. He also admitted that the property \nthat he was accused of stealing was taken from his employer. He was later fired by the \nemployer because of his plea. He did not list he was fired on his SCA. He had no \nexplanation for why he did not disclose this information. Applicant\u2019s testimony \nthroughout the hearing lacked candor, he was not believable, and I find he deliberately \nlied. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his Criminal \nConduct and Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 22, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nJanuary 30, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 30, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two\nApril 7, 2008\n\n2\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 6, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is granted.\nBesides its three exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of nine\ndocuments:  Background Note: Taiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007); Taiwan:\nrecent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, Congressional Research Service, Library\nof Congress (October 2006); Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage 2000, National Counterintelligence Center; Press\nRelease, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (WD NY April 2006); Press Release,\nU.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January 2007); Statement of Facts\n[stipulated], United States v. Keyser, Crim. Case No.1:05CR543, (ED VA December\n2005); Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); Background Note: China, U.S. Department of\nState (January 2007); 2006 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security\nReview Commission (November 2006); Annual Report to Congress on foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage 2005, National Counterintelligence Executive -2005\n(August 2006); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, China (March 2007);\nConsular Information Sheet on China, U.S. Department of State (March 2007).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Taiwan.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Taiwan\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have parents and a brother who are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan, (b) to have a father-in-law and mother-in-law who are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan, and \u00a9) to have traveled to Taiwan from  approximately\nJune 1998 to July 1998, from December 1999 to January 2000, from December 2000 to\nJanuary 2001, from June 2002 to July 2002, from December 2004 to January 2005, and\nfrom December 2005 to January 2006. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR\nwith explanations.  He claimed to have no divided loyalties or foreign financial interests.\nHe claimed to have proudly used his U.S. passport to travel to Taiwan to visit his parents\nand parents-in-law who are growing old.  And he claimed that Taiwan has not been\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or has not been\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior engineering specialist for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the U.S. in 1982 (R.T., at 34-35).\nHe studied engineering at a prestigious U.S. university and received both M.S. and PhD\ndegrees from the same university.  Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in July\n2000 and received his U.S. passport in October of the same year (see exs. 1 and 3;\nR.T., at 36).  He is uncertain whether he relinquished his Taiwan citizenship and\npassport but is positive that it expired two or three years ago and cannot be used\nanymore (R.T., at 37, 60).  Applicant believes it is possible that the Taiwan government\nstill considers him a dual citizen, but he is not sure.  \nBefore immigrating to the U.S., Applicant served as an infantry officer in the\nTaiwan Army between 1980 and 1982 (R.T., at 37-38).  He received his discharge and\nhas no further reserve responsibilities, so long as he does not return to Taiwan to live\n(R.T., at 38-40).  He has no contacts with individuals he knew in the military, and his last\ncontacts with the Taiwan military occurred before he immigrated to the U.S. (R.T., at 40).\nApplicant has never been employed by national or local governments or intelligence\nagencies of Taiwan or the PRC (R.T., at 40-41).\nShortly after immigrating to the U.S. (i.e., inn August 2003), Applicant married his\ncurrent wife (see ex. 1).  Like Applicant, his wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nJuly 2000 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 43-44).  He and his wife have one daughter (age 18) who\nwas born in the U.S. and currently attends college at a local university (see ex. 1; R.T., at\n44).  Applicant\u2019s parents (ages 78 and 84, respectively) are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan (see ex. 1; R.T., at 44-45).  Before their retirement, his father and mother worked\nfor more than 40 years for a Taiwan bank (R.T., at 45-46).  The bank was government-\nowned before its privatization a number of years ago (R.T., at 46).  Neither of Applicant\u2019s\nparents have any official relationships or contacts with the Taiwan government (R.T., at\n46-47).  Applicant\u2019s father has no prior military service (R.T., at 46).  His parents each\nhave bank pensions (R.T., at 51-53).  They have no government pensions., but receive\nhealth benefits from the Taiwan government (R.T., at 51). \nBesides his parents, Applicant has a younger brother who is a citizen and resident\nof Taiwan.  His brother spent two years in the Taiwan military and may have some\nreserve responsibilities (R.T., at 50-51).  Military service is mandatory in Taiwan.  His\nbrother is a sales manager for a Taiwanese appliance company.  His wife is a marketing\ndeputy manager for a cosmetics company (see ex. A).  They reside in one of the units of\na duplex owned by Applicant\u2019s parents (R.T., at 49).  Applicant has no knowledge of any\nmilitary or government contacts by either his brother or his wife.  He has no known\nrelatives (immediate or extended family) residing in the PRC (R.T., at 51).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were both born in the PRC and\ncurrently are citizens and residents of Taiwan (R.T., at 52-53).  The father-in-law\noperates a school maintenance department; while the mother-in-law is a housewife\n(R.T., at 53-54).  The father-in-law does receive a pension from a local city school district\n(R.T., at 53).  Both in-laws were born in the PRC and moved to Taiwan in 1949.  They\neach have relatives who reside in the PRC, but have no known contact with these\nrelatives (most of whom have  passed away).  His wife\u2019s only surviving grandparent has\nsince returned to his roots (the PRC) to live (R.T., at 56).\nThrough his in-laws, Applicant has several brother-in-laws and sister-in-laws who\nare citizens and residents of Taiwan as well (R.T., at 52-53).  His first brother-in-law is a\nmanager of a city library; while this brother-in-law\u2019s wife is a lecturer in a local Taiwan\nnursing school.  Another brother-in-law lectures in a local college, and his wife is an\nadministrator  of a Taiwan university (see ex. A).  \nApplicant has no friends or associates who are employed by any foreign\ngovernment.  He has no assets or financial interests in Taiwan or other foreign country\n(R.T., at 58).   By contrast, all of his assets are in the U.S.  \nBefore becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant made a number of trips to\nTaiwan to visit his parents and other family members: specifically, from June to July\n1998 and December 1999 to January 2000.  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he has\nmade trips with his wife and daughter to Taiwan: specifically, from December 2000 to\nJanuary 2001, June 2002 to July 2002, December 2004 to June 2002, December 2004\nto January 2005, December 2005 to January 2006, and more recently, December 2007\nto January 2008 (see exs. 1 and A; R.T., at 59).  While it is not clear from the record\nwhich passports he used after he became a U.S. citizen, he could not have used his\nTaiwan passport to enter and exit Taiwan after its expiration in 2006, or thereabouts.  \nApplicant maintains regular monthly telephone contacts with his parents (R.T., at \n47).  However, he has much less telephone contact with other members of his family.\nHe talks with his brother maybe once every six months (R.T., at 52), and he converses\nwith his mother-in-law and father-in-law only when he visits Taiwan (R.T., at 54).\nAlthough, his wife talks to her parents every two to three weeks.  Applicant has no\nreason to believe that any of his own family or his wife\u2019s family who reside in Taiwan are\nat any risk to pressure or influence from either the Taiwan or PRC governments (R.T., at\n60).\nSupervisors and co-professionals who have known and worked with Applicant for\na number of years praise his engineering and research contributions and commend him\nfor his integrity and trustworthiness (see ex. B).  His managing director  ranks him as one\nof his top employees and a professional who has consistently demonstrated an\nexemplary work ethic and personal integrity, and earned the respect of his peers and\nsubordinates (see ex. B).  Applicant\u2019s supervisor credits Applicant with exceptional\nintegrity and trust and characterizes him as one of his department\u2019s most valuable\nresearch sources (ex. B). \n\n5\n Taiwan\u2019s country status\nTaiwan has a rich history that dates back 12 to 15 thousand years.  Dutch and\nSpanish colonists claimed the island in the 16  and 17  centuries (see Background Note:\nth\nth\nTaiwan, U.S. Department of State (April 2007)).  Migration from the Chinese mainland\nover time supplanted the  aboriginal peoples of Taiwan.  Japan exerted considerable\ninfluence over Taiwan following China\u2019s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in 1895 (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule.  Civil\nwar erupted soon after the reversion between Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s KMT government and\nthe increasingly influential Chinese Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong.  When the\ncivil war ended in 1949, 2 million refugees (predominantly nationalists) fled to Taiwan,\nwhere Chiang Kai-Shek established a separate provisional KMT capital in Taipei (see\nBackground Note: Taiwan, supra, at 3). Mao\u2019s victorious Communist party, in turn,\nestablished the People\u2019 s Republic of China (PRC).\nFor the past one-half century, Taiwan has demonstrated steady economic\ndevelopment and now is a major international trading power.  Its accession to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) in 2002 represented a significant achievement and\nstrengthened its standing in the expanding global economy. \nTaiwan exhibited steady political development as well since its establishment as\nan island government. Changes reflect a continuing liberalizing process that culminated\nin the tightly contested election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000 (see Background Note:\nTaiwan, supra, at 3).   Chen\u2019s DPP party won major parliamentary victories in 2000 and\nagain in 2004, enabling Chen to become the first opposition party candidate to win the\npresidency.  Chen was re-elected in 2004 on a platform that included a \u201cdefensive\nreferendum\u201d (Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Such referenda have been\nhistorically perceived to be closely linked to the question of Taiwan\u2019s independence.\nToday\u2019s Taiwan political system is a multi-party democracy under a Constitutional\numbrella comprising five branches: executive, legislative, judicial, control and\nexamination.  Taiwan\u2019s reported human rights record and demonstrated respect for the\nrule of contract in its commercial relations is quite good.\nTaiwan\u2019s PRC relations\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is\nonly \u201cone China\u201d (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 6).  Despite differences over\nthe PRC\u2019s one China policy, Taiwan and the PRC have enjoyed increased contacts over\nthe past decade. With Taiwan\u2019s continued relaxation of its PRC policy regarding\nunofficial contacts, cross-strait interactions have grown significantly.  Efforts by the PRC,\nhowever, to resume cross-strait dialogue without any preconditions have been hampered\nby the PRC\u2019s insistence that the two sides first reach consensus that there is only \u201cone\nChina\u201d before restarting talks (see id.).  Cheng has recognized the PRC\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d\n\n6\ninsistence but to date has declined to condone the concept.  With both sides unwilling to\ncompromise this obstacle, they have cautiously felt each other out with smaller\nintermediary steps like cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights, sale of Taiwan\nagricultural products in the PRC, and PRC tourists visiting Taiwan (see id).  \nThe PRC operates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the MSS\n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency\nOPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), at 71 (June 2004)).  The MSS maintains active\nintelligence gathering operations in Taiwan (see id., at 72).  These operations use\nclandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who\nare suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see Intelligence\nThreat Handbook, supra, at 72). \nCompounding security concerns over the PRC\u2019s robust intelligence gathering\noperations in Taiwan is the PRC regime\u2019s poor human rights record.  The State\nDepartment reports an increased number of high profile cases in the PRC involving the\nmonitoring, harassment, detention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers,\nactivists, and defense lawyers seeking to exercise their law-protected rights (see China,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, U.S. Department of State (March\n2007)).  The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible accounting of all those\nkilled, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in custody, disappearance,\ntorture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (see id., at 2-3).\nWhile the PRC officially denies holding any political prisoners, Western non-government\norganizations estimate that approximately 500 persons remained in prison in 2006 for the\nrepealed crime of counterrevolution, and thousands of others were either serving\nsentences or were being detained for counter-revolutionary offenses (id., at 8).  State\nDepartment advisories caution American citizens visiting or residing in China to take the\nnormal safety precautions and remain aware of their individual surroundings (see\nConsular Information Sheet, U.S. Department of State, March 2007).  \nIn the current political environment, it is still too early to predict the direction of\ncross-strait negotiations between Taiwan and the PRC.  Because of the PRC\u2019s long\ninsistence on Taiwan\u2019s acceptance of the \u2018one China\u201d principle as a requisite to any jump-\nstarting of negotiations over practical agreements in trade, cultural exchanges, and other\nareas of mutual interest, future relations between the two sides remain cloudy at best.\nU.S.-Taiwan relations\nIn a joint communique with the PRC in January 1979, the U.S. announced its\nrecognition of the PRC government as the sole government of China.  In this joint\ncommunique, the U.S. accepted that there is but one China, of which Taiwan is a part\n(see Background Note; China, U.S. Department of State, at 8 (January 2007).  The joint\ncommunique stated that within this context the people of the U.S. will maintain cultural,\ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.\n\n7\nTo implement the Joint communique, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act\n(TRA) in April 1979.  President Carter, in turn, signed the legislation into law on April 10,\n1979.  Besides providing the legal basis for maintaining the U.S. unofficial relationship\nwith Taiwan, the TRA reinforced the U.S. commitment to provide defense assistance to\nTaiwan.  The TRA expressly provides for the continued sale of appropriate defensive\nmilitary equipment to Taiwan and declares that peace and stability in the area are in U.S.\ninterests (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 9).  Although the U.S. terminated its\nMutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan following its de-recognition of the latter, it has\ncontinued its sale of appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan (see id.).\nWhile ambiguously written, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u2019s security against\ncross-Strait aggression by the PRC\u2019s military forces is implicit in the TRA\u2019s coverage of\nU.S. responsibilities towards Taiwan.  This implicit construction is oft-used to support\nproponents of a \u201ctwo China\u201d policy.  To be sure, initial actions of the Bush Administration\nin 2001 provided cause to conclude the new President had abandoned longstanding U.S.\npolicy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in favor of a policy that placed a clearer emphasis on\nTaiwan\u2019s interests at the expense of the PRC (see Taiwan: Recent Developments and\nU.S. Policy Choices, CRS Report to Congress, at 13 (October 2006)).  More recent\ndevelopments, though, reflect the smoothing of U.S.-PRC relations as a part of the\nbroader war on terrorism.  \nCurrently, the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral\nsteps by either side to alter the status quo (see Background Note; China, supra, at 20).\nFor so long as Taiwan\u2019s national security remains under threat (both veiled and unveiled)\nfrom the PRC, Taiwan can be expected to pursue the development of its military amidst\nexpectations of military assistance from the U.S.  Stressing self-reliance, Taiwan\nmaintains a large military establishment (accounting for 15.3 per cent of its central\nbudget).  Its principal mission is to defend itself against the PRC, which has not\nrenounced the use of force against Taiwan (see Background Note: Taiwan, supra, at 8). \nWith its unchanged public policy of maintaining \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d in its official relations\nwith Taiwan, the U.S. can be expected to continue its support of Taiwan\u2019s island security\nwith the sale of defensive military equipment.\nTaiwan\u2019s economic collection practices\nBased on past reports to Congress, Taiwan is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.  In its 2000 Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, the preparers  list\nTaiwan as well as the PRC among the most active collectors based on cited surveys (see\n2000 Annual Report  to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage, National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), at 16).  Specific incidents are\ncited  in the NACIC Report that identify offenders of proprietary information thefts and\nattempts to acquire export-restricted products (see id., 7-10). \nRecent espionage convictions document ongoing collection activities covering theft\nof sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan companies (see, e.g., 2006\n\n8\nReport to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, at 139\n(November 2006); Press Release, U.S. Department of justice, U.S. Attorney (WD NY\nApril 2006); Press Release, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney (ED VA January\n2007), and Statement of Facts (stipulated),  No.1:05CR 543 (December 2005). \nMultilateral export control regimes in place are voluntary and not universally adhered to\nby member nations (see id., at 143).\nStress points between Taiwan, the PRC and the U.S.\nIn its November 2006 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage (see 2006 Report to Congress, supra, at 138.  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to\nacquire sensitive technology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence\nmeasures.  Recent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight\nthe PRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating  its own 2004 U.S.-China\nagreement, the PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use\nitems licensed for export to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they\nare multilateral in scope (see id.).  Multilateral export controls and arms embargoes,\nhowever, do  provide additional insurance against altering the cross-strait military balance\nthat has been long maintained (see id., at 144).\nWithout effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be expected to\nacquire dual use technologies with military potential from the U.S. and Taiwan through the\nU.S. and other source countries.  Reported intelligence, though, is lacking on any Taiwan\nuse of its collection resources in the U.S. to supply the PRC with needed military\ntechnology (alone or through technology with known dual use capabilities).\nOther stress points between the PRC and Taiwan are reflected in periodic PRC\nmilitary exercises in the Taiwan Straits (see Background Note: China, supra, at 19).  More\nfrequent U.S.-PRC high-level exchanges have the potential to reduce cross-strait military\ntensions (id., at 19).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\n\n9\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\n\n10\nANALYSIS\nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan in\n1982 to pursue higher education goals.  Security concerns focus on members of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family (i.e., his parents and brother) and in-laws who are citizens\nand residents of Taiwan, a country  historically friendly to the U.S., albeit, one with a\nreported history of economic collection activities in the U.S.\nDepartment Counsel urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s parents,\nbrother and in-laws residing in Taiwan, might be subject to undue foreign influence by\nTaiwanese government authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control.  Because Applicant\u2019s immediate family members and in-laws\nreside in Taiwan, they present potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying\ncondition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The\ncitizenship/residence status of these immediate family members and in-laws in Taiwan\npose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign\ninfluence that could compromise sensitive or classified information under Applicant's\npossession and/or control. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s father and brother both have prior military service (although\naged for the most part), some consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is\nwarranted as well.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents, brother/wife, and in-laws\nresiding in Taiwan afford him some potential for accessing Taiwan officials who might be\ninterested in proprietary, sensitive, or even classified information that Applicant is privy to.\nStill, none of Applicant\u2019s family members have any identified affiliations or contacts with\nTaiwan officials currently known to be associated with intelligence or military\norganizations interested in collecting proprietary or sensitive information in the U.S.\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family and in-laws residing in Taiwan have any political affiliations with\nTaiwan\u2019s government or military, have any history to date of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Applicant\u2019s mother and\nfather worked for a Taiwan bank for many years before they retired with private pensions.\nWith the exception of their government-funded health benefits, his parents have no\nfinancial interests associated with the Taiwan government.  While his brother and spouse\nare employed by consumer-oriented companies located in Taiwan, they, too, have no little\nvisible connections with the Taiwan government or military/intelligence establishment.  \n\n11\nUpon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his immediate family and in-\nlaws, any risk of undue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his parents, brother and in-\nlaws would appear to be insubstantial, and clearly not of the magnitude that could make\nthem subject to a heightened security risk of pressure or compromise under Guideline B.\nTaiwan, although a country reported to have targeted U.S. economic and\nproprietary interests in the past, enjoys a special relationship with the U.S. through the\nTRA, and is a democratic government with a history of respect for human rights and the\nrule of law.  While Taiwan has been a reported active collector of economic intelligence in\nthe U.S., it has not been known to use acquired information to harm U.S. strategic\ninterests.  Taiwan remains a member in good standing with the WTO, and a constructive\ntrading partner with the U.S., who at times has itself been targeted by agents of the PRC\nfor intelligence collection on Western groups thought to be promoting democracy and\nengaging in anti-communist activities directed at the PRC.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Taiwan. \nThe special relationship that has existed between the U.S. and Taiwan over the\npast half-century has been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and economic\ninterests. Reports of Taiwan intelligence gathering against U.S. companies are\ncounterbalanced by Taiwan\u2019s history of friendship and partnership in a defense pact\nformalized in 1979.  The mutually supportive bonds that have linked Taiwan\u2019s special\nrelationship with the U.S. have not been weakened by either the TRA, or the  geopolitical\nforces that have shaped the U.S.\u2019s evolving relationship with the PRC.  Whatever\npotential heightened security risks arise as the result of Applicant's having family\nmembers with citizenship and residency in Taiwan are by every reasonable measure\nmitigated.  \nTaiwan remains a friend of the U.S. and is a country whose democratic institutions\nare not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of\nlaw.  Unlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take into account the\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter.  Taiwan, while reported to target the U.S. and its companies in\nthe past for economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no known recent\nhistory of hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence against family\nmembers to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary\ndata. \n\n12\nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's immediate\nand extended family members in Taiwan  (a country whose interests have recently been\nand continue to be friendly to those of the U.S.), any potential heightened risk of a\nhostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either\nclassified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant through his family\nmembers residing in Taiwan is an acceptable one.  Applicant, accordingly, may take\nadvantage of one important mitigating condition: MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or\nactivities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nMC (8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or\nthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d has application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Both at home and through those in\nsenior positions with Applicant\u2019s employer, Applicant demonstrated loyalty, patriotism,\nand professional commitments to the U.S. since becoming a naturalized citizen in 2000.\nWhatever potential conflicts he may have through his dual Taiwan citizenship and\ncontacts with his family members in Taiwan have been more than counterbalanced by his\ndemonstrated U.S. citizenship responsibilities.  \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflict\nof interests with his Taiwan family members.  Not only has Applicant become a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen and received his advance degrees in the U.S., but he has made\nevery effort to work, save, and pursue his financial interests exclusively in the U.S.\nApplicant is highly regarded and trusted by his managing director and supervisor and is\nnot aware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his family members\nmight be exposed to.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on any of his immediate family members and in-laws would appear to be minimal.\nBy all reasonable accounts of the presented record,  Applicant has no visible conflicts of\ninterest with Taiwan citizen/residents or property interests in Taiwan that could be at risk\nto exploitation or compromise by Taiwan military or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members\nand in-laws residing in Taiwan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his\nfamilial relationships in Taiwan.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline B.\n\n13\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Rigney, Esquire \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 1, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline E for personal conduct and Guideline M for misuse of\ninformation technology systems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nMay 30, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on November 16, 2007, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on April 15, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 23,\n2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges: (1) two incidents of workplace misconduct;\n(2) two incidents of termination from employment; and (3) two incidents of falsifying\nmaterial facts on a security-clearance application by failing to disclose the complete\nreasons for his terminations. Under Guideline M, the SOR alleges he violated company\npolicy by accessing and maintaining sexually explicit material on his workplace\ncomputer. Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was mixed. Based on the record evidence as\na whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since September 2003. His current position or job title is\ncommunications engineer. He is seeking to retain an industrial security clearance that\nhe has held for several years. \nApplicant has been married and divorced three times. He served on active duty\nin the U.S. Marine Corps during the period 1987\u20131998, and he received an honorable\ndischarge. He held a security clearance for some of time he was on active duty. His\neducational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer networking awarded\nin 2000. In addition to his current job, his postgraduate employment history is as follows:\n\u2022\nMarch 2000\u2013April 2001: other employment as an engineer.\n\u2022\nApril 2001\u2013July 2001: employment with a federal contractor as an engineer.\n\u2022\nJuly 2001\u2013August 2002: employment with a federal contractor as an engineer.\n\u2022\nOctober 2002\u2013February 2003: employment with a federal contractor (Employer\nA) as an information systems security manager (ISSM), which ended in his\ntermination.\n\u2022\nFebruary 2003\u2013August 2003: employment with a federal contractor (Employer B)\nas an engineer, which ended in his termination.\n\n3\nApplicant was terminated from his job as an ISSM with Employer A in February\n2003. His termination was based on a combination of unsatisfactory performance and\nviolation of company policy by having material on his computer (e-mail) that could be\nconsidered obscene and offensive (Exhibits 2 and 4). Applicant was on the receiving\nend of e-mails that contained the material. The evidence does not establish that\nApplicant sought out such material by accessing Web sites. In addition, it appears\nApplicant had a personality conflict with his supervisor as his last day ended in a heated\nmeeting when Applicant stated he quit and the supervisor stated Applicant was fired (Tr.\n42). \nWhen he left this job, Applicant already had another job offer, which he accepted\nwith Employer B. The job was located on a military installation at a remote site.\nApplicant was then dating his third wife and they decided to marry so she would be\nallowed to accompany him. They married in February 2003, Applicant arrived at the\nremote site on March 1, 2003, and his wife followed the next month. The marriage and\nrelocation to the remote site proved to be a mistake, as the marriage was full of conflict.\nIt reached the point where Applicant requested that Employer B send his wife and her\nson home. After her departure from the remote site, she harassed Applicant via e-mail,\nwhich included sending e-mails to his superiors. Her harassment extended to one of\nApplicant\u2019s sisters who eventually took action by bringing criminal charges against his\nwife that resulted in a misdemeanor conviction (Tr. 137\u2013162). \nApplicant was terminated from his job as an engineer with Employer B in August\n2003. His termination was based on an investigation that concluded that Applicant had\nunauthorized government property in his government quarters (Exhibit 5). It appears the\ninvestigation was commenced based on an e-mail from his wife. In addition, it appears\nthat a factor in the termination was that Applicant\u2019s superiors at the remote location had\ntired of dealing with his ongoing domestic problem. \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in 2006 (Exhibit 1).\nConcerning his employment history, Question 22 asked him to answer the following\nquestion: \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years?\n1. Fired from a job.\n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.\n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations on misconduct.\n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory\nperformance.\n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. \nHe reported that he quit his job with Employer A after being told he would be fired. He\nexplained that he had accepted another job and that he and his supervisor were in a\ndispute over job responsibilities. He did not disclose that his termination was based on\nunsatisfactory performance or the e-mail issue. For Employer B, he reported that he had\nbeen fired from his job due to misbehavior of family members on a military installation.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nHe did not disclose that his termination was based on the unauthorized government\nproperty issue.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n15\n5\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n14\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n15\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe gravamen of the SOR is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question\n22 in his security-clearance application. He denies that his responses to Question 22\nwere intentionally false. For Employer A, he contends that he resigned amid a clash of\npersonalities with his supervisor. For Employer B, he contends that the real reason or\nmotivation for his termination was his unacceptable ongoing domestic problem. \n\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n16\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n See Directive, \u00b6 6.2 (\u201cAn applicant is require to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful\n17\nanswers to relevant and material questions needed by DOHA to reach a clearance decision and to otherwise\ncomply with procedures authorized by this Directive.\u201d). \n See DC 3 and DC 4. \n18\n DC 7 is the \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a\n19\ncondition of employment.\u201d\n6\nHis contentions and explanations are not credible. Although his job with\nEmployer A ended in an \u201cI quit \u2013 You\u2019re fired\u201d meeting, his listed reason on the security-\nclearance application was incomplete, misleading, and false because it omitted any\nmention of the unsatisfactory performance and for having material on his computer (e-\nmail) that could be considered obscene and offensive. Given the documentary evidence\n(Exhibits 2 and 4), it is misleading to characterize his departure from Employer A as\nresigning or quitting based on a dispute with a supervisor.  \nLikewise, for Employer B, his listed reason for the termination was incomplete,\nmisleading, and false because it omitted any mention of the unauthorized government\nproperty issue. Whatever the company\u2019s motivation, he knew the company\u2019s official\nreason for the termination because he had received the termination letter (Exhibit 5) or\nhad seen the letter before he departed the remote site or both (Tr. 20\u201326, 55, 58, 70).\nDespite that knowledge, he did not report that information about his termination.  \nGiven his age, military experience, and experience as an employee in the\ndefense industry, he had to know that two job terminations in the same year for these\nreasons might be a problem for his security clearance. An applicant for a security\nclearance is not allowed to pick and choose the details to disclose, but instead is\nobliged to give a complete accounting even if that means disclosing derogatory\ninformation. Applicant gave reasons for his terminations in the light most favorable to\nhim. He did not give a complete accounting, and in doing so he deliberately omitted,\nconcealed, or falsified material facts about the reasons for his terminations.  In other\n16\nwords, his answer to Question 22 was at best a half-truth\u2014it was not a full, frank, and\ntruthful answer.  \n17\nIn addition to the falsification issues, the evidence of Applicant\u2019s workplace\nmisconduct and terminations raise security concerns under Guideline E.  For example,\n18\nhis termination for having inappropriate material on his e-mail violated written company\npolicy.19\nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\n\n Revised Guidelines at 26\u201327 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions).  \n7\nsecurity-clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away,\nextenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nThe SOR allegation under Guideline M  is, in substance, redundant with and\n20\nrepetitive of the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. It is unnecessary to address the\nGuideline M matters because the security concerns are adequately addressed under\nGuideline E. In addition, it will make no difference in the ultimate outcome of the case\nand the law does not require a futile or pointless act.  \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nfalsification of the security-clearance application was given great weight, and the case\nwould have been decided against Applicant on this basis alone. Likewise, the whole-\nperson concept (including his honorable military service, his problems with his third wife,\nand his favorable character evidence) was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-references the sole allegation under Guideline M. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 52-year-old employee for a company engaged in defense contracting. His educational background includes a bachelor of science in electrical engineering. He has worked for his current employer as a senior science advisor since October 2006 (Exhibit D). He was worked in the defense industry and held a security clearance for approximately the last 20 years. His current annual salary is about $120,000.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 15, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline M for misuse of information technology systems and\nGuideline E for personal conduct, both of which are based on Applicant\u2019s misuse of a\ngovernment computer at his place of work.  \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nFebruary 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 30, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\nhearing took place as scheduled on January 29, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on February 6, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 15, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted two\nletters vouching for his good character. The post-hearing exhibits were forwarded by\ndepartment counsel who made no objections. The letters are marked and admitted as\nExhibits E and F. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline M, the SOR alleges that in May 2006 Applicant\u2019s assigned\ngovernment computer had inappropriate material on it in the form of \u201chacker tools\u201d and\nadult-content material. Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-references the sole allegation\nunder Guideline M. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee for a company engaged in defense\ncontracting. His educational background includes a bachelor of science in electrical\nengineering. He has worked for his current employer as a senior science advisor since\nOctober 2006 (Exhibit D). He was worked in the defense industry and held a security\nclearance for approximately the last 20 years. His current annual salary is about\n$120,000. Based on performance reviews covering 2003\u20132007, Applicant is a highly\ncompetent employee who produces high quality work (Exhibits A\u2013D).\n On Friday, May 19, 2006, an inspection discovered that Applicant\u2019s assigned\ngovernment computer had inappropriate material on it in the form of \u201chacker tools\u201d and\nadult-content material (Exhibit 3). Applicant was then an onsite company employee at a\ngovernment facility and his computer was connected to the network system (Tr. 70-71).\nApplicant was escorted off the premises and interviewed. He reported that a computer\ndisc\u2014obtained at a military test facility\u2014contained the \u201chacker tools\u201d (Exhibit 3).\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s behavior was not in compliance with the rules for using a\ngovernment computer, the Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) determined that\nthe incident was not a criminal matter and should be handled internally within the\ncommand. On Monday, May 22, 2006, Applicant returned to work at the company\n\n3\nlocation after he was orally reprimanded for not complying with established rules and\nwas re-briefed on security issues. Applicant was specifically told that he violated a\nbriefing he signed when he was given access to the computer and that he introduced\nsoftware onto the computer without having it approved by the company program office\n(Exhibit 3 at 2). About a week later, he returned to the government facility where he\nworked until joining his current employer in October 2006. \nApplicant addressed the May 2006 incident during his hearing testimony. He\npreviously discussed the incident in April 2007 during an investigative interview (Exhibit\n2). Concerning the \u201chacker tools,\u201d he explained it took place as part of his day-to-day\nwork and it was not an attempt by him to hack the government computer system. He\nobtained the computer disc from another contractor who worked at a military test facility\nlocated in another state. The disc had a label that suggested to Applicant that it was\nappropriate to use it. Applicant understood the disc contained software to validate\nwhether a computer system was secure (Tr. 68\u201370). Applicant took the disc back to his\nwork location and attempted to use it. He did not load it onto his computer because he\nwas not a system administrator (Tr. 71). Instead, he ran the program off the disc and\nimmediately received a \u201chacker alert\u201d alarm on his computer (Tr. 71\u201372). He shut the\nprogram down and placed the disc in an overhead bin where it remained until a few\ndays later when the investigation commenced.\nThe ensuing investigation and audit of Applicant\u2019s computer discovered the\n\u201chacker tools\u201d and adult-content material. Applicant agrees that he wrongfully used his\ngovernment computer to access adult-content material. One of the Web sites he visited\nwas for dating or match making (Tr. 74). He also admits that he visited this Web site on\nseveral occasions because he was curious, but he never acted on it. Based on this\nrecord, none of the Web sites involved nudity or sexually-explicit material. \nApplicant has been married to the same woman since 1974. The couple have\ntwo adult children. His 31-year-old daughter is living on her own. His 23-year-old son is\nliving at home recovering from a failed marriage and an unsuccessful college\nexperience. Also, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is living with Applicant and his wife. His wife\nworks as a secretary for transcription at a medical office. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has never heard him discuss the nature of his work on  behalf of\nthe government. She became aware of the May 2006 incident when Applicant came\nhome that day and told her about it. She described Applicant as her best friend, her\nrock, and they rely on each other for everything (Tr. 63).\nIn addition to his wife, a coworker presented favorable character evidence for\nApplicant. The coworker, a retired Army officer, has seen nothing of security\nsignificance during the 18 months he has worked with Applicant. He describes Applicant\nas a high-quality person who does high-quality work. In addition, the two post-hearing\nletters, one from a personal contact and the other from a professional contact, attest to\nApplicant\u2019s good character and suitability (Exhibits E and F).\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 26\u201327 (setting forth the mitigating and disqualifying conditions).\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 26. \n15\n DC 6 is the  \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any\n16\ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or\nregulations.\u201d\n DC 5 is the \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\u201d\n17\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline M,  the security concern is that \u201cnoncompliance with rules,\n14\nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may\nraise security concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into\nquestion the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer hardware,\nsoftware, firmware, and data used for the communication, transmission, processing,\nmanipulation, storage, or protection of information.\u201d15\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant misused his\ngovernment computer based on the May 2006 incident. Also, the record evidence\nsupports application of two disqualifying conditions under Guideline M. First, by using\nthe disc that contained the \u201chacker tools,\u201d Applicant introduced software onto an\ninformation technology system without proper authorization.  Second, Applicant\n16\nengaged in the unauthorized use of a government computer by using it to access Web\nsites containing adult-content material.  Both  matters raise a security concern and may\n17\nbe disqualifying because the matters call into question Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline M has three conditions that could mitigate the security concern, and\nthose conditions are as follows:\n\n Revised Guidelines at 26\u201327. \n18\n6\n1.\n[S]o much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n2.\n[T]he misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency\nand effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's password or\ncomputer when no other timely alternative was readily available; and,\n3.\n[T]he conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt,\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.18\n \nEach MC is discussed below.\nThe first MC applies to the \u201chacker tools\u201d aspect of the May 2006 incident. It\napplies because the incident happened under circumstances where Applicant honestly\nbelieved that the disc he was using was appropriate given (a) how he came into\npossession of it and (b) his understanding of its purpose or function. These\ncircumstances are unusual enough to suggest that a similar incident is unlikely to recur.\nIt no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because\nthis incident was an honest mistake. MC 1 does not, however, apply to the adult-content\nmaterial aspect of the May 2006 incident. \nThe second MC applies to the \u201chacker tools\u201d aspect of the May 2006 incident for\ntwo reasons. First, it applies because it was a minor incident in the scheme of things.\nThe action taken against Applicant was limited to (a) losing a day of work when he was\nescorted off the premises and (b) an oral reprimand. This low-level action suggests that\nthe matter was not viewed as a major or serious violation. Had the responsible authority\nviewed it otherwise, it is likely they would have taken more serious action\u2014such as\nwritten reprimand, a multi-day suspension, or termination\u2014against Applicant. Also, the\nfact that he returned to work at the government facility is probative. Had officials viewed\nthe incident as a major violation, it is likely they would have banned Applicant from the\ngovernment facility. Second, MC 2 applies because the reason Applicant used the disc\non the government computer was because he believed, based on his visit to the military\ntest facility, that the disc would help him with his work. Indeed, the evidence does not\nsuggest Applicant was trying to hack into the system or engage in some other type of\nmalicious behavior. Indeed, once he received the alarm, he immediately took the disc\nout and did not use it again. MC 2 does not, however, apply to the adult-content\nmaterial aspect of the May 2006 incident. \nThe third MC does not apply to either aspect of the May 2006 incident. Although\nApplicant\u2019s introduction of the \u201chacker tools\u201d onto the government computer was\nunintentional or inadvertent, he did not report that matter after receiving the alarm.\nLikewise, the adult-content material aspect does not qualify for mitigation under the\nplain language of this MC. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the mitigating and disqualifying conditions). \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 10. \n20\n DC 6 is the \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a\n21\ncondition of employment.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 11. \n22\n7\nUnder Guideline E,  the security concern is that \u201cconduct involving questionable\n19\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d20\nThe record evidence raises a security concern under Guideline E, because\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of a government computer violated a briefing he had signed when he\nwas given access to the computer and that he introduced software onto the computer\nwithout having it approved by the company program office (Exhibit 3 at 2). Given these\ncircumstances, his misuse falls within the meaning of DC 6.  This raises a security\n21\nconcern and may be disqualifying because it calls into question Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E has several mitigating conditions, but the only pertinent one is MC 3,\nwhich provides as follows:\n[T]he offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.22\nMC 3 applies because, as explained above under the Guideline M discussion, his\nmisuse is minor in the scheme of things and it no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The record evidence shows Applicant\nreceived the equivalent of a slap-on-the-wrist for the misuse and was allowed to return\nto the government facility where he remained until he started his new job in October\n2006. \nThis case has also been considered under the whole-person concept, as the\nrecord evidence is both disqualifying and mitigating. Applicant is 52 years old and\nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his conduct at the work place.\nOverall, his misuse of the government computer was relatively minor. The \u201chacker tools\u201d\naspect of the May 2006 incident was a sloppy mistake, but also an honest mistake\nmade without malice. The adult-content material aspect of the May 2006 incident was\nnot an honest mistake, and Applicant admits he was wrong. The record evidence\nshows, however, that his actions in this regard did not involve nudity or sexually-explicit\n\n8\nmaterial, which would be considered a major or serious transgression. On this basis, it\nis mitigated. In addition, Applicant has approximately 20 years of work history in the\ndefense industry, and his recent performance reviews establish that Applicant is a\nhighly competent employee working in a highly technical field (Exhibits A\u2013D). Based on\nthis record, it appears the May 2006 incident is the only adverse information concerning\nApplicant. This circumstance suggests that Applicant has, on balance, the requisite self-\ncontrol, good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to properly handle and\nsafeguard classified information. Finally, based on his testimony and demeanor during\nthe hearing, Applicant appeared to be contrite. Accordingly, the likelihood of\ncontinuance or recurrence of similar conduct is assessed as remote if not nil. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\nApplicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns under both guidelines. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 27, 2006. On \nOctober 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines G, J, and H. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 2, 2009; answered it on December 11, \n2009; and requested an administrative determination on the record without a hearing. \nOn January 19, 2010, Department Counsel requested a hearing. (Tr. 24.) Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on February 25, 2010, and the case was assigned to me \non March 8, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 17, 2010, scheduling the \nhearing for April 14, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, but \npresented no witnesses or documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 22, \n2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. \nHe admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d in part and denied it in part. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f, 2.a, \n2.b, 3.a, and 3.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old welder employed by a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since 1983 and held a security clearance since \nFebruary 1985. He submitted his security clearance application in November 2006 to \ncontinue his access to classified information.  \n \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in 1979, and his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended. (GX 1 at 4.) He told a security investigator he was \narrested for DUI on three other occasions before he began working for his current \nemployer, but he could not remember the dates. (GX 3 at 1; Tr. 44.) \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery on his \ntwo children. The charges arose after he slapped his daughter, then 16 years old, \nbecause he suspected her of shoplifting and she denied it. (Tr. 30.) His son, then 18 \nyears old, came to the defense of his sister, and an altercation ensued between \nApplicant and his son. Applicant testified he had been drinking before this incident but \nwas not intoxicated. (Tr. 49.) He spent three days in jail before the charges were \ndisposed of by nolle prosequi. (GX 3 at 2-3; GX 5 at 1-4.) \n \nIn the summer of 2006, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication at a fashion \nshow. He was held in jail for about six hours and released on his own recognizance. He \npleaded guilty and paid a $15 fine. (GX 3 at 4; GX 5 at 15-16.) \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2007 for (1) disregarding a law enforcement \ncommand or eluding (a felony), (2) driving while intoxicated, (3) refusing to take a blood \nor breath test, and (4) reckless driving. After the first charge was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor, he pleaded guilty to the first two charges. He was sentenced to 180 days \nin jail (suspended), placed on probation for one year, ordered to attend a 16-week \nAlcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and fined. His driver\u2019s license was suspended \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor 12 months. The blood-test refusal was disposed of by nolle prosequi, and the \nreckless driving charge was dismissed. (GX 5 at 5-12; Tr. 54-56.)  \n \nDuring intake processing for the ASAP program, Applicant was diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence and cannabis abuse. The record does not reflect the medical \ncredentials of the person making the diagnosis. The ASAP records reflect the names of \nthe individuals involved in Applicant\u2019s treatment, followed by initials \u201cCM\u201d and \u201cBSW,\u201d \nbut those abbreviations are not defined. Applicant attended all the counseling sessions \nand attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings during his treatment period. (Tr. 37.) His \nprognosis upon discharge from the program was \u201cgood.\u201d (GX 4 at 1, 4.) \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in June 2007, stating that he \ncurrently used controlled substances and intended to continue using them. (GX 2 at 2.) \nWhen asked to identify the controlled substance he used, he listed his prescription \ndrugs for arthritis and back pain. His response indicates that he did not understand that \nthe inquiry pertained to his use of marijuana, not his lawful use of prescription drugs. His \nresponse to SOR \u00b6 3.b, alleging that he was treated for cannabis abuse, indicates that \nhe also misunderstood this allegation, because he responded to it by admitting that he \nused prescription drugs for chronic arthritis and back pain.  \n \nOn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana \nfour times in July 2005, and he commented that he was enrolling in a drug treatment \nprogram. (GX 1 at 5.) In his response to SOR \u00b6 3.c, alleging use of marijuana after \nreceiving a security clearance, he stated he used it only once a year, had not used it for \ntwo years, and did not intend to use it again. At the hearing, he testified that he had \nsmoked marijuana with other family members on special occasions, but that he does \nnot like marijuana and does not intend to use it in the future. (Tr. 58, 61.) He denied \nhaving a \u201cmarijuana problem.\u201d (Tr. 57.) \n \nApplicant was arrested in July 2007 for assault and battery on his daughter\u2019s \nboyfriend. This arrest occurred shortly after he responded to the DOHA interrogatories \nbut before he began his ASAP counseling. Applicant testified that he had been drinking \nbefore this incident. He could not remember what caused the altercation. (Tr. 50.) The \ncharges were disposed of by nolle prosequi at the request of the victim. (GX 5 at 13-14; \nTr. 49-51.) \n \nApplicant testified he found the ASAP counseling helpful, and he believes he has \nchanged as a result of it. He and his wife have a better relationship, and his family has \ngrown closer. (Tr. 37-38.) \n \nApplicant attributed his violent behavior and substance abuse between 2005 and \n2007 to family stress. His spouse was working outside the home and he was working a \nshift that left his two children unsupervised after they came home from school. (Answer \nto SOR; Tr. 30-31, 48-50.) After the 2007 incident, he changed his work schedule to \nallow more time with his family. His son is now an adult living away from home. His \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndaughter apparently is behaving responsibly and is about to graduate from a community \ncollege. (Tr. 37, 41-42.) \n \nApplicant testified that he does not drink every day, but when he drinks he \nconsumes three to six beers a day. He testified that the frequency and amount of his \ndrinking depends on his mood. He drinks only at home to avoid the risk of DUI arrests. \n(Tr. 63-65.) He works nights and holidays because he stays out of trouble when he is \nworking. (Tr. 62.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, \u201cat times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication,\u201d from about 1979 to at least October 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he was \narrested for DUI in 1979 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he was arrested in 2006 for public intoxication \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); he was arrested for several offenses, including DUI, in June 2007 and \npleaded guilty (SOR \u00b6 1.d); he was treated for alcohol dependence from August 2007 to \nNovember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he continued to consume alcohol after his treatment \nfor alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, establish all these allegations.  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d The evidence raises the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual \nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol \nabuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d by \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence \nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program,\u201d or by \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d), (e), and (f). Although \nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent upon his entry into ASAP counseling, \nthese three disqualifying conditions are not established because the evidence does not \nestablish the credentials of the person who diagnosed Applicant. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was \nrecent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If \nthe evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, almost three years had passed since Applicant\u2019s last \nalcohol-related arrest. Three years is a \u201csignificant period of time.\u201d However, Applicant \nhas continued to consume alcohol, sometimes to excess and to the point of intoxication, \nand he has no intention of stopping. He admitted at the hearing that he had an \u201calcohol \nproblem\u201d in the past, but he believes it has been resolved. He has wisely confined his \nalcohol consumption to his home. He has learned to avoid detection, but I am not \nconvinced that he is rehabilitated. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant has \nacknowledged his past alcohol problems, and successfully completed a 16-week \ncounseling program. He admits that he has not abstained from alcohol use since \ncompleting the ASAP counseling. He contends that he has moderated his consumption, \nbut he admits he regularly consumes three to six beers a day, depending on his mood. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. \n \n \nFinally, AG \u00b6 23(d) provides that security concerns under this guideline may be \nmitigated if -- \n \nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nI conclude that AG \u00b6 23(d) is not established. Although Applicant successfully \ncompleted the ASAP counseling and received a favorable prognosis upon discharge, \nthe credentials of the person making the prognosis are not reflected in the record. \nFurthermore, Applicant has not abstained from alcohol or established a pattern of \nmodified consumption since completing the program. \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was arrested for two counts of assault and battery on \na family member in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and arrested in July 2007 for assault and battery \non his daughter\u2019s boyfriend (SOR \u00b6 2.b). These allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the corroborating evidence. The alcohol-related arrests \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were not cross-alleged under this guideline. \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s arrests for assaulting his children in 2005 and his \ndaughter\u2019s boyfriend in 2007 are sufficient to raise two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 \n31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s \nassault on his children was five years ago and the assault on his daughter\u2019s boyfriend \nwas three years ago. There is no evidence of violent behavior before or after these two \nincidents. He has changed his work schedule to allow more time with his family, thereby \nremoving a major source of family tension. His son is an adult, living away from home. \nHis daughter apparently has matured and is about to graduate from a community \ncollege. I am satisfied that further violent behavior is unlikely. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n\n \n8 \n \n \n32(d). Applicant has expressed remorse and has not been involved in further acts of \nviolence. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(d) is established.  \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from July \n2005 to at least July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.a), received treatment for cannabis abuse from \nAugust 2007 to November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.b), and used marijuana after being granted a \nsecurity clearance (SOR \u00b6 3.c). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c, and his \nadmissions are corroborated by the evidence.  \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 3.b, and he testified that his treatment was only for \nalcohol abuse, not illegal drug use. His testimony is plausible, because the program was \nnamed \u201cAlcohol Safety Action Program.\u201d I conclude that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c are \nsupported by substantial evidence, but SOR \u00b6 3.b is not. I resolve SOR \u00b6 3.b in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. Guideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1).  \n \nThe evidence raises the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(h) (expressed intent to continue illegal drug use) is not raised by \nApplicant\u2019s declaration, in response to DOHA interrogatories, that he intended to \ncontinue using controlled substances. I am satisfied he was referring to his prescription \ndrugs for arthritis and back pain when he stated that he intended to continue using \ncontrolled substances. He testified at the hearing that he did not enjoy marijuana and \ndid not intend to use it again. Although AG \u00b6 26(h) is not raised, the evidence raising \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g) shifted the burden to Applicant to explain, refute, or mitigate \nthe facts. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was \ninfrequent, and it last occurred more than two years ago. However, his use of marijuana \nwhile holding a clearance was a serious breach of trust that casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \nestablished.  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was \nwith family members. Although he has not disassociated himself from his family, he has \ndecided to avoid family gatherings at which marijuana use is likely, and he has \nabstained from marijuana use for more than two years. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(2) \nand 26(b)(3) are established, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(4) are not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because the ASAP counseling was focused on alcohol use rather than drug \nuse, and Applicant\u2019s favorable prognosis was from a person of unknown medical \ncredentials.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncomments under Guidelines G, J, and H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with a long record of service as a contractor \nemployee. He has held a clearance for about 25 years. He was granted a clearance \nnotwithstanding his early alcohol-related criminal conduct, but he violated the trust \nplaced in him by the Government when he used marijuana while holding a clearance. \nHe has decided to continue consuming alcohol, in a quantity and frequency determined \nby his moods, notwithstanding his history of alcohol problems. He has been under the \npressure of retaining his clearance since November 2006, when he submitted his \ncurrent application. He has opted to avoid detection by drinking at home. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, J, \nand H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption and drug \ninvolvement. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines C and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 1, 2007, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on November 20, 2007. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant on November 28, 2007, and it was received on December 3, 2007. \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation of the allegations. Applicant did not object to the FORM and \ndid not submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on January 28, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with comments. They are \nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old architect who has worked for a federal contractor since \n2004. He was born in the U.S. in 1977 to Nigerian parents. In 1981 he moved to Nigeria \nwith his parents. He remained in Nigeria where he was educated until he completed \nhigh school in 1996. He returned to the U.S. in 1996 and attended college where he \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in architect in 2001. He returned to Nigeria in December \n2002 and August 2003 to visit his family. \n \n \nApplicant applied for and was issued a Nigeria passport on December 27, 2002. \nThe passport was to expire on December 27, 2007. Applicant provided a statement in \nhis answer that he did not intend to renew it.1 He traveled to Nigeria and used his \nNigerian passport on the two occasions he returned there. He used his Nigerian \npassport for convenience and so he would not have to obtain a visa from the Nigerian \ngovernment. Applicant is a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States.2 It is unclear if \nApplicant is willing to renounce his dual citizenship status. In a result of interview \ndocument it appears he is willing to renounce his passport and dual citizenship status \nshould it be requested or required.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Nigeria. He is employed as an \nengineer for the state-run housing department. In June 2007, Applicant filed an \nimmigrant petition for his father to reside in the U.S. No subsequent information was \nprovided to update the status of that petition. The petition is merely an application and it \ndoes not grant any immigration status nor guarantee that the alien will subsequently be \neligible for a visa.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria currently residing in \nthe U.S. She is retired from the Nigerian Water Company as an accountant. No \ninformation was provided as to what income she subsists on or whether she receives \nany benefits or pension from the Nigerian government or the Nigerian Water Company.  \n \n \n1 Item 2. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. at 2. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nAdministrative notice is taken of the facts about Nigeria described in the \ngovernment\u2019s FORM. Four of the six source documents included in the FORM are \nreports by the U.S. Department of State, the fifth document is from the Congressional \nResearch Service, and the sixth document is a United Nations map of Nigeria.4 The \nfollowing facts about Nigeria are highlighted.  \n \n\u2022 Nigeria is a federal republic in western Africa. Since gaining independence from \nthe British in 1960, Nigeria has experienced periods of political instability. In \n1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule after years of military rule. \n\u2022 The Nigerian government\u2019s record on human rights is poor.  \n\u2022 Violent crime, committed by ordinary criminals as well as by persons in police \nand military uniforms, can occur throughout the country. Kidnapping for ransom \nof persons associated with the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens, \nremains common in the Niger Delta region.  \n\u2022 A travel warning issued in October 2007 warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of \ntravel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of the security situation in the Niger \nDelta region.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n4 Items 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: When an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport\u2026 (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, \nor other such benefits from a foreign country\u201d) and (b) (\u201caction to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d). Applicant was a U.S. \ncitizen when he applied for and was granted a Nigerian passport, based on his dual \ncitizenship status in that country. He then used that Nigerian passport on two occasions \nto enter Nigeria. He did so for his convenience and so he would not have to obtain a \nvisa. The facts raise both these disqualifying conditions.  \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable under this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 \ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\u201d); (c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of \nforeign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nindividual was a minor\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated\u201d). Applicant is a dual citizen of \nNigeria and the U.S. Although his duality was originally based on his parents\u2019 \ncitizenship, he obtained a Nigerian passport and used it when he became an adult, thus \nexercising his Nigerian citizenship. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not \nbased solely on his parent\u2019s citizenship. Therefore, mitigating condition (a) and (c) do \nnot apply.  \nApplicant has expressed a \u201cqualified\u201d willingness to renounce his dual citizenship \nand give up his passport if it was requested or required. I find this qualified renunciation \ndoes not fall within the parameters of (b) and does not apply. Applicant\u2019s passport was \nto expire on December 27, 2007. Although Applicant expressed his intention not to \nrenew it at the time he provided his answer to the SOR, no subsequent information was \nprovided by him as to its status after its impending expiration or whether he changed his \nmind and did renew it. There was also no information provided whether he surrendered \nit, destroyed it, or otherwise invalidated it. Hence, I find (e) does not apply.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7. I have \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d). Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of \nNigeria and works for its government. His mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and \nNigeria. It is unknown if she receives a pension or subsidy from the Nigerian \ngovernment or the Nigerian company she worked for before retirement. I find this \ndisqualifying condition applies.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions for this security concern under \nAG \u00b6 8 and especially considered (a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationship with foreign \npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization and interests of the U.S.\u201d), (b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \n\n \n6 \n \n \nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests\u201d), and (c) (\u201ccontact or communication \nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Nigeria is a country that has \nconsiderable internal strife, human rights difficulties, and a turbulent criminal element. \nAmericans are warned of the dangers of traveling in the country due to the turmoil and \nrisk to their safely. Applicant failed to provide sufficient information about his relationship \nwith his father, who is a citizen and resident of Nigeria. It is presumed it is a close \nrelationship because he is sponsoring his father for admission to the U.S. Applicant \nfailed to provide any other amplifying information about his father\u2019s work, relationship \nwith the Nigerian government, whether he will receive a pension when he retires, and \ninformation as to any other contacts he may have. He failed to provide similar \ninformation about his mother. No information was provided as to how much contact he \nhas with either his father or mother. Applicant lived most of his life in Nigeria and is a \ndual citizen. There is insufficient information to determine if there is a conflict of interests \nand if there was if it would be resolved in favor of the U.S. The facts provided do not \nsupport application of mitigating conditions (b) or (c).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a dual citizen of Nigeria \nand the U.S. He applied for a Nigerian passport after he was a U.S. citizen. He failed to \nprovide information as to the current status of his passport, so it could not be \ndetermined whether it was destroyed, surrendered, invalidated, or, in fact, renewed. His \nfather is a Nigerian citizen and resident who is employed by the government. No other \ninformation was provided. Applicant has submitted immigration papers for his father to \ncome to the U.S., but no information was provided as to whether they were approved. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant did not provide enough information to meet his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline C, \nforeign preference, and Guideline B, foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 25, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on November 19, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 26, 2007, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on December 13, 2007. During the hearing, I received four Government\nexhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 12, 2007. Based upon a review of the\n\n2\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations except subparagraph\n1.e.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old, married man with six children ranging in age from four\nto eighteen. The three oldest children live with their mother, his ex-wife. The younger\nthree children with Applicant and their mother, his current wife. He has been married to\nhis current wife since 2003. \nApplicant has a high school education, and has taken some college courses. He\nworks as an electronics technician for a defense contractor. His job duties include\ntesting military equipment. (Exhibit 1 at 2). He has been in this line of work for\napproximately 14 years.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. His supervisor characterizes him as one\nof the most trustworthy individuals he had ever met. (Tr. 59). Applicant frequently works\novertime to complete assigned projects. (Exhibit A).\nIn 1997, Applicant quit his job, and started a wine wholesale business. (Tr. 39).\nShortly thereafter, he sold that business and opened a liquor store. (Tr. 48). His\nbusiness was unsuccessful, prompting him to dissolve it in 1999. At or about the same\ntime his business was struggling, his first marriage was disintegrating. He and his first\nwife divorced in 1998.\nApplicant returned to his electronics technician job in 2000. Between 2000 and\n2002, he experienced a series of layoffs that collectively resulted in three months\nwithout income. (Tr.49). By 2007, he had accrued nine delinquencies in the approximate\namount of $10,900. \nSOR subparagraph 1.a is a medical bill. He satisfied it in July 2007. (Exhibit 4 at\n7). SOR subparagraph 1.b is a late monthly membership fee owed to a health club to\nwhich Applicant belonged in 2000. The health club continued to bill him after he\ninformed them he was terminating his membership contract. Later that year, when\nApplicant discovered this debt on his credit report, he attempted to contact the club to\ndispute the charge, and discovered that it had gone out of business (Tr. 23). In July\n2007, after discovering it was on his credit report, he wrote the credit reporting agency,\nand informed it of the dispute. (Exhibit 4 at 3).\n\nCompare the matching account numbers in the November 2005 credit report (Exhibit 2 at 4), the\n1\nSeptember 2007 credit report (Exhibit 3 at 7), and the December 2007 credit report (Exhibit D at 1 and 2).\nCompare the matching account numbers in the November 2005 credit report (Exhibit 2 at 4) and the\n2\nSeptember 2007 credit report (Exhibit 3 at 2).\n3\nSOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.i are duplicates.  Applicant researched this debt,\n1\nand discovered the creditor was an automobile insurance underwriter. (Tr. 24). He then\ndisputed it, and notified, in writing, his credit reporting agency of the dispute. (Exhibit 4\nat 3). The dispute has not yet been resolved.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e are duplicates.  In approximately 1998,\n2\nApplicant financed the purchase of a truck. (Tr. 29). It was repossessed in 2001 after his\npayments grew delinquent. After the truck was resold, the deficiency note was assigned\nto another creditor. (Tr. 25). Applicant never received notice of assignment, and did not\nknow a deficiency existed until he discovered the debt on his credit report when he\nattempted to buy another car. (Tr. 31). In July 2007, he wrote the current creditor\nrequesting information validating its status as the current holder of the deficiency note.\n(Exhibit 4 at 3). He will not pay the creditor until he verifies it is the appropriate payee.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g are delinquencies owed to the same creditor.\n(Tr. 32). Applicant does not recognize the creditor. He has left three phone messages in\nan effort to identify and resolve the bills, and has not received a response. (Tr. 32, 33).\nThe creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h is a collection agent for a phone\ncompany. (Exhibit 4 at 10). In October 2006, Applicant negotiated a settlement. (Exhibit\n4 at 11), and he satisfied it two months later. (Exhibit 4 at 12, Copy of Cancelled\nCheck).\nSOR subparagraph 1.j is a delinquent home utility bill, and SOR subparagraph\n1.k is a delinquent utility bill from his failed business. (Tr. 38). In July 2007, Applicant\nentered an agreement to satisfy these debts through electronic monthly payments. (Tr.\n41, Exhibit B). By October 2007, he had satisfied both. (Tr. 41). \nApplicant owns a home and two automobiles. (Tr. 42). He purchased the home\nthree years ago. He satisfied the car note on one car in 2004 (Tr. 54), and is current on\nboth his mortgage and the remaining car note.\nIn response to Government interrogatories, Applicant, in July 2007, submitted a\nbudget. (Exhibit 4 at 13). Currently, he has approximately $200 of monthly, remaining,\nafter-expense income.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nHere, Applicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b619(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s divorce and business failure both occurred in the late 1990s. These\nunfortunate circumstances were followed by a series of layoffs between 2000 and 2002.\nCollectively, these problems significantly contributed to his subsequent financial\nindebtedness. Since 2006, he has been resolving his delinquencies by either satisfying\nthem in their entirety, or arranging settlement plans. The only unresolved ones are\neither those whose respective creditors he has been unable to contact, or those that he\nhas disputed. With respect to the disputed debts, he wrote the credit reporting agency in\nJuly 2007, and provided a comprehensive outline of the basis of each dispute\nAlthough the unresolved delinquencies include an automobile deficiency, the\nlargest listed in the SOR, I conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation for not yet satisfying it was\nreasonable given his credibility displayed at the hearing, the cause of his indebtedness,\nand the good-faith manner in which he has been attempting to resolve it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201c. . . . there are clear indications that the problem is\nunder control,\u201d 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis\nto dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and . . .\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d apply. Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n6\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by circumstances beyond his control.\nNone were reflective of any extravagant spending. Since 2006, he has been\nmethodically resolving them. His financial management skills appear significantly\ncompetent enough for him to successfully incorporate additional debt payments into his\nbudget if the credit reporting agency concludes he must pay the disputed creditors.\nEvaluating this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude he has mitigated\nthe financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2007, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on October 23, 2007. Applicant received a complete file\nof relevant material (FORM) on October 30, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s\nFebruary 12, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, dated September 11, 2007).\n2\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated March 2005).\n3\nId.\n4\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s Affidavit, signed January 31, 2006).\n5\nId.\n6\nThe total outstanding debt is likely more because allegation 1.d lists a debt of $7,008 which is the past\n7\ndue portion. The charged off debt for this account was approximately $15,000. This additional amount, as\nshown on the 2007 credit report, brings his total delinquent debt to $42,571. \n2\ncase.  Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on\n1\nJanuary 28, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 19, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegation\nin \u00b6 1.e of the SOR.  \n2\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He worked as a\ndesign manager from 1989 until 2000. He is married and has two children. He has\nworked for his current employer since December 2003.3\nApplicant had his own business for several years.  However, in 1999 his\n4\nbusiness began to fail. His debt occurred from 1999 until 2002 because he tried to keep\nthe business in operation with his own funds.  He was forced to close his business in\n5\nAugust 2002. He was unable to pay his business debts.\nApplicant experienced no difficulty finding employment after the close of his\nbusiness. He has been steadily employed for the past five years. His spouse had been\nemployed on a part time basis in 2002 and most recently on a full time basis in 2007.\nHe elected to pay the college tuition for his children rather than pay his delinquent debt.6\nThe debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $35,000.  Applicant admits the\n7\ndebts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. He claims that he made payments in 2007 on four of the\naccounts. However, he provided no evidence or documentation to support the claim.\nThe charged off accounts remain on his 2007 credit report. Applicant also reported that\nhe is \u201cwaiting for settlement\u201d figures on the debts in 1.b, 1.c and 1.d of the SOR. He has\nnot paid on the fifth debt (1.e) because it is \u201ccontested.\u201d The debt in 1.a is admitted but\nthen disputed because he claims all his medical bills are paid. The account in 1.a is for\na medical bill. At the same time, Applicant disputed the debt but there is nothing in the\n\nItem 6 (Applicant\u2019s Response to DOHA Interrogatory, dated June 26, 2007).\n8\nId.\n9\n3\nrecord to support either a payment or the dispute.  In addition, Applicant disputed debt\n8\n1.e based on high interest charges.\nIn 2005, Applicant listed his substantial debts on his security clearance\napplication. On that March 2005 application, he remarked that he had every intention of\npaying his delinquent obligations. He further explained he began a debt management\nprogram through an Employee Assistance Program at work and would pay off his debt\nin 2006. However, there is no record of this financial plan in 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s current employment is stable and provides a steady income. Since\n2002 he has been gainfully employed. His net monthly income in June 2007 was\n$4,450. He has a monthly net remainder of $800. He notes that he is trying to pay back\nhis creditors while providing for his family. However, he is waiting for settlement figures\nfrom three of the debts as discussed above. His June 2007 personal financial statement\nlists his monthly expenses including \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d but does not list any scheduled or\nreported payments\u2013 it affirms \u201cwaiting for settlements to be arranged.\u201d  \n9\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling according to his answer to\nthe SOR. Although he did mention in 2005 that he began a program through his work,\nbut there is nothing in the record to support this claim. He did not contact his creditors to\narrange any settlements or even small payments on any of the delinquent accounts.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to\npay some obligations for a period of time. His credit reports confirm that he has not paid\nthe charged off collection accounts. The activity for the delinquent debts ranges from\n\n5\n2001 until the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 2001 and 2003. He accumulated some\ndelinquent debt due to his failed business venture. While that situation may have\nprecipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. The Applicant\u2019s problems\nhave been ongoing and he has not resolved the significant delinquent debts. His\ninaction after being employed raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from his downturn and the ultimate close of his business.\nHowever, he did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving his delinquent debts. He\ndid not set up a plan to repay on a systematic basis. His spouse returned to work and\nApplicant chose to pay college tuition instead of his delinquent debt. I find this\npotentially mitigating condition does not fully apply in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has not resolved\nthe delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He presented no evidence or\ndocumentation to support payment on any of his debts. He is now financially sound and\nprepared for future contingencies. He allowed his numerous debts to remain unpaid for\na period of several years despite his increasing income. In 2007, he promised to pay off\n\u201call adverse credit\u201d but he has not done so. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant disputed the first debt\nof $100 (medical account). He did not produce any documentation to support this claim.\nHis statements are inconsistent. As to the debt in 1.e, he disputes it because the\ninterest charges are high. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s career and employment\nsituation was apparently fine until his business venture in 2000. His financial difficulty\nbegan when the business declined and his revenue did not match his business bills.\nDue to the downturn and eventual demise of his business venture in August 2002, he\naccumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond his control. However, he did find\nemployment in 2002 and his wife started to work part time. She is now working full time.\nApplicant has been with his current employer since December 2003. His income has\nincreased and he now has a positive monthly net remainder. Despite this substantial\nimprovement in finances, Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances\nbecause once he had stable employment he did not start paying his delinquent debt. He\nstill has the delinquent debt. He provided no documentation to support his claim that he\nis paying on some of the debts. He did however, elect to pay the college tuition for his\ntwo children. Even if Applicant could not pay the entire debt, he could have made some\neffort to set up a payment plan. However, he has not taken affirmative action to pay or\nresolve most of the delinquent debts, raising concerns about his good judgment. Of\ncourse, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant\nhas not shown sufficient effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He has not met his\nburden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The SOR informed Applicant that based on available information DOHA \nadjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her access to classified information and submitted the case to an \nadministrative judge for a security determination.1 On August 8, 2007, Applicant answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007. On October 4, 2007, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing on October 24, 2007. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The government presented 13 exhibits, marked GE 1-13, to support the SOR. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and presented no other evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 2, 2007. \n \n \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES \n \nOn September 27, 2007, the Government moved to amend the SOR by adding two \nallegations under Guideline F.2 Applicant objected to the amendment, and I denied the motion \n(Tr. 14-18, 111). \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, g, h, l, t, u, v, w, x, y, aa, bb, cc, and dd with \nexplanations.

On August 30, 2006, the \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense \n(DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which \nthe SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n2  The Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR was marked as Appellate Exhibit 1 and made part of the \nrecord.  \n\n                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nFebruary 2003, Applicant was hired by another Government agency and submitted a security \nclearance application (GE 2).4 In August 2003 and in 2004, she was confronted about her \nfinancial problems and asked to resolve them. She failed to do so. In February 2006, she was \nfired due to her unresolved credit issues (Tr. 106-107). \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and included the \nreview of five credit bureau reports (CBR) dating from April 2003 to September 2007.5 \nApplicant stated her financial problems started around the late 1990s because she was \nunemployed and/or underemployed.  \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant explained she has been using her credit cards to pay for her \nday-to-day living expenses, and for buying presents for her kids. She used her credit and opened \naccounts knowing she would not be able to repay the charges. Applicant claimed she has not \nbeen able to pay most of her delinquent debts because she has never earned enough to pay for her \nday-to-day living expenses and her old debts. She stated her willingness to pay her delinquent \ndebts as soon as she earns enough money to do so. She also intends to file for bankruptcy \nprotection to resolve her bad debts. Two weeks before her hearing, Applicant made inquiries \nabout how to file for bankruptcy. However, as of the hearing day, she had not filed for \nbankruptcy protection (Tr. 50).  \n  \nThe SOR alleges 29 delinquent/charged off accounts. Applicant averred, and the \nGovernment conceded, that the following SOR allegations were duplicated (originated from the \nsame debt, but were in collection by subsequent creditors and/or debt collectors): \u00b61.a and 1.s; \n1.b and 1.o and 1.p; 1.g and 1.cc; and 1.h and 1.k.  \n \nThe debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w, totalling approximately $10,000, were for \nstudent loans that Applicant took during the mid-1980s. She consolidated the three student loan \ndebts pursuant to a payment plan around 2004. However, Applicant has defaulted twice on her \npayment arrangements due to lack of funds. On the last occasion, two of her checks were \nreturned for lack of funds and the creditor placed the account on default. Sometime before her \nhearing, she started making payments again. The account will be removed from its default status \nwhen she pays $1,000.  \n \n \nAs of the hearing date, Applicant had 20 delinquent/charged off debts, totaling \napproximately $33,626, that are supported by the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant confirmed \nmost of the debts are her debts, and that they are still outstanding because of her lack of income. \nShe denied some of her debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, f, and q) because they were removed from her latest CBR. \nApplicant admitted, however, she did not pay the debts. Applicant paid the debts alleged in SOR \n \n \n3  GE 3 (Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing, certified on Sep. 7, 2006 and \nDec. 15, 2006). \n \n4  GE 2 (Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P). \n \n5  GE 5 through GE 10. \n \n\n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\n\u00b6 1.i, 1.d (the same debt was alleged under 1.e), and 1.m.6 She claimed she paid SOR \u00b6 1.c; \nhowever, she presented no evidence to corroborate her claim.  \n \nApplicant claimed that around October-December 2006, she wrote letters to all of her \ncreditors asking them to allow her to enter into payment arrangements. She claimed none of the \ncreditors responded to her letters. When asked for copies of her letters, she responded she had \nthem in her computer at work. She also claimed that twice previously she attempted to \nconsolidate her debts with two different financial counseling/consolidation services. She \npresented no evidence to corroborate her claims. Applicant was allowed additional time to \nsubmit information post-hearing to support her claims. She failed to do so. Applicant presented \nlittle evidence of efforts taken to pay or otherwise resolve her debts since the day she acquired \nthem.  \n \nApplicant claimed mitigating circumstances that prevented her from paying her debts, \ni.e., periods of unemployment, underemployment, and lack of child support. She presented no \nevidence, other than her testimony, to corroborate her claims. Applicant presented no evidence of \nany measures she has taken to avoid future financial difficulties. She claimed she did not seek \nfinancial counseling because she does not have the resources to do so. At her hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that her financial problems were the result of her financial mismanagement (Tr. 119). \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the Disqualifying and \nMitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances \nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The \npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a \nconclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial \ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,7 and the whole \nperson concept.8 Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) is the applicable relevant adjudicative guideline. \n                                                          \n6  GEs 7-10. \n \n7  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and \nadjudication policy . . .\u201d \n \n8  Directive \u00b6 2(a). \u201cThe adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \nwhole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \nthe extent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d \n \n\n                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\nBURDEN OF PROOF \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.9 The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial \nevidence.10 The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the \nultimate burden of persuasion.11  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling \ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.12 \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the government\u2019s concern is that an \nApplicant\u2019s failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations dating back to the late \n1990s. Since then, she has accumulated at least 20 delinquent/charged off debts and/or \njudgments totaling approximately $33,626. The majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts \ncould be considered small debts (for less than $1,000); however, they have been delinquent for \nmany years. In 2003 and 2004, Applicant was confronted about her financial problems by her \nthen employer. Applicant failed to resolve her financial problems and was fired from her \nemployment. As of the day of her hearing, Applicant still had substantially the same debts that \ncaused her to be fired. She presented little evidence to show she has been diligent taking action \nto resolve her debts. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability \n                                                          \n9  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n10  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but \nless than a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of \nall the contrary evidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n \n11  Egan, supra n.9, at 528, 531. \n \n12  See id; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,13 I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact creditors, or to \nresolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any evidence that she has \nparticipated in any financial counseling. I specifically considered Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition (FC MC) Guidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony fails to establish mitigating factors that may be \nconsidered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts. \nShe was unemployed for one month, underemployed, and she may have received sporadic child \nsupport. These claims demonstrate circumstances beyond her control; however, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with her financial obligations. She \npresented little evidence to show she dealt responsibly with her financial obligations even after \nconfronted by her prior employer about her financial problems. She presented little evidence of \npaid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, and of financial \nassistance/counseling received. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence \npreclude a finding that she has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she \nhas taken control of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, her financial \nproblems are likely to continue. Moreover, her financial problems are recent, not isolated, and \nongoing.  \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the whole person \nconcept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, maturity, her years working for a \ndefense contractor, and her demeanor and testimony. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of her \nfinancial affairs. She has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by her overall behavior.  \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, b, c, f, g, j, h, \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \n j, n, q, r, z, l, t, u, v, w, x, y, aa, bb, and dd \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, e, i, k, m, o, p, s, cc \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                          \n13  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On April\n22, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had 15 delinquent debts totaling approximately $19,000.  At\nthe time the case was submitted for decision, she was paying on only one of the debts.  Decision at\n1-2.  Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant had deliberately falsified her security clearance\napplication when in response to the question as to whether she had debts that had been delinquent\nmore than 90 days and more than 180 days respectively, she answered \u201cno.\u201d  The Judge noted that\nin her response to the SOR, Applicant had stated that she was so consumed with shame concerning\nher financial situation that she failed to disclose her debts.  Id. at 2-3.\nOn appeal, Applicant requests that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline F be\nreversed because her financial problems had resulted from a period of underemployment after she\nhad left the military.  She asks that the adverse decision under Guideline E be reversed based on her\nfavorable character references and military service.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR\nallegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board\ndoes not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

(Item 5) In \nJune 2007, Applicant had a job promotion and a 70% pay raise to $25.11 per hour. She \nwas expecting another pay raise in October 2007. (Item 5) \n \nIn December 2006, Applicant had to purchase a vehicle when her vehicle \nexperienced engine trouble. (Item 5) This unexpected event had an impact on her \nfinances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.3 \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial \nobligations. \n \n \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has \nsignificant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial \nobligations. Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly safeguarding and \n \n3 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n5\nhandling classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of \nlife provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes approximately $19,000 on 15 debts. Disqualifying conditions \nAG\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG\u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nIn January 2005, Applicant\u2019s monthly income was greatly reduced when she left \nthe Air Force. She had a series of low paying job before securing her current job. Her \nincome paid her living expenses, but was insufficient for payment on her other debts. \nOther than repayment on her government debt, Applicant has not paid any of the other \n14 debts. Even though interviewed about her delinquent debts in October 2006, \nanswering financial interrogatories in July 2007, and receiving the SOR in October \n2007, five months ago, she had not made a single payment on any of her other debts.  \n \n \nMitigating condition AG\u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, has limited applicability. After \nleaving the Air Force her income was greatly reduced, but this was not an unexpected \nevent since she chose to accept a buyout. Additionally, she has been gainfully \nemployed since April 2006 and has made payment on only one debt. Applicant has not \nacted reasonably under the circumstances. Her income may have been limited, but she \nshould have been able to establish a repayment plan with some of the creditors. \n \n \nFourteen of the debts remain unpaid. Mitigating conditions AG\u00b6 20 (a) the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, does not apply. The debts in \nquestion went unpaid starting in 2005, they are numerous, and did not incurred under \nunusual circumstances. \n \n \n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling or demonstrated \na positive change in her financial management. It is not clear the problem is being \nresolved or under control. AG\u00b6 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply nor does AG\u00b6 20 (d) \u201cthe individual initiated \na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d except for the \nrepayment of the government debt.  \n \n \nFor AG\u00b6 20 (d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling her debts is needed, which is not present here. Applicant is making payment \non her government debt and in May 2008, after this debt has been paid, she intends to \n\n \n \n \n6\nstart paying her other delinquent debts. This may or may not occur. There is no \nrepayment plan other than her statement that she will pay the debts.  \n \n \nApplicant has made few efforts to resolve the delinquent indebtedness and has \nnot made any real progress in addressing her debts. Given these circumstances, in light \nof the unaddressed delinquent debts, her efforts do not amount to a good-faith effort \nwithin the meaning of the guideline.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, the concern is conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nIn August 2006, when completing her SF 86, Applicant intentionally failed to list \nher delinquent debts in response to question 28. Due to the nature of her debts \nApplicant should have disclosed them. AG \u00b6 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal \nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d applies.  \n \nDuring her October 2006 interview, she indicated she thought she had put the \ndebts on one of the forms she completed and also said she did not believe the debts \nwere delinquent. If she did not believe her debts were delinquent she would have had \nno reason to list them on the form. I find her response to the SOR to be more credible. \nShe states she was ashamed about her financial situations and failed to disclose her \ndebts.  \n \n \n \nAdditionally, AG \u00b6 16(a) a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities, applies.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to her false answers. She did not make a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted by the facts, \nthe concealment was not caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice, or so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about \nher finances. She is paying her government obligation. After it is paid, she will start \npaying her other debts. Although her intent to resolve her financial problems appears to \nbe genuine, she has done little to demonstrate that intent. What is missing is: (1) a \nrealistic and workable plan to address her financial problems, (2) documented actions \ntaken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable improvement in the situation. \nGiven the current circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will continue. \nAdditionally, she should have given truthful answers on her SF 86 when asked about \nher finances. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise suitably addressed the obligations, she \nmay well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h-1o: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility renders her an unsuitable candidate for a security\nclearance. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 31 July 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nfinancial considerations.  Applicant answered the SOR 20 August 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\n\n2\nDOHA assigned the case to me 12 September 2007, and I convened a hearing 10 October 2007.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 17 October 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the financial allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d.,\n1.e., and 1.m. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 38-year-old\nproject manager for a defense contractor since January 2006. She has not previously held a clearance.\nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling over $13,000. Each of these debts is\ndocumented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports.

She\ntook no action to address her debts until 2006-2007, when it became clear that her delinquent debts\nmight prevent her from obtaining her clearance (Tr. 39, 57). She paid the debt at SOR 1.g. in July\n2006, and paid the debts at SOR 1.h. and 1.l. on the eve of her answer to the SOR in August 2007.\nApplicant currently has the means to satisfy her past due debts as the result of a life insurance\npayment for her husband\u2019s death in April 2006. However, she has been slow to satisfy her delinquent\naccounts because she insists that the successor-in-interest collection agents corroborate their\nentitlement to payment where she is unable to connect the original debt to the collection agent. She\npronounces herself concerned about financial fraud, and consequently is unwilling to pay creditors\nby electronic check or credit card. She reaffirms her intent to pay her past due creditors once she is\nsatisfied she owes them money.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list adjudicative factors to be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess\nboth disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts\nand circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (e)\n3\nconsistently spending beyond one\u2019s means. . . \n\u00b620. (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\n4\nis  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n3\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records document over $13,000 of delinquent debt\nthat Applicant is currently able to pay, but has largely failed to pay or establish repayment plans.  \n3\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Her debts are not due\n4\nto circumstances beyond her control, and she has not acted responsibly in addressing her debts.5\nWhile her insistence that the creditors prove their entitlement to payment might appear to be a\nprudent precaution in today\u2019s financial environment, from another angle it delays payment to\npotentially legitimate creditors because Applicant did not pay the accounts when the original\ncreditors were trying to get paid. Consequently Applicant has no repayment plans with any of the\nalleged unpaid creditors, and is unable to demonstrate that she has the problem under control.6\nFurther, Applicant has taken no verified steps to address her debts.  Even payment of the three\n7\naccounts she has paid does not ameliorate the security concerns, undertaken as they were on the eve\nof her answer to the SOR. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\n\n4\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a Guideline E, personal\nconduct security concern. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 7, 2007, admitted the allegations,\nand requested an administrative determination. On October 29, 2007, department\ncounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on October\n30, 2007, and did not reply. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. I have\nreviewed the FORM, and have concluded that eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMay 14, 2008\n\nApplicant allegedly failed to place some license plates in a the department\u2019s evidence locker.\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old married man with four children, ranging in age from six\nto 17. He earned a bachelor of science degree in computer and information sciences in\n1989. He is a private investigator and owns a limousine service. He is seeking to work\nfor a defense contractor as a background investigator.\nFrom April 1985 to February 2004, Applicant was a police officer. During that\ntime, he received a combination of 15 departmental awards and certificates for\noutstanding work (Item 2 at 2).\nFrom 1990 to 2006, Applicant operated a part-time business that among other\nthings placed police officers in part-time security guard positions at a local automobile\ndealership. (Item 5 at 4). Under his agreement with the dealership, Applicant recruited\npolice officers to work at the dealership, screened them, and managed the security\nguard payroll (Item 4 at 34).\nIn January 2003, a police officer who had used Applicant\u2019s services filed a\ncomplaint with the police department\u2019s internal affairs division (IAD) accusing Applicant\nof improperly retaining a percentage of his security guard salary. According to state\nregulations, police officers who operated security guard placement companies could\nretain as commission part of the salary of anyone they place so long as their companies\nwere licensed. Applicant\u2019s company was not licensed (Item 5 at 4). He was unaware of\nthe licensing requirement (Id.).\nThe IAD also investigated Applicant for using a subordinate to sign his leave slips\ninstead of his supervisor, and mishandling of evidence  (Item 5 at 4). During the course\n1\nof the investigation, administrative charges were filed against Applicant (Id.). While the\ninvestigation was pending, the auto dealership offered him a full-time position as its\nsecurity manager. He accepted the position in January 2004, quit his job with the police\ndepartment, and worked at the auto dealership for slightly more than two years (Item 4\nat 14). He did not resign from the police department under an agreement (Item 4 at 34). \nApplicant has never seen a copy of the IAD file (Item 2 at 1), and it is not\nincluded in the record evidence. All of the record information regarding the\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s police department resignation stems from his security\nclearance application disclosure, and his later discussion with an investigative agent. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n3\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions establish the government\u2019s allegation\nthat he left his job as a police officer in 2004 while under investigation for operation of a\njob placement business without a license, erroneous leave slip execution, and failure to\nplace evidence in an evidence locker. \nNo record evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s operation of his business without\nthe proper license was anything more than an administrative oversight. A police officer\nwho obtained a job as a part-time security guard with the help of Applicant\u2019s placement\ncompany alleged that he improperly retained part of his hourly security guard salary.\nUpon reviewing the record evidence, I conclude Applicant did nothing improper by\nretaining part of the contract security guard\u2019s salary for placing him. Instead, he erred in\nfailing to obtain a license for his job placement service.\nApplicant\u2019s contention that he was unaware of the licensing requirement was not\nchallenged in the record. Also, the government\u2019s entire case rests on information he\nvoluntarily disclosed. Under these circumstances, I conclude his contention was\ncredible.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to submit leave requests properly has limited probative value in\nassessing his security clearance worthiness absent any evidence regarding the\n\n4\nfrequency of the conduct or the circumstances under which it occurred. Similarly, no\nevidence exists to assess the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to store the license\nplates in the department\u2019s evidence locker. This oversight also has limited probative\nvalue. I conclude Applicant\u2019s erroneous leave slip execution and failure to place\nevidence in the department\u2019s evidence locker were minor administrative errors. \nBefore the IAD investigation, Applicant\u2019s career as a police officer was\nexemplary. There is no evidence of misconduct either before or after the investigation.\nConsequently, although Applicant\u2019s mistakes constitute a pattern of misconduct, they\nare not sufficient enough when combined with all of the available information to support\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment or untrustworthiness under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d), as the government alleges. Applicant has mitigated the personal\nconduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a), as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI addressed the whole person factors in the Personal Conduct section of the\ndecision. Upon considering these factors, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1b:\nFor Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts ranging from $43 to $20,198 for about $36,000 in total (excluding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t). A large part of the indebtedness is due to medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\u20131.n).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 10, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 30, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\nhearing took place as scheduled on January 29, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on February 6, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 15, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The post-\nhearing matters are marked and admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit C\u2013cover letter; (2)\nExhibit D\u2013payment history for the repayment plan; and (3) Exhibit E\u2013college transcript.\nFor the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nThe SOR was amended, without objections, to reflect Applicant\u2019s name change\nper her divorce (Exhibit B\u2013IV, V). \nThe government moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t, and\nthe motion was granted (Tr. 85\u201386).   \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts ranging from $43 to\n$20,198 for about $36,000 in total (excluding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t). A large part of the\nindebtedness is due to medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\u20131.n). In her response to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations and provided explanations about her efforts to\naddress the debts. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a privately-held research and technology\ncompany. She works in the field of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing in support of\na missile-defense program. She has worked for her current employer since February\n2005. She held an interim security clearance, without incident, from about April 2005\nuntil the SOR was issued. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the\nDefense Department the first time.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, which she does not dispute, stem from a difficult\nmarriage that eventually ended when she divorced her husband. She married her then\n34-year-old husband in 1995 when she was 19 years old, and the couple resided in her\n\n3\nhusband\u2019s hometown. Applicant had moved there a few years earlier. The marriage\nproduced four sons, now ages 11, 9, 7, and 5. The three oldest sons attend public\nschool.\nWithin 18 months of her marriage, Applicant learned that her husband was not\nfinancially responsible. He was the sole breadwinner and viewed his earnings as his\nmoney, which he spent as he saw fit. This often resulted in a lack of money for basic\nnecessities. This was a source of disagreement and contention between Applicant and\nher husband. The financial problems became so troublesome that in 1998 the couple\nsought relief via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Exhibit 3 at 3-4). The bankruptcy court granted\na discharge of about $100,000 of indebtedness. The bankruptcy petition was joint,\nalthough Applicant explained that she felt she had little choice but to go along with it.\nApplicant explained that they moved frequently because her husband failed to\npay rent, and she endured other hardships (Tr. 42\u201344). On one occasion, she was\nforced to heat water on a gas grill for bathing her sons because there was no gas to\nheat water in the house. On another occasion, she ran an extension cord to a\nneighbor\u2019s house to obtain electricity to run a fan in the summer. When she was\npregnant with her fourth child she went without eating for four days so that her three\nsons had enough to eat. Her husband used her good credit by accepting credit card\noffers in her name and then running up debt on the accounts (Tr. 44). In sum, Applicant\ndescribed her marriage as follows:\nI was in a nightmare. And it quickly became a game of survival. Because\nonce the arguments about finances elevated to the point that he became\nphysically abusive, and I knew the only way that I could provide the\nlifestyle for my family was if I finished school. And though it was extremely\ndifficult, I knew it was something I absolutely must do (Tr. 38).\nIn November 2001, Applicant called the police and reported her husband for\nspouse abuse (Exhibit B\u2013III). He was charged with the misdemeanor offense of 4th\ndegree aggravated assault/spouse abuse. Shortly thereafter, on December 1, 2001, he\nwas charged with contempt of court for violating a protective order stemming from the\ninitial charge. Both charges were disposed of in January 2002 via a guilty finding and a\nsentence that included 60 days in jail (suspended).\nA large part of Applicant\u2019s indebtedness is due to medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\u20131.n)\nAlthough available through his job as a driver, her husband declined to enroll in his\nemployer\u2019s health-insurance plan (Tr. 46\u201347). Without health insurance, the expenses\nassociated with the births of her four sons were covered by a state government\nprogram, which included care for the mother for six weeks after child birth. More than\nsix weeks after the birth of her fourth son, Applicant developed medical problems\nassociated with child birth resulting in a 26-day hospital stay. The medical bills in the\nSOR stem from this incident. \n\n4\nApplicant attended a state university as a part-time student from June 1994 until\nher graduation in December 2004, when she was awarded a bachelor of science\ndegree with a major in engineering graphics and design (Exhibits 1 and E). She then\ndecided it was time to obtain a divorce because she would now be able to provide for\nher sons. She consulted a local lawyer who recommended waiting until she relocated to\nanother state for her employment. She moved with her sons to her current state of\nresidence in February 2005. The divorce case commenced in October 2005, and her\nhusband did not respond to the complaint. In December 2005, the state court found her\nhusband in default and granted Applicant a divorce (Exhibit B\u2013IV). She was awarded\nphysical and legal custody of her sons and he was granted visitation rights. The court\nalso ordered her husband to pay child support of $1,348 per month. He is paying child\nsupport at the rate of about $1,200 per month. Applicant has not sought to force him to\npay the court-ordered amount and has elected to take what she can get at this point.\nThe divorce decree did not assign debts to either party. \nApplicant addressed the debts alleged in the SOR during her testimony (Tr.\n70\u201385). The status of accounts is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013collection account for $5,316.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A, Tab A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013collection account for $487.\nPaid (Exhibit A, Tab B).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013collection account for $2,215.\nCollection lawsuit dismissed because ex-\nhusband paid account (Exhibit A, Tab C;\nTr. 75-77).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013charged-off account for $790.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A, Tab D).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013collection account for $301.\nPaid (Exhibit A, Tab E). \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013collection account for $324.\nAccount in ex-husband\u2019s name; unable to\nobtain information (Exhibit A, Tab F; Tr.\n79\u201380).\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\u20131.n\u2013medical collection\naccounts with same creditor for $24,779.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A, Tab\nG\u2013N; Tr. 80\u201383).\nSOR \u00b6 1.o\u2013collection account for $43.\nPaid (Exhibit A, Tab O).\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p\u20131.q\u2013collection accounts for\n$1,091 and $515 with same creditor.\nIn repayment program (Exhibit A, Tab\nP\u2013Q).\nSOR \u00b6 1.r\u2013collection account for $199.\nCreditor researching account to see what\nis owed, if anything (Exhibit A, Tab R). \nIn about June 2007, Applicant engaged a company to serve as a debt-\nmanagement agent for four creditors (Exhibit A, Enclosure 4; Exhibit B\u2013VI, VII). It is a\n\n5\n48-month repayment program with the specific purpose of settling debts. She has made\nthe required monthly payments since June 2007 (Exhibits C and D). The program has\nan estimated completion date of June 2011. She hopes to complete it sooner by making\nextra payments. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial condition is much improved. Her gross annual salary\nis about $59,000. Including child support at $1,200 monthly, her total annual income is\nabout $73,000. She describes her family\u2019s lifestyle as living by necessities. In about\nDecember 2006, Applicant\u2019s mother moved in with her to help with the children, thereby\nreducing Applicant\u2019s childcare costs, which was a major expense (Tr. 65\u201366). As a\nresult, her monthly budget now shows a positive cash flow of about $570 (Exhibit B\u2013X).\nThis includes payments for the repayment program as well as student loan payments,\nwhich are current (Exhibit B\u2013VIII, IX). She participates in her employer\u2019s 401(k)\nretirement savings plan by contributing an amount sufficient to obtain the full benefit of\nher employer\u2019s matching contribution (Tr. 100\u2013101). In addition to money in a checking\naccount, she has about $1,000 in a savings account for unexpected expenses; she has\nalso established savings accounts for her four sons (Exhibit B\u2013X). She recently tapped\ninto her savings account to pay for a $700 auto repair rather than incurring more debt.\nShe has a credit card that her father established as a joint account between them. She\nuses it for business travel.    \nApplicant loves her job, and she takes satisfaction knowing that her work\nsupports the Defense Department and the war fighter (Tr. 87\u201388). She is interested in\nfurthering her education by pursuing a master\u2019s degree and perhaps a doctorate. But\nher more immediate goal is to normalize her family\u2019s life, and getting her finances under\ncontrol is a major part of that process (Tr. 103\u2013104).\nApplicant presented a wealth of favorable character witnesses. Three witnesses\nappeared and 18 individuals submitted letters of recommendation (Exhibit B\u2013I).\nUniformly, these people, many retired military officers and employees in the defense\nindustry, endorse Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. A few of their\ncomments are as follows:\n\u2022\nA dedicated, trustworthy, and moral person.\n\u2022\nA person of high integrity.\n\u2022\nA critical asset to the mission.\n\u2022\nAn outstanding work ethic.\n\u2022\nDedicated to her family and her job.\nTwo of the witnesses are particularly noteworthy. The first is the department chair\nfrom the university she attended. He recruited her for his program and served as her\nacademic advisor. He has worked 30 years in academia and describes Applicant as a\nrole model for other students. To that end, he invited Applicant to serve on an industrial\nadvisory committee for his department.

The company is considering assisting her with debt repayment,\nbut held off doing so to avoid creating a financial windfall that Applicant would have to\nexplain for this proceeding. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n7\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 14. \n18\n8\nGuideline F contains six conditions that could mitigate the security concerns.18\nThe record evidence is sufficient to conclude that five of the six mitigating conditions\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor as follows:\n\u2022\nthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u2022\nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n\u2022\nthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u2022\nthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts; and \n\u2022\nthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue. \nEach MC is discussed below. \nThe first MC applies because Applicant incurred this indebtedness during a bad\nmarriage with a spouse who was financially irresponsible. Those circumstances are\nunlikely to recur because Applicant obtained a divorce in 2005 and she is now in charge\nof her family\u2019s finances. Because she resolved the source of her financial problems, and\nshe has a plan to pay her debts, her financial problems do not cast doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe second MC applies because Applicant incurred this indebtedness under\ncircumstances largely beyond her control. It appears she was in a bad marriage with a\nspouse who was financially irresponsible and abusive to her. She elected to remain in\nthe marriage to complete her education. Having done so, she left her husband, started\nher new job, and obtained a divorce. She is now in the process of cleaning up debts\nfrom the marriage. Given the circumstances of this particular case, she has acted\nresponsibly. \nThe third MC applies because there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved or are under control. As established by the table above,\n\n9\nApplicant has addressed the debts at issue in the SOR by various ways. She is not\nincurring new delinquent debt and is living within her means.  \nThe fourth MC is most pertinent here, as it requires a person to initiate a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. She has made\nsubstantial efforts to resolve the delinquent debts as established by the table above.\nThe repayment program is addressing a large part of the indebtedness and she has\nmade the required payments since beginning the program in June 2007. She is earning\na good salary, and along with the child-support payments and the reduction in childcare\nexpenses, has sufficient income to pay her normal  living expenses and her debts. Her\nefforts are sufficient to constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline.\nThe fifth MC applies because Applicant has disputed three of the debts alleged in\nthe SOR. The first is SOR \u00b6 1.c, a collection account for $2,215. She disputed the\nlegitimacy of this debt by showing that her ex-husband paid the account resulting in\ndismissal of a collection lawsuit (Exhibit A, Tab C). The second is SOR \u00b6 1.f, a collection\naccount for $324. She presented evidence that this account is in her husband\u2019s name\nand he is taking care of it. She documented her efforts to dispute the debt to the extent\nthat she was able to do so (Exhibit A, Tab F). The third is SOR \u00b6 1.r, a collection\naccount for $199. She presented documentary evidence that she may owe nothing as it\nis currently being researched by the creditor (Exhibit A, Tab R). \nThis case has also been considered under the whole-person concept. Applicant\nis 31 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about her finances.\nShe has demonstrated her maturity and good judgment by taking positive, concrete\nactions to address the financial problems caused by her troubled marriage. Unlike many\napplicants in financial cases, Applicant has (1) a realistic and workable plan to resolve\nher financial problems, (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan, and (3)\nshown a measurable improvement to the situation. Her documentary evidence shows\nthat she is working hard to resolve her past indebtedness. \nApplicant met the challenge of a bad marriage and delinquent debts by\npersevering under difficult circumstances. She was a full-time mom and a part-time\nstudent while coping with a husband who was abusive and financially irresponsible.\nAfter earning her college degree, she left her husband and obtained a divorce. Due to\nher talents, skills, and hard work, she is now a working professional with a bright future,\nfor her and her sons. She epitomizes the notion of doing the best you can with what you\nhave. These circumstances are indicative of the character traits of determination,\nintegrity, and good judgment, which are certainly relevant in this proceeding.  \nTo conclude, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\nand unfavorable, and I have no doubts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant met her ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.r\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.s\u20131.t\nWithdrawn\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 8), on June\n22, 2006. On July 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item1) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded three times to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, the first two\nsigned but undated (Items 3 and 5),  and the third, dated August 28, 2007 (Item 7), in\nwhich she requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn November 16, 2007, Department Counsel issued the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on February 3, 2008.\nApplicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 27, 2008.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits (Items 1-11).\nNo documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F- Financial Considerations)\nIn her RSOR (Items 3,5, and 7) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations\nunder Guideline F. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 44 years old. She works for a defense contractor, and she seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 20 allegations (1.a. through 1.t.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. As reviewed above, Applicant admitted all of these\nallegations in her RSOR, and no evidence was introduced to modify or dispute these\nallegations and admissions. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,612. No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,121.

No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.m. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in the amount of $2,065.65 on July 2005.\nThis debt was satisfied on December 6, 2006.  \n1.n. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $298.  No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.o. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $83.  No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.p. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $25.  No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.q. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $181.  No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.r. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $959.

No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \n1.t. This overdue debt to is cited in the SOR in the amount of $106.  No evidence\nhas been introduced to establish that any of this debt has been paid. \nApplicant\u2019s overdue debts were accumulated over a period from at least July\n2002 until as recently as March 2007. There is no indication in the record that Applicant\n\n4\never received financial counseling, nor is there any explanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to\nresolve even the smallest of overdue debts.  \nIn her RSOR, Applicant stated that she lost her job as a casino dealer on March\n3, 2003. As a result of her unemployment her home had to be sold, two days before it\nwas scheduled to be foreclosed, and her vehicle was repossessed. She further\nindicated that her employment since that time has not compensated her sufficiently for\nher to become more financially sound. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on June 22, 2006 (Item 8). Question 28.a.\nasks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and she listed no debts. The Government\nalleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as 1.a. through\n1.o. \nApplicant did not respond to this SOR allegation in her RSOR, but clearly all of\nthese debts had been delinquent for more than 180 days when Applicant completed and\nexecuted the SCA. She also failed to give any possible explanation for her failure to\nadmit any overdue debts and at least list some of those debts for which she was more\nthan 180 days overdue. \n2.a. Question 28.b. of the SCA asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and she listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.a. through 1.o.\nApplicant also did not respond to this SOR allegation in her RSOR, but there is\nno dispute that these debts were more than 90 days delinquent when Applicant\ncompleted and executed the SCA. Applicant also failed to give an explanation for her\nfailure to admit that, at the time she completed the SCA, she had current debts that\nwere more than 90 days overdue.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n5\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy\nher debts, and her long history of not meeting her financial obligations.\nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. While MC 20.(b) could\ninitially be argued to apply since some of Applicants financial problems were as a result\nof her loss of employment, it has not been established that Applicant has acted\n\n6\nresponsibly under the circumstances, since she has failed to resolve any of her overdue\ndebts, even those debts for which a minimal amount is owing, and she has failed to\nseek any financial counseling which could help to resolve financial difficulties now and in\nthe future.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that she executed on June\n22, 2006. Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the last\nseven years prior to her completing the SCA, nor any current debts that were over 90\ndays overdue, when clearly she should have identified the debts listed on the SOR.\nApplicant had no explanation for her failure to put the Government on notice that she\nhad financial difficulties.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history, my\ninability to see the Applicant and judge her veracity in person, and the lack of any\nwitness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no reasonable\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information to the\nGovernment on the SCA, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly\nfailed to give complete, honest information to the Government. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC16. (a) applies\nbecause Applicant deliberately provided false and misleading information to the\nGovernment in a SCA.   No Mitigating Condition applies under this Guideline.  As a\nresult of the misinformation that Applicant  provided to the Government, her conduct\nexhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Guideline\nE against Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's evidence opposing her request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's SOR. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n7\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, her failure to resolve the overdue debts, even the very small ones, and her\nwillful omissions made to the Government, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwith significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant worked as a security officer outside the defense industry from August 2002 until September 2005, and as a cashier in a retail store beginning in June 2006 until an undisclosed date.

Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, dated September 30, 2007, in which he admitted the\nallegations contained in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, denied the allegations contained\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\nin subparagraphs 1.h through 1.n, and requested a clearance decision based on the written\nrecord without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 19,\n2007, that was mailed to Applicant on November 21, 2007. That copy of the FORM was\napparently not received by Applicant. The FORM was resent to Applicant on February 20,\n2008. Applicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his\nobjections to any information contained in the FORM or to submit any additional\ninformation he wished to be considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nFebruary 27, 2008, but did not submit a response to the FORM or object to anything\ncontained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned to me on May\n2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 48 years old. He was employed as a security officer by a defense\ncontractor for several months in 2006 until he was laid off due to the loss of his interim\nsecurity clearance. Applicant worked as a security officer outside the defense industry from\nAugust 2002 until September 2005, and as a cashier in a retail store beginning in June\n2006 until an undisclosed date. He was unemployed from September 2000 until August\n2002, as a result of being fired from a job as a legal clerk with the U.S. Army, and again\nfrom October 2005 until June 2006, for undisclosed reasons. \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1978, and obtained an associate of\narts degree in May 1986. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1978 until\nDecember 1979. Applicant was married in July 1982, and that marriage ended in divorce\nin March 1983. He did not report having any dependents in the security clearance\napplication he submitted in 2006.\nSOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a judgment that was entered against Applicant in or\nabout 2001 in the amount of $3,130. He admits this debt but claims it is the result of a\ndispute with a former landlord over water damage that was done to his apartment as a\nresult of a fire in an upstairs apartment. It remains unsatisfied.\nThe SOR alleges two charged off accounts, subparagraphs 1.g and 1.k, that are\nowing in the total amount of $2,126. Applicant admitted the debt alleged in subparagraph\n1.g, although his credit report indicates he has filed a dispute over that debt. He denied the\ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.k, but in the explanation he provided in his SOR answer\nhe acknowledged he had a credit card with that creditor but indicated he objected to the\namount alleged because $1,074 of that amount represents accrued interest. Neither debt\nhas been satisfied.\n\n The SOR alleges two additional collection accounts in subparagraphs 1.l and 1.m that are not\n2\nincluded in this total. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l is clearly the same debt that is alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.a. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m appears very strongly to be the same debt alleged\nin subparagraph 1.i based upon the amount listed under the \u201ccredit limit\u201d heading in Applicant\u2019s August 2006\ncredit report (SOR Item 6).  \n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n3\nThe SOR alleges nine accounts, totalling $6,726, that have been submitted for\ncollection.  Applicant admits his responsibility for each of the debts listed in subparagraphs\n2\n1.b through 1.f. He denied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, but admitted owing the\ncreditor and indicated he objected to the debt because it involved rental of a storage unit\nand the creditor refusing to return his property although he was less than three months in\narrears at the time of the company\u2019s refusal. He denied the allegations contained in\nsubparagraphs 1.j and 1.n by asserting he did not recognize the listed creditors. Both\nallegations are supported by the contents of Applicant\u2019s credit reports included as part of\nthe FORM. None of these creditors has been satisfied. \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to being unjustly fired from his employment\nwith the U.S. Army in September 2000, and the resulting unemployment. However, he\nprovided no explanation why he did not make any payments or payment arrangements on\nany of the debts while he was employed from August 2002 until September 2005, and\nagain for a period in 2006. He submitted a personal financial statement in June 2007\n(FORM Item 7) in which he listed $115 as his only monthly income and $483 as his\nmonthly living expenses.         \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n11\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has 12 severely delinquent debts, totalling almost $12,000, that have been\nsubmitted for collection, charged off as bad debts, or that resulted in a judgment being\nentered against him. All of those debts have been delinquent for at least a couple of years.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC\n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant attributes his severely delinquent debt to the nearly two years\nunemployment he experienced between 2000 and 2002. However, he was gainfully\nemployed from August 2002 until September 2005, and again for a period of time in 2006,\nbut failed to make any payment or payment arrangements on any of the debts during those\nperiods of employment. He did not submit any evidence to indicate he has sought financial\n\n5\ncounselling. The financial statement he submitted in June 2007 strongly indicates he not\nonly lacks the ability to make any payment on any of the debts but he is for all intents and\npurposes destitute. Finally, he provided no evidence to indicate he is or has been seeking\nemployment or doing anything else to remedy his current financial situation. Accordingly,\nApplicant is not entitled to application of any Guideline F mitigating condition.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of\nthe Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions. I conclude Applicant has failed\nto mitigate the security concern caused by the financial considerations present in this case.\nHe has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of\npersuasion. Guideline F is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l & m\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph   1.n\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He \nmitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nClearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 1, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard \nForm (SF) 86.1 On September 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \n \nMarch 4, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 27, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 6, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 24, 2008, convening a hearing on \nDecember 17, 2008. Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance on December 8, \n2008, which I granted. A second notice of hearing was issued on December 12, 2008, \nconvening a hearing on January 21, 2009. At the hearing, the government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 23-\n24). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented two exhibits, marked Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 26). DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 28, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn December 8, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance and \nrequested a continuance. On January 16, 2009, counsel withdrew his appearance \nstating that for personal reasons Applicant decided to represent himself. At his hearing, \nApplicant confirmed his attorney\u2019s statements. He also indicated he had sufficient time \nto prepare for his hearing and was ready to proceed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the single financial allegation under SOR \u00b6 1. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior financial manager working for a government \ncontractor. In 1979, he completed his first Bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. \nHe completed a master\u2019s in business administration in August 1981, and a second \nbachelor\u2019s degree in accounting in May 2007 (Tr. 6-8). He was taking the Certified \nPublic Accountant exam (Tr. 39). \n \nHe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1973, and served honorably until December \n1976, when he was discharged at the rank of E-5 (Tr. 66). He married his wife in \nOctober 1975. They have twin daughters of this marriage, both of whom are working \nadults. His wife and two daughters work for a government contractor who performs \nsecurity investigations for a government agency.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nFrom 1996 to 2001, Applicant was employed by a large company as a senior \nconsultant. In 2001, he resigned his employment to start his own business as a small \nbusiness consultant providing accounting/financial services, management, succession \nplanning, and business advice (Tr. 38). His business never developed as he expected, \nand he had to take several small jobs, sometimes not related to his expertise, to make \nends meet. He was unemployed or underemployed from 2001 to March 2006 (Tr. 27-\n28). During this period, Applicant used his credit to pay for his family\u2019s day-to-day living \nexpenses and acquired numerous debts that became delinquent.  \n \nApplicant resolved part of his bad debt totaling around $30,000 to $40,000 \nprimarily by refinancing his home in 2005 and 2006 (Tr. 29-31). In April 2006, Applicant \nfound stable employment and quadrupled his earnings. He used his additional earnings \nto pay other debts. He changed jobs in 2007, when he was hired by his current \nemployer, a government contractor. He has been working for his employer for \napproximately 16 months (Tr. 63). \n \nApplicant testified he overlooked the debt alleged in the SOR when he refinanced \nhis home in 2006 to pay delinquent debts. He attempted to refinance his home again in \nearly 2008, but was unsuccessful. In May 2008, he retained the services of a law firm to \nassist him in negotiating and settling the debt (Tr. 32). He settled the debt in December \n2008 for less than what he owed. He took a loan against his 401(k) retirement plan to \nsatisfy the debt and to pay his attorney\u2019s fees. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is approximately $4,600 (Tr. 47-49). His \nwife\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $4,000. She contributes to the household \nfinances and pays some of the family\u2019s financial expenses. Applicant and his wife have \nadditional expenses because they provide financial assistance to his mother and his \nwife\u2019s mother. Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses include his mortgage ($2,500 a month) and \nthe payment of his three credit cards. He carries a Visa with a balance of $2,600, a \nMaster Card with a balance of $4,200, and a large department store charge card with a \nbalance of $13,000 (GE 44-45). He pays approximately $800 a month towards his credit \ncard debt (Tr. 49).  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his past financial problems. He claimed he has \nlearned his lesson and he is now well aware of what it is required of him to show that he \nis reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. He is very concerned about the \nadverse impact loosing his security clearance will have on his family and his career. He \npromised never to let himself get into another financial predicament again. Before 2001 \nhe had no financial problems. He stated he has performed well for government \ncontractors and that he is considered a responsible and reliable employee. He believes \nhe and his wife are now more financially stable and stronger than they were in 2001. He \nhas been investing time and effort to educate himself to become more competitive in the \njob market. He believes that completing his CPA certification will create additional job \nopportunities for him to earn more income and to be able to resolve his current financial \nobligations. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR \nresponse, his answers to the DOHA interrogatories, and his testimony. Since around \n2001, he acquired numerous debts which became delinquent and remained outstanding \nfor many years. As of the SOR date, he had one delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$19,660. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I find Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial security concerns. Available evidence suggests Applicant had no financial \nproblems before 2001. He established circumstances beyond his control that \ncontributed to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., he quit his job in 2001 to establish his \nown consulting business, his failed business enterprise, and his inability to find stable \nemployment until 2006. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n \nApplicant contacted his creditors, refinanced his home twice and used his home \nequity to pay his delinquent debts. After he found stable employment and increased his \nearnings, he settled and paid additional delinquent debts. Apparently, he either \noverlooked his last delinquent debt when he refinanced his home in 2006, or he did not \nhave the financial means to pay the debt at that time. He contacted the creditor and \ntried to settle the account on his own without success. Around May 2008, he retained \nthe services of a law firm to assist him negotiate the resolution of his last delinquent \ndebt. By the time of his hearing, he had paid his debt using a 401(k) loan. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence shows he dealt responsibly with his financial obligations before receipt of the \nSOR and he has resolved his delinquent debts. \n \nApplicant still carries a significant ($20,000) credit card debt; however, he does \nnot seem to be financially overextended. Considering his and his wife\u2019s current \nearnings, he should be able to resolve his current debts in the foreseeable future. \nApplicant promised to pay his debts and to avoid future financial problems. In light of \nApplicant\u2019s past actions to resolve his debts, I believe it is likely he will continue to be \nfinancially responsible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n \n7 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s honorable service in the Army and his years working for government \ncontractors weigh in his favor. Other than a DWI offense, he has no police record. Aside \nfrom her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding \ncitizen, a concerned son, and a caring father and husband. He expressed regrets for his \nfinancial mistakes and presented evidence that he is correcting them.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \n \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

However, at his hearing he mitigated all SOR allegations except for six \nincidents of fraudulent activity and one allegation of making a false statement to an \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on February 21, 2008. He failed to \nmitigate security concerns under Guideline E. Access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 26, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On September 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nMay 5, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. (HE 4) On January 12, 2010, Department \nCounsel announced she was ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On January 22, \n2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On January 25, 2010, and February 19, \n2010, DOHA issued hearing notices. (HE 1, 2) On March 3, 2010, Applicant\u2019s hearing \nwas held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) (Tr. 13), \nand Applicant offered five exhibits (AE A-E) with 15 enclosures to AE A, and 55 \nenclosures to AE E. (Tr. 14-15; AE A-E) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-\n4 (Tr. 16), and AE A-E. (Tr. 16) Additionally, I admitted the hearing notices, SOR, and \nresponse to the SOR. (HE 1-4) On March 11, 2010, I received the transcript. I admitted \nAE F-I on March 11, 2010.1 I held the record open until March 25, 2010, to receive \nclosing arguments, which were admitted along with some emails as HE 5-7.     \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c to 1.l. (HE 4) As for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, he did not disclose on his October 26, \n2005, SF 86 that his security clearance was denied at another government agency \n(AGA) because he was not aware that the AGA had denied his access to classified \ninformation.

(Tr. 19; AE E at 1)3 \nHis primary function for his employer is in the area of computer security. (Tr. 97-100) He \nserved an initial enlistment in the military from 1974 to 1980.

(Tr. \n \n1Department Counsel objected to the admissibility of AE F-I because the record was previously \nclosed. (HE 5) Department Counsel\u2019s objection was overruled.   \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this section are from Applicant\u2019s October 26, 2005, security \nclearance application. (GE 1) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n184) From September 2005 to October 25, 2008, Applicant worked as a security guard. \nFrom July 2005 to September 2005, he was unemployed. From February 2003 to July \n2005, he was employed as a senior staff manager. He married in June 1992, and \ndivorced in April 2002. In September 2002, he married his current spouse. His son was \nborn in 1975, and is currently serving in the Navy. Applicant has completed some \ncollege and numerous courses while in military service. \n \nSOR allegations \n \nIn about 1975, Applicant set his vehicle on fire, told the police the vehicle was \nstolen, filed a claim with his insurance company, and received a $600 payment. (Tr. \n149-150; SOR \u00b6 1.l) Applicant was on active duty in the military at that time, his son was \nin the hospital, and Applicant\u2019s had just completed basic training. (Tr. 150) His pay was \nlow and he committed the fraud because he needed money for his family. (Tr. 150) \n \nApplicant left active duty in 1980 after his first enlistment. (Tr. 153) In about 1980 \nor 1981 after leaving active duty, Applicant took his roommate\u2019s stereo and speakers, \nstored them at a friend\u2019s house, told his roommate that the property was taken in a \nrobbery, and then kept the property. (Tr. 150-152; SOR \u00b6 1.k; HE 3, 4) At his hearing, \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations as stated, except he denied he told his \nroommate the property was taken in a robbery. (Tr. 151) He claimed his roommate told \nthe police the property was taken in a robbery, and he never corrected the roommate\u2019s \nstatement to the police. (Tr. 151) He explained his roommate owed him money for his \nroommate\u2019s share of the rent, and the property he took was of a lesser value than the \ndebt. (Tr. 152) The roommate moved out a week after the theft without paying the rent \nhe owed Applicant. (Tr. 152) \n \nApplicant and a friend burned-down a garage owned by the friend so his friend \ncould make an insurance claim. (Tr. 153; SOR \u00b6 1.h; HE 3, 4) Applicant told the friend \nabout the arson of his vehicle, and the friend came up with the idea of burning his own \ngarage as a way to make money. (Tr. 153) Applicant set fire to the garage and then \ncalled the Fire Department. (Tr. 154) Applicant received about $100 for setting the fire. \n(Tr. 154) \n \nIn about 1982 while serving on active duty in the military, Applicant filed a \nrequest for a travel advance for about $1,000. (Tr. 154-155; SOR \u00b6 1.j; HE 3, 4) After he \nreceived the $1,000, he spent it and then filed a false claim to a Government Finance \nOffice indicating the money was taken from him in a robbery. (Tr. 154) He filed the false \nclaim because he was behind on his house payment and needed funds. (Tr. 155)  \n  \nIn about 1984, Applicant pushed his car over a cliff and then filed a claim with his \ninsurance company. (SOR \u00b6 1.i; HE 3, 4). At his hearing, Applicant denied that he \npushed his car over a cliff. (Tr. 157) Instead, he said his car was on a hill, and his leg \ncramped from riding his bicycle earlier that day. (Tr. 157) He jumped out of his car, and \nforgot to set the brake. (Tr. 157) The car rolled down the hill, and Applicant thought it \nwas too risky to try to stop it. (Tr. 157) His car was damaged when it came to rest at the \nbottom of the hill. (Tr. 157-158) A tow truck hooked-up to his car; however, the tow truck \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \ndriver negligently failed to properly use his wheels and brakes on the hill. (Tr. 157-158) \nThe tow truck rolled over on top of Applicant\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 158) He argued he would not \npush his car off a cliff because the area is busy, and if he pushed his car off a cliff he \nmay have been caught. (Tr. 158) Also, the area back to his residence was isolated and \ndangerous, and it would be inconvenient to return to his home on foot. (Tr. 158)     \n \nIn 1993, Applicant was transferred on a permanent change of station move. (Tr. \n159) His household goods were badly damaged in the move. (Tr. 159) He filed a claim \nfor tens of thousands of dollars at the legal office at an Air Force Base. (Tr. 159) \nApplicant\u2019s claim form indicated that some compact discs (CD) were damaged in the \nmove. (Tr. 160) The claims office advised Applicant that some inspectors were coming \nover to look at the damaged household goods. (Tr. 160) Applicant called his spouse, \nand told her that the claims office might not pay the claim for the CDs because they \nwould not be able to see the damage to them. (Tr. 160) His spouse told Applicant that \nshe would take them out to the porch and scratch them up on the concrete porch. (Tr. \n160) He claimed when the CDs were shipped they were in a wooden box, which was \nbroken to pieces, and the CDs were damaged in the move and skipped. (Tr. 160) She \ntook their CDs out onto the porch and damaged them with the objective of bolster their \nclaim for damage to their household goods. (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. 160)  \n \nIn about 1997, Applicant\u2019s van was shipped from overseas to the United States, \nand the shipper volunteered that the van was damaged during transit. (Tr. 161) The \nshipper thought his radio had been stolen because the dash was ripped open and the \nradio was missing. (Tr. 162) Applicant filed a claim for the missing radio and did not \ndisclose that the radio was not working when the vehicle was shipped. (Tr. 162; SOR \u00b6 \n1.f; HE 3, 4) He did not know why his radio did not work, and it could have been a loose \nwire or some very minor problem. (Tr. 162)  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s last active duty assignment, he was a first sergeant, and \nApplicant felt pressure when his spouse threatened to tell his commander false stories \nof his misconduct. (Tr. 178) He did not elaborate about the content of her threats. \nApplicant began to change after he retired from military service in 1998. (Tr. 177) In \n2001, he had an argument with his spouse about whether her son should go to Canada \nto avoid a possible draft. (Tr. 178) He decided to divorce his spouse. (Tr. 178-179) \n  \nIn about 2001, Applicant and his spouse argued about each other\u2019s extramarital \nrelationships. (GE 4 at 10) Applicant\u2019s spouse wanted to take the hard drive from \nApplicant\u2019s computer because of Applicant\u2019s emails to his future spouse. (GE 4 at 10) \nDuring a brief struggle, Applicant and his spouse bumped together and some computer \ndisks fell onto the floor. (GE 4 at 10) Applicant\u2019s spouse called the police, who arrested \nApplicant and jailed him overnight. (GE 4 at 10-11) The police charged Applicant with \nharassment and domestic violence. (Tr. 162; SOR \u00b6 1.e; HE 3, 4) Dr. S, infra, at page 9 \nprepared a psychological assessment, which indicated Applicant did not have any \npsychological problems that would lead to violence. (Tr. 163-164; AE C) The charge \nagainst Applicant was dismissed, and the court sealed the records relating to the \ncharge. (Tr. 164) Applicant disclosed the charges on his October 25, 2005, SF 86. (Tr. \n164)  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nIn about 2002, Applicant retained U.S. Government speakers valued at about \n$30 without authorization. (Tr. 165; SOR \u00b6 1.d; HE 3, 4) Applicant said his supervisor \nauthorized him to take the speakers home. (Tr. 165) The speakers were scheduled to \ngo to the Defense Rehabilitation and Management Office (DRMO), and the value of $30 \nwas an estimate. (Tr. 166) The salvage value at DRMO might be about one dollar. (Tr. \n167) Applicant was living in a hotel room, and he lost the speakers in the cluttered hotel \nroom. (Tr. 166) The speakers were loaded into a box and forgotten. (Tr. 167) \n \nIn June 2003, July 2003, and December 2004, AGA investigators interviewed \nApplicant. (Tr. 204) Each time he was interviewed, he provided more damaging \ninformation about his background. (Tr. 204) At the last AGA interview, he revealed that \nhe damaged 200 CDs to bolster his claim on his permanent change of station move and \nhe filed a claim for reimbursement relating to a missing inoperable radio in his vehicle. \n(Tr. 205-206) He disclosed the two potentially inflated claims after being aggressively \ninterrogated for a substantial period of time and not at the start of the last interview. (Tr. \n206-208)    \n \n2005 security clearance application (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \nOn October 26, 2005,4 Applicant completed his most recent security clearance \napplication. (Tr. 196; SF 86; GE 1) Section 26a asks, \u201ca. Has the United States \nGovernment ever investigated your background and/or granted you a security \nclearance? If your response is \u2018No,\u2019 or you don\u2019t know or can\u2019t recall if you were ever \ninvestigated and cleared, check the \u2018No\u2019 box.\u201d Applicant checked, \u201cYes\u201d and disclosed in \nFebruary 2003 the Defense Department conducted a background investigation for \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI). (GE 1 at 36-37) In August 2000, the \nDefense Department investigated Applicant\u2019s background for a Top Secret clearance. \n(GE 1 at 37) Applicant did not know the date the Defense Department investigated him \nfor a Secret clearance; however, it was sometime after he entered military service in \n1975. (GE 1 at 37-38) Section 26b asks, \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a \nclearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever \nbeen debarred from government employment? (As administrative downgrade or \ntermination of a security clearance is not a revocation.)\u201d Applicant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d (GE \n1 at 38)     \n  \nIn May 2005, AGA denied his access to classified information. AGA sent \nApplicant a letter, dated May 11, 2005, and postmarked May 17, 2005 (denial letter). \nAGA\u2019s denial letter arrived at Applicant\u2019s residence, and he signed for it on May 18, \n2005. Applicant, however, denied that he read AGA\u2019s denial letter. In March 2009, \nApplicant asked for any correspondence between AGA and DOHA. He said he first \n \n4SOR \u00b6 1.b incorrectly lists the security clearance application date as January 19, 2006. \nHowever, the SF 86 is actually dated October 26, 2005. The admitted release forms are dated January \n19, 2006. (GE 1) Applicant did not make a motion to dismiss SOR \u00b6 1.b or request a delay in the \nproceeding because of lack of notice. The favorable resolution of SOR \u00b6 1.b shows Applicant was not \nprejudiced by this error. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nlearned of the contents of the letter in March or April 2009 when he received a letter \nfrom DOHA.  \n \nApplicant is familiar with completion of security clearance applications. (Tr. 184-\n188) He considered the issues of SCI access and his security clearance to be two \nseparate matters. (Tr. 188) After his association with AGA ended, the necessity for SCI \nended. (Tr. 188-189) Applicant denied that his clearance was ever revoked. (Tr. 174) \nHe admitted that he signed for AGA\u2019s certified letter on May 18, 2005. (Tr. 174, 189-\n190) He put the letter on a table by the door, and headed back to lunch. (Tr. 174) When \nhe came home from work, he did not see the letter. (Tr. 175) Things were chaotic at \nhome due to the pending move from the East Coast to another state. (Tr. 175) The AGA \nletter is from an unknown person using a post office box address. (GE 3 at 5) There is \nno indication on the outside of the envelope that it is from AGA. (Tr. 176; GE 3 at 5) The \nfirst time he opened the May 2005 AGA letter was after receiving the DOHA \ninterrogatories in March or April 2009. (Tr. 176-177)  \n \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigative interview (SOR \u00b6 1.c)5 \n \nIn February 2008, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant and generated a \n16-page statement. (GE 4) Applicant signed the statement on February 21, 2008 (GE 4 \nat 1-16). Applicant and the OPM interviewer discussed the multiple AGA interviews. (GE \n4 at 8-9) Applicant noted the AGA investigators interviewed him three times and asked \nhim about his prior incident of alleged domestic violence. (GE 4 at 8) He told the OPM \ninvestigator that he was not aware of the SCI status, and contended the three interviews \nwere necessary because of his alcohol and drug abuse during his first enlistment and \nhis difficult relationship with his alcoholic and abusive father. (GE 4 at 8) The AGA \n \n5Some of Applicant\u2019s OPM statement was inconsistent with his admissions during his AGA \ninterview. For example, Applicant told the AGA interviewer during his February 2004 interview that he \nused marijuana 10 times from January 1976 to December 1980, and twice from October 1982 to March \n1983. (GE 3 at 7) He used cocaine approximately five or six times from May 1978 to December 1980. \n(GE 3 at 7) However, Applicant told the OPM interviewer that he used marijuana on average twice a week \nmore or less from high school to 1982. (GE 4 at 13) He used cocaine after the 1980 to about 1982 on \naverage of once per week by snorting and injecting it. (GE 4 at 13) Once he could not find a vein suitable \nfor cocaine injection and he shot it into his tongue. He denied that he used illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance. (GE 4 at 13) Only one security clearance application is included in the record, and \nApplicant was unsure whether he held a security clearance from 1974 to 1980. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse \nand failure to disclose the extent of his drug abuse to the AGA interviewer were not alleged in the SOR. In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). I have not considered this portion of Applicant\u2019s statement to the OPM investigator for \nany adverse purpose because the record was not fully developed concerning this issue.    \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nwanted an additional interview; however, his security manager informed him it was not \nnecessary.6 (GE 4 at 8)  \n \nThe OPM investigator asked an open question about Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct, \u201cHas your personal conduct ever been in question on any of your prior \nemployments, including the Air Force?\u201d and Applicant answered, \u201cOnly the incident at [a \nprior job] where I commented on the lack of decent equipment to train on.\u201d (GE 4 at 9)  \n \nThe following colloquy occurred between Applicant and the investigator relating \nto his history of fraudulent activity: \n \nQ: Have you ever committed any illegal financial acts such as \nembezzlement, financial frauds or theft? \n \nA: I have never been charged with any financial fraud acts, but I may have \nembellished an insurance claim one time. One time in [location omitted] in \napproximately 1984 or 1985 I had ridden up the mountain on my mountain \nbike. When I was coming back down the mountain with my bike stored in \nmy car, I got a leg cramp. I stopped on the side of the road to stretch my \nleg, and my car rolled off the mountain. My insurance paid for my car and \nfor the bicycle. I asked the insurance company if they wanted the bicycle \nback and they said no. I initially thought the bicycle had been totaled, but \nrealized the frame was not cracked. I was able to repair the bicycle and \nuse it again. I therefore felt guilty about the $200 or $300 that I received \nfor the bicycle. I was never charged with any insurance fraud, I just felt \nguilty over taking the money when the bike was able to be repaired with \nonly a new wheel. \n \nQ: Any other financial type fraud activity? \n \nA: No, none at all. \n \n(GE 4 at 12) The interview concluded: \n \nQ: Do you feel that you have been afforded a full and fair opportunity to \nproperty present the information about the matter under discussion? \n \nA: Yes. You are an excellent interviewer. You listen well, and you ask very \nclear and direct questions. You allowed me to fully explain myself without \nrushing. \n \n \n6The SOR did not allege that Applicant attempted to mislead the OPM investigator about the \nreasons for the multiple interviews AGA conducted. I have not considered this portion of Applicant\u2019s \nstatement to the OPM investigator for any adverse purpose because the record was not fully developed \nconcerning this issue. See n. 5, supra.   \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n(Tr. 199-200) At his hearing, Applicant did not contradict his concluding comment about \nthe lack of coercion involved in his interview. (Tr. 200) He had the opportunity to make \nchanges before he signed his written statement, and he did not change or clarify the \ncritical quoted portion above concerning his history of filing fraudulent claims. (Tr. 200-\n201; GE 4 at 12)   \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained his answer about filing fraudulent claims: \n \nQ: Why did you give that answer [denying any other fraud-type activity] \nthen? \n \nA: The question above says, \u201cDid you ever commit. Have you ever \ncommitted any illegal financial acts.\u201d And because the word \u201cever\u201d was in \nthere I went back into my \u2013 my memory banks, and this is what I picked \nout. When she went into the second question, any other financial type \nfraud activity. I had reverted at that time back to \u2013 when you\u2019re looking at a \nperiodic review or you\u2019re filling out an SF-86, you\u2019re looking at basically a \nten-year wind[ow] of activity. And when I went back to that second \nquestion, when she asked me that, my mind went to that ten-year window, \nand not beyond that.     \n \n(Tr. 169; 191-192) Although the investigator never mentioned the 10-year window, \nApplicant mentally limited the scope of the question to ten years. (Tr. 192-193) \nApplicant further rationalized that he had already revealed other fraudulent activity in his \ninterviews with AGA.7 \n  \nApplicant denied that he was aware that his clearance was revoked by AGA in \n2005. (Tr. 170) He said he was aware that the AGA interviews concerning his clearance \nhad not gone well, and his security manager told him in March 2005 that he was not \ngoing to be allowed to work on AGA\u2019s contracts because of the interviews. (Tr. 170) His \nsecurity manager told him his security clearance was still active, and he was allowed to \ncontinue to work on classified matters, just not on AGA\u2019s contract. (Tr. 172) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current spouse \n \nApplicant met his current spouse in 1987 or 1988. (Tr. 107) When she met \nApplicant his reactions to his son were inappropriately severe. (Tr. 109) Applicant\u2019s \nfather was an alcoholic who abused Applicant. (Tr. 121-122) There were scars on \nApplicant\u2019s back from his father\u2019s beatings. (Tr. 122) Applicant had an issue of \nexcessive anger. (Tr. 110-111) Applicant and his current spouse broke up in 1990 when \nthe military sent Applicant to Germany. (Tr. 112) They became involved again in 2001 \n \n7It is clear from the overall content of the OPM statement, that the OPM interviewer was unaware \nof Applicant\u2019s specific admissions to the AGA interviewer. Applicant is an intelligent, mature person and \nwould have known that the OPM investigator did not know what he told AGA about his history of \nfraudulent acts.   \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n(Tr. 113). Applicant had changed dramatically in recent years. He has become more \ncompassionate. (Tr. 117) They married in September 2002. (Tr. 120)  \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant and his spouse decided to move from the East Coast to a \ndifferent state for an employment opportunity. (Tr. 123-124) Around May 7, 2005, \nApplicant and his spouse traveled by car several thousand miles to a different state. (Tr. \n125-127, 145) Applicant returned to the East Coast, sold their house on the East Coast \nand then joined his wife around the end of June 2005 (Tr. 127). In the March to April \n2009 timeframe, Applicant searched their residence and found the May 11, 2005, denial \nletter from AGA concerning his security clearance in a box in their basement. (Tr. 128-\n129, 145-146; GE 3) He was shocked and astonished that he had not seen the letter in \n2005. (Tr. 128, 129) She believed his astonishment was sincere. (Tr. 130) \n \nSometimes Applicant communicates in a narrow, out-of-context fashion. (Tr. 133) \nShe asks follow-up questions to discover his meaning. (Tr. 133) Applicant complained \nabout his treatment at AGA, indicating AGA interviewers aggressively questioned and \n\u201cbadgered\u201d him about his conduct. (Tr. 137) They insisted that he was not telling the \ntruth, and he was unhappy about his interactions with the interviewers. (Tr. 137) After \nthe second interview at AGA, he told her that he told the truth, and they were still very \naggressive and skeptical about his truthfulness and integrity. (Tr. 138-139) Applicant \nwas worried about whether he would receive the clearance he sought. (Tr. 139)    \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s spouse read the SOR, she was surprised and thought it was \nunbelievable. (Tr. 131) She thought the SOR-listed conduct was inconsistent with \nApplicant\u2019s current character. (Tr. 131) He discussed the SOR allegations with her, and \nwas embarrassed and ashamed about his conduct. (Tr. 134) He emphasized he would \nnot repeat the same misconduct today. (Tr. 135) He is more mature now. (Tr. 132) He is \nexceptionally honest now. (Tr. 134)  \n \nDr. S \n \nDr. S is a licensed professional counselor with specialties in pain management, \nmedical technology, and behavioral health. (Tr. 20-21) He consults on cases with a \npsychiatrist. (AE C) He evaluated Applicant in 2002 and 2009. (Tr. 22-23) He provided a \n21-page 2010 report and a 13-page 2002 report that included a thorough description of \nApplicant\u2019s background. (AE B; AE C) Applicant participated in various psychometric \ntests. (Tr. 24, 28-30, 66-67; AE B; AE C) In October to December 2009, Applicant \nsought Dr. S\u2019s assistance because Applicant had memory issues and concerns about \nhis childhood. (Tr. 26) Dr. S concluded that Applicant had a difficult childhood, which \ncaused him to disassociate from his environment. (Tr. 42-43; AE B at 11) His psyche \ncaused him not to remember things, and he described Applicant as having a type of \npartial, episodic amnesia. (Tr. 43; AE B at 11-12) Applicant was very concrete in his \nthinking and literal in his responses to questions. (Tr. 35-37; AE B; AE C) If a minor part \nof the question was incorrect, then Applicant would answer, \u201cNo,\u201d without explaining his \nanswer. (Tr. 35-36) His view of questions is very narrow. (Tr. 64) This trait caused him \nto appear evasive or deceptive (Tr. 35). Applicant had good scores on the index \nshowing he was not being deceptive. (Tr. 30)  \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nComparing the 2002 and 2009 evaluations, Dr. S described Applicant in 2009 as \nmore mature, polished, courteous, humble, and cooperative. (Tr. 39-40, 65; AE B; AE \nC) In 2002, Applicant was in a maladapted relationship and had a narcissistic persona \nof a macho guy. (Tr. 75; AE C) In 2009, his communication style had improved and his \nthinking was less concrete. (Tr. 40-41, 45; AE B) Applicant understands the difference \nbetween right and wrong. (Tr. 54) In 1980 or 1981, Applicant took his roommate\u2019s \nproperty, and then falsely told the roommate the property had been taken in a robbery. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k) The statement about the property being taken in a robbery is literally \ncorrect. (Tr. 54-56) In 2009, Applicant recognized such conduct was embarrassing. (Tr. \n56) In 1984, when Applicant was 32, he pushed his car over a cliff and filed a claim to \nhis insurance company for the loss. (Tr. 57; SOR \u00b6 1.i) Applicant told Dr. S that he \nneeded the money for food and rent and \u201cyou do what you got to do to feed your family.\u201d \n(Tr. 57) Between 2002 and 2009, Applicant had an epiphany, and he increased his self-\nesteem, self-value, and self-dignity. (Tr. 63) Applicant\u2019s history demonstrates a pattern \nof questionable judgment and irresponsible conduct. (Tr. 71) However, he believed \nApplicant had matured, was honest, and would report a security violation. (Tr. 62-63)         \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant provided evidence from 15 character letters and four witnesses \nsupporting reinstatement of his security clearance. (AE A; Tr. 80-147) Family members \ndescribe Applicant as being the victim of his father\u2019s harsh physical abuse. (AE A) \nRelatives, friends, colleagues, his spouse, and his supervisor, some of whom have \nknown Applicant on and off duty for decades, indicated he has changed for the better in \nrecent years. (Tr. 80-102) He is described as diligent, cordial, positive, caring, loyal, \nphysically fit, dedicated to successful accomplishment of the mission, and trustworthy. \n(AE A) His character witnesses and several persons who provided statements reviewed \nthe SOR and recommended reinstatement of his security clearance because they \nbelieved he is honest and trustworthy. (Tr. 85, 92-93, 100; AE A) Applicant\u2019s awards, \ncertificates of achievement, diplomas, certificates of training, letters of commendation, \nmedals, and performance evaluations document his solid contributions to the Air Force \nand his employer (AE E at 1 to 55).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2009).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline E (personal conduct).  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the \nadjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative;8 \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n \n8The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary \ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant admitted 10 of the 12 allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.l) in his SOR \nresponse. (HE 4) In 1975, he set fire to his vehicle, made a false police report that the \nvehicle was stolen, and then filed a false insurance claim. (SOR \u00b6 1.l) In 1980 or 1981, \nhe stole his roommate\u2019s stereo. (SOR \u00b6 1.k) In 1982, he filed a false claim with the \ngovernment and received $1,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.j) In 1984, he intentionally allowed his car \nto roll down a steep hill and crash,9 and then filed an insurance claim. (SOR \u00b6 1.i) He \nburned a friend\u2019s garage so the friend could file an insurance claim, and was paid $100 \nfor setting fire to this building. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) He bolstered a claim for damage of his \nhousehold goods, by permitting his spouse to damage 200 CDs. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) In 1997, \nhe filed a claim for a missing car radio, and did not disclose the radio did not work. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) In 2001, he was charged with domestic violence/harassment of his spouse. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) In 2002, he kept U.S. government owned speakers valued at about thirty \ndollars. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) On February 21, 2008, Applicant signed a sworn statement \nprepared by an OPM investigator in which he falsely denied the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) When he completed his security clearance \napplication on October 26, 2005, he failed to disclose AGA had revoked his access to \nclassified information in May 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that AGA revoked Applicant\u2019s clearance in May \n2005, for the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.l is factually correct; however, this allegation \ndoes not allege disqualifying conduct. AGA\u2019s revocation of his access to classified \ninformation is an action by the AGA, and not an action by Applicant. There is substantial \nevidence as defined in the policy section, that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d)(1), \n16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) apply. \n \n \n9I am not convinced Applicant pushed his car off a cliff. I am convinced he got out of his car on a \nhill, and intentionally did not set the brake because he wanted to damage it so he could file an insurance \nclaim.   \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17 apply to all of the SOR \nallegations. Some elements of various mitigating conditions partially apply. For \nexample, Applicant received some counseling from Dr. S. He has changed with his \nmarriage in 2002, and he is more calm, conscientious, and able to overcome his difficult \nchildhood in most instances.  \n \nApplicant rebutted the allegation that he falsified his October 25, 2005, security \nclearance application. I accept Applicant statement that he was unaware AGA had \nrevoked his security clearance in May 2005 as truthful and accurate. He freely \nmentioned the multiple difficult interviews at AGA to the OPM investigator. The AGA \nenvelope was not marked so he had no way of knowing the significance of the letter \nwhen he received it. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b is not substantiated, and it is mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 17(f).  \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d that in 2002 Applicant retained some government-\nowned stereo speakers, which he valued at about $30, is mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c). \nHe said his retention of the speakers was initially with his supervisor\u2019s permission and \nsubsequently inadvertent. The speakers had a salvage value of about one dollar. It is \nthe only allegation of misappropriation of government property. This offense is not \nsimilar to his other thefts because it does not involve any deceptive, fraudulent conduct. \nIt is not frequent and minor.   \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e is mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f). In 2001, \nApplicant and his spouse were involved in a brief mutual affray not involving injury. \nApplicant served one-day in jail and was charged with harassment/domestic violence. \nThe charge was dismissed and the record was sealed. He received some counseling \nfrom Dr. S, and no other spousal abuse or domestic violence occurred. \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f is mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f). In 1997, \nApplicant filed a claim for shipping damage to his vehicle. He claimed a radio that did \nnot work, and he did not disclose that the radio did not work on his claim. Without being \nable to review the claim documentation, it is not possible to substantiate that this is \nactually a false claim. The documentation would have to include a false statement that \nthe radio was working, or some other indication of excessive or inflated valuation to \nconstitute a false claim.  \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g to 1.l are all substantiated offenses that show a \npattern of false claims and fraudulent activity. Alteration of evidence (causing damage to \nCDs to bolster a claim for shipping damage), arson of a vehicle, intentionally allowing a \nvehicle to roll down a hill to cause damage for an insurance claim, arson of a garage, \nfiling a false claim for loss of advance pay, and stealing his roommate\u2019s stereo (causing \nthe roommate to file a police report) are all similar theft-by-trick type offenses. Most \nimportantly, Applicant deliberately and intentionally lied to the OPM investigator about \nthese offenses. The only fraudulent activity he revealed was the false insurance claim \nconcerning the time he allowed his car to be damaged by rolling down a hill. Even for \nthat particular false claim, he did not reveal that he intentionally damaged his car to \nsubmit an insurance claim. Instead, he said he felt guilty about claiming the total loss of \nhis bicycle, and he repaired it.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s stated at his hearing that he thought the only fraudulent activity at \nissue was within the 10-year scope of the interview. The sole fraudulent activity he \ndisclosed was in 1984, which was 14 years before his OPM interview. Moreover, his \nexplanation of the 1984 false insurance claim was self-serving, and inconsistent with his \nstatement to the AGA and his SOR response.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s false statement to the OPM investigator about his fraudulent \nactions is significant, recent, serious, and not mitigated. I have not considered non-\nSOR-alleged misconduct, such as his inconsistent statements about his past illegal drug \nuse, in determining whether Applicant\u2019s conduct is mitigated. See note 5 at page 6, \nsupra. The six fraudulent acts outline in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g to 1.l were all admitted in his SOR \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nresponse. They show a pattern of rules violations and similar fraudulent conduct to \nfalsely obtain funds from the U.S. Government and from private insurance companies.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. There is no evidence that he has committed any fraudulent actions after \n1993. He served on active duty for 22 years, and received positive supporting \nendorsements and character references from military personnel and civilians, friends \nand family, superiors and colleagues, who have known him many years. Applicant \nsignificantly contributed to the national defense. He is 57 years old. He is mature and \nresponsible. There is no evidence of any disciplinary problems at work or disloyalty. \nThere is no evidence he would intentionally violate national security, or that he would \ndeliberately fail to safeguard sensitive or classified information. He has provided an \nexceptional \nfile \nof \ngood \ncharacter \nevidence \nincluding \nawards, \nevaluations, \ncommendations, and endorsement spanning many years. His good work performance \nand endorsements of his character witnesses show substantial responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct from 1975 to 1993 shows a pattern of false claims and fraudulent \nactivity. His spouse altered evidence at his behest. She caused damage to CDs to \nbolster a claim for shipping damage by scratching the CDs on concrete. In order to file \nfalse insurance claims, he burned his vehicle and intentionally allowed another vehicle \nto roll down a hill to damage it. He engaged in a conspiracy to burn a garage to defraud \nan insurance company, and received $100. He also defrauded the U.S. Government out \nof $1,000 by filing a false claim for loss of advance pay. He stole his roommate\u2019s stereo. \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nHe presented no evidence that he has apologized or repaid the victims for the funds he \nhad fraudulently obtained, or the stereo he took.  \n \nMost importantly, Applicant deliberately and intentionally lied to an OPM \ninvestigator in February 2008 about these offenses. The importance of providing \naccurate information to an OPM investigator seeking information on whether access to \nclassified information should be granted is manifest. At his hearing, he had an \nopportunity to accept responsibility for his previous false statement to the OPM \ninvestigator by admitting he intentionally provided false information to the OPM \ninvestigator. He did not take full responsibility for providing false information to the OPM \ninvestigator. At his hearing, he falsely claimed that he thought the scope of the time \nframe for providing information about his fraudulent activity was ten years, even though \nelsewhere in his OPM statement, he described drug use and provided other information \nthat was outside the 10-year-window. His claim about his mental state when he failed to \ndisclose his other fraudulent conduct is not credible, and I conclude his false statement \nto the OPM investigator, the critical basis for denial of this clearance, was intentional \nand deliberate. He was 55 years old at the time that he made it and sufficiently mature \nto be fully responsible for his conduct. His false statement to the OPM investigator \nshows lack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such conduct establishes a \nserious security concern, and access to classified information is not warranted.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, my application of the \npertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and all the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns \nrelating to personal conduct. See Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \nApplicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n18 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

DOHA acted under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered the allegations, and\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on\nJuly 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 27, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on August 27, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE 1-4),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nOctober 30, 2009\n\n2\npresented Exhibit (AE) A which was admitted into the record without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on September 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the record,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at the hearing by adding\nallegation \u00b6 1.g under Guideline E: \u00b6 1.g You falsified material facts to an authorized\ninvestigator during a security clearance interview on July 28, 2006 by admitting that you\nengaged in sex with prostitutes, a statement that was knowingly false. Applicant did not\nobject. I granted the motion to amend.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the factual allegations in the SOR except for SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.f \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and obtained an undergraduate degree. He is married and has two grown\nchildren (Tr. 71). He has worked in a professional capacity in the technology field for his\nentire career. He has been with his current employer since 1998  (Tr. 72). He has held a\nsecurity clearance since 2006 (Tr. 73).\nSecurity Violation\nIn 2006, Applicant was on his first assignment in a foreign country. He worked\nwith another U.S. contractor in a U.S. Embassy. In May 2006, approximately three\nmonths into his assignment, he came to work and found a \u201cpink slip\u201d on his desk (Tr.\n59). The slip had the words \u201csecurity violation\u201d on it (Tr. 60). Applicant had never seen\nsuch a notice before that day. He spoke to someone in the regional security office\n(RSO) to determine its import. Applicant explained at the hearing that he was told to\nsign for it. He claims that he had no idea at that time what the significance was of\nreceiving and signing for the pink slip (Tr. 79).\nApproximately one week later, Applicant\u2019s co-worker, who shared his cubicle,\nlearned that Applicant had signed for the security violation. Applicant learned from his\nco-worker that his co-worker had not secured the hard drive at the end of a business\nday which was a security violation. He told Applicant that he already had received other\nsecurity violations and that this was another violation, albeit a minor one (Tr. 65).\nApplicant\u2019s co-worker told Applicant that he did not want to tell the authorities that it was\nhis fault. Applicant agreed that he would take responsibility for the security violation.\nApplicant claimed that he believed since he was a new employee and that this co-\nworker was senior to him, Applicant would not report the co-worker\u2019s violation (Tr. 81). \nThe embassy official counseled Applicant for the security violation during an\ninterview in 2006. Applicant claimed that the official already knew from his co-worker\n\n3\nthat Applicant was not the person who had neglected to return the hard drive to a\nsecure place. Applicant received no other disciplinary action (Tr. 83). \nApplicant received training in handling secure, classified information prior to the\nMay 2006 incident. He acknowledged that he was familiar with the reporting\nrequirement for contractors concerning any adverse information about other employees\n(GE 4).\nIn July 2006, a Department of State investigator interviewed Applicant at the\nembassy concerning the May 2006 incident. Applicant told the investigator that he was\nresponsible for a security violation at his post in May. According to the report of the\ninvestigation (ROI), Applicant explained that he really was not responsible for the\nviolation. He elaborated that he accepted responsibility for the violation on behalf of a\nco-worker. He explained that the co-worker had several previous security violations and\nwas concerned that this would affect his employment. The investigator made a note in\nthe ROI that Applicant lied to the RSO official by accepting responsibility for the violation\nwhen he learned that it was his co-worker\u2019s fault (GE 3).\nSexual Relationship\nDuring the same July 2006 RSO investigation, Applicant was questioned about\nany sexual relationships with prostitutes while in country. Applicant explained that the\nRSO closed the door of his office and Applicant was told anything he would now report\nwas \u201coff the record\u201d (Tr. 16). Applicant claimed he told the RSO that he told him that he\nwent out with a prostitute because he believed the RSO thought that Applicant was gay\n(Tr. 17). Applicant further explained that he did this to \u201cfit in.\u201d Applicant claimed that he\ntried to please people and give answers that he thought they wanted (Tr. 17).\nIn 2006, Applicant attended a party with Embassy co-workers and foreign\nnationals at the home of a co-worker. Applicant believes that he had four or five mixed\ndrinks. He reported being sleepy and going into one of the bedrooms to lie down.\nApplicant \u201cfelt someone walk into the room.\u201d He stated that the person was female and\ngot into the bed with him. He did not remember whether they had sexual intercourse\n(GE 2). When he awoke the next morning, she was gone. He reported that he did not\nsolicit the female and he did not provide any payment to her for anything (GE 2).\nIn August 2008, Applicant affirmed to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigator that he never had sexual relationships with any foreign national females or\nany females while in country (GE 2).\nIn October 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. He reported that\nhe admitted the security violation in May 2006, because he believed he was the last\nperson to leave the office the evening before, and that he neglected to retrieve the hard\ndrive from the computer and secure it (GE 3). This was a lie.\n\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant provided a slightly different explanation about the May\n2006 security violation incident (Tr. 14). He claimed that he presented information \u201coff\nthe record\u201d to the RSO. He also claimed that contractors were not in favor at the\nembassy (Tr. 15). Applicant retold events in a different sequence concerning his\nknowledge of the security violation and the pink slip. His explanations were confusing\nand self-serving at the hearing (Tr. 16). He emphasized that he remained at the\nembassy for at least a few months after the May 2006 incident. He also served in\nanother country on assignment after that. However, Applicant admitted that he misled\nthe RSO during the 2006 investigation in the Embassy (Tr. 87).\nRegarding the prostitution allegations, Applicant explained at the hearing that he\ndid not recall whether a male or female was in the bed with him at the party in his co-\nworker\u2019s home (Tr. 44). This account differs from his statement to the RSO in 2006. He\nwas adamant at the hearing that regardless, it was not a prostitute (Tr. 45). At the\nhearing, he maintained that he had no idea whether he engaged in sexual intercourse\nthat evening. Applicant said that he had told his wife about the incident at the party (Tr.\n52). However, he reported in one of his interviews, that his spouse was not aware of\nthat information.\nCharacter References\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance.\nHe applauded his diligence, ability and technical accomplishments (AE A). His\nsupervisor since 1998 describes Applicant as one of his best technicians who\nconsistently completes projects quickly and accurately. He possesses a professional\nattitude and bearing on and off duty. He is trustworthy in all endeavors. Applicant\npresented 25 letters of recommendation from colleagues (AE A).\nThe embassy official who counseled Applicant in May 2006 describes him as a\nhighly motivated individual who took great pride in his work during office hours and as\nan American representative working overseas. He further described Applicant as a\ndedicated professional and a valuable asset (AE A). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n5\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\n6\n(a) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\nApplicant admitted to having sex with prostitutes in a foreign country, and then\nsaid he lied to please the investigator. He changed his story about being in a bed with\nan unknown male or female in country. He said he did not remember. He admitted that\nhe provided false material information to the RSO in country in 2006, when he accepted\nresponsibility for a security violation. He gave another description of the security\nviolation incident in a 2008 sworn affidavit. He lied to DOHA when he said he was\nresponsible for the security violation. He did not report the security violation of his co-\nworker. A person may wish to conceal this conduct, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s\nprofessional and community standing.\nThe mitigating condition outline in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d\npartially applies because he disclosed all of is misconduct to security officials. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information\nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected\ninformation, \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual's\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such\ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\u201d\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information; and\nApplicant acknowledged that he falsely took responsibility for his co-worker\u2019s\nsecurity violation in 2006. He lied to an investigator about the incident. He did not\ndisclose his co-worker\u2019s security violation until 2008 even though he knew that he had a\nduty to report the violation. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) applies to the security\nviolation issue.\nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so\ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of\nsecurity responsibilities; and\n() the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\nAfter considering the mitigating conditions, I find that none of them apply to this\ncase. Applicant was not credible at the hearing. His various descriptions of the security\nviolation and his involvement with a prostitute in a foreign country while serving as a\ncontractor show he is not trustworthy. Although Applicant had never had any difficulty\nprior to this time, his admissions of lying at various times to investigators and his\nsomewhat incredible testimony regarding a male or female who slept next to him in a\nroom at a party casts grave doubt on his judgment and reliability.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that the mitigating\nconditions are not sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature,\nwell-educated professional. He served in a professional capacity for his entire career.\nHe has held an interim clearance. He is highly regarded by his employer and\ncolleagues. He is a man who has provided for his family. He loves this country. He\nwants to continue with his employment.\nApplicant\u2019s training provided him with the requisite knowledge concerning\nreporting security violations. While he may have been confused at the beginning of the\nsecurity investigation by the 2006 pink slip, he accepted responsibility for a violation that\nhe did not commit. He lied to investigators. He provided inconsistent statements several\ntimes. He admits that he wanted to please people and did not tell the truth. He did not\nreport that a co-worker was the cause of the security violation until 2008. His comments\nat the hearing were less than candid. He did not demonstrate good judgment. I have\ndoubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his personal conduct and handling protected information. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline K\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 11, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 8, 2007. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 25 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1999 through at least\nJanuary 1, 2007. He also purchased it.\nIn about June 2002, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Possession of\nMarijuana and (2) Underage Possession of Alcohol. He was placed in a Diversion\nProgram and ordered to perform community service.\nApplicant executed a Public Trust Position Application (PTPA) in September\n2005 and a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP) in August 2007.\nApplicant admitted to marijuana use on both documents.\nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator in March 2007. During the\ninterview, applicant stated he \u201chas no current plans of stopping usage of marijuana. . . .\u201d\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\n\nAt the time the SOR was issued, 10 U.S.C. 986 was the statute that prohibited an unlawful user of a\n1\ncontrolled substance from holding a security clearance. On January 1, 2008, this statute was repealed by,\nand replaced with, 50 U.S.C. 435 (b). The new statute has the same prohibition.\n3\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying. Under\nParagraph \n25.c., \n\u201cillegal \ndrug \npossession, \nincluding \ncultivation, \nprocessing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . .\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph\n25.h., an \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s use and\npurchase of marijuana, and his March 2007 statement that he has no current plans to\nstop using marijuana, raise these three disqualifying conditions.\nIn addition to the AG, current law specifically prohibits the granting of a security\nclearance to an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d  For purposes of this\n1\nprohibition, an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d is a person who uses a\ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of\nthe controlled substance, or is a person who is a current user of the controlled\nsubstance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician. Because the\nevidence does not support a finding that applicant has lost his self-control with respect\nto his marijuana use, or that he has used marijuana during the past year or so, I\nconclude he does not meet the definition of \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n\n4\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has used marijuana for\nmany years. Although he has had the opportunity to foreswear future use of this illegal\ndrug, he has chosen to do the opposite by stating, in effect, he will continue to use it.\nThis reflects adversely on his current judgment and reliability. Based on the foregoing, I\nconclude that applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guideline H.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 27, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology\n\n2\nSystems) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 6, 2008, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether Applicant\u2019s allegation of\nineffective assistance of counsel constitutes error; whether Department Counsel\u2019s introduction of\ncertain evidence was in bad faith and therefore a violation of due process; and whether the Judge\ncommitted error in his findings and conclusions.  \nThe Judge made the following factual findings:  Between March 2005 and May 2006,\nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor as an information technology technician.  In\naddition to his normal duties, Applicant offered to develop a computer program to help the\ncontractor manage its projects.  Applicant\u2019s program contained passwords and codes, including\nsource and expiration codes, which the company had not required and which Applicant did not\ninitially share with his employer.  At one point, an expiration code triggered automatically and\ncaused a database to stop working.  Applicant was subsequently told he would be fired if he did not\nsupply the passwords and codes to his employer, which he had initially refused to do.  At another\npoint, Applicant deliberately deleted a folder containing some of the codes, although he was able to\nreconstruct the codes during the next ten days.  Applicant eventually provided some of the\ninformation after he was reminded that he had signed a Patent and Trade Secret Agreement which\nrequired him to do so.  Applicant was let go as part of a reduction in force.  \nIn March 2006, Applicant filed a complaint against his employer alleging discrimination,\nharassment, and other types of misconduct by his supervisors.  After he was let go, Applicant filed\na complaint alleging that he lost his job in retaliation for his earlier complaint.  Applicant testified\nthat his complaints were still being investigated, but in September 2006 an investigation by the\nDepartment of the Army concluded that there was no basis for Applicant\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing\nby his supervisors.  Decision at 3.  In April 2007, the Army Inspector General concluded that\nApplicant lost his job due to reduced manpower needs and Applicant\u2019s unprofessional conduct.\nDecision at 4. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant repeats the arguments he made at the hearing.  His appeal also\ncontains a series of e-mails, including an e-mail exchange in November 2007 between Applicant and\nthe Government Accountability Office (GAO).  To the extent the brief contains evidence not\npresented at the hearing, it proffers new evidence, which the Board may not consider on appeal.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIneffective assistance of counsel is not a basis for appeal.  DOHA proceedings are civil, not\ncriminal, in nature, and the ineffective assistance of counsel doctrine does not apply to them.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0515 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999); ISCR Case No. 96-0127 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 29, 1997).  The actions or inactions of Applicant\u2019s hearing lawyer do not provide a basis for the\nBoard to conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision should be reversed or remanded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 01-07629 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2002).\n\n\u201c. . . the decision was based off of submitted evidence that may or may not have pertained to my Federal Fraud\n1\ncases and also all evidence submitted by the prosecution was not presented in its full process leading the administrative\njudge not to believe my testimony when given.\u201d\nThe complaints were not part of the SOR allegations against Applicant.  However, Applicant contends that the\n2\ncomplaints at least indirectly caused the dispute with his employer which, in his view at least, led to the SOR allegations.\n3\n \nWhile the language in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is not clear, it appears that he is arguing that\nDepartment Counsel acted in bad faith in introducing certain evidence pertaining to Applicant\u2019s two\ncomplaints against his employer and that Applicant was thereby denied due process.   There is a\n1\nrebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties in good faith.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21329 at 1 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2006).  A party seeking to rebut that\npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that burden,\nbecause he has not identified anything in the record that suggests a basis for a reasonable person to\nconclude that Department Counsel acted improperly.  Applicant\u2019s two complaints, one to GAO in\nMarch 2006 and one to the DoD IG in April 2007, were a source of confusion.   It appears that the\n2\nGAO complaint was investigated at least in part by the Inspector General of the Army (Army IG).\nAmong the government\u2019s exhibits, Department Counsel submitted documents stating that the\ninvestigation of the first complaint by the Army IG was closed, at least as to the issues listed, and\nthat the investigation by the DoD IG was closed.  Department Counsel gave copies of those\ndocuments to Applicant before the hearing.  Applicant had the opportunity to refute those\ndocuments.  Applicant also had the opportunity to supplement the record if he felt that Department\nCounsel\u2019s documentary submissions were incomplete or misleading.  It appears that Applicant had\nwritten evidence from GAO before his hearing that the investigation of his first complaint was still\nongoing, but he did not submit it.  Furthermore, when Applicant testified that the GAO investigation\nwas still open, he did not indicate that he had documentation for his assertion.  Applicant also states\nthat he was assured by two sources that the investigation of the second complaint was still open, but\nhe did not document or submit that information for the hearing.  Applicant has not demonstrated\ndenial of due process.     \nApplicant cites sections from the Judge\u2019s decision which he asserts contain  errors.  Applicant\ndoes identify one factual error:  the Judge stated that in 2007 Applicant filed a complaint with the\nArmy IG, while Applicant actually filed that complaint with the DoD IG.  That error is harmless,\nsince that fact alone would not affect the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions.  Applicant states his\ndisagreement with other portions of the Judge\u2019s decision, but those portions involve the Judge\u2019s\ncharacterization and weighing of the evidence.  Applicant\u2019s explanations of his actions were relevant\nand material evidence that the Judge had to consider.  However, the Judge was not bound to accept\nApplicant\u2019s explanations at face value.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s\nstatements in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-20579 at 5 (App.\nBd. Apr. 14, 2004).  The fact that Applicant does not agree with the Judge\u2019s findings and\nconclusions, or can offer an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, does not establish error\non the part of the Judge. \n\n4\nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\nhas drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse decision.  See Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  The Judge\u2019s\nfinding that Applicant wrongfully denied his employer and the U.S. Army access to a necessary\ncomputer program and his ultimate conclusion that Applicant was ineligible for a security clearance\nare sustainable. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant was responsible for installation, support, and\nmaintenance of various communications and IT equipment and systems.\nOn March 29, 2005, when Applicant was hired, he signed a \u201cPatent and Trade\nSecret Agreement.\u201d The agreement states provides that, as a condition of his\nemployment, Applicant agreed \u201cto disclose promptly to the Company all inventions,\ndiscoveries and improvements made by [Applicant] during [his] employment,\u201d and that\n\u201cany and all notes, tapes, discs, fiche, film, records and drawings made or kept by\n[Applicant] of the work performed in connection with [his] employment or in relation to\n\n3\nany of said inventions, discoveries or improvements, were and are the sole property of\nthe Company.\u201d (Gx. 3, Tab A)\nAbout a month after Applicant arrived in Iraq, he offered to improve an internal\ntracking and reporting data base his company used to manage tasks required of them\nby the Army. For example, a request would come in for the company to fix something at\na building in Baghdad. That request would be put into the data base with a date\nassigned and date due for completion. The company would use the data base to help\nmanage its resources and track the progress of its tasks when reporting to the Army\nabout its efforts. Applicant told his managers he could create a program that would be\nmore robust and, thus, more useful in that effort. Applicant spent about a month writing\nthe code and assembling the software needed to create the program. By all accounts,\nthe program proved very useful to Applicant\u2019s company.\nApplicant placed in the program a code that would cause the program to expire\nsometime in April 2006. The expiration code was not requested by his company.\nApplicant explained that, in building the data base program, he had used parts of other\nprograms he had built while in school or at earlier jobs, and the expiration code was\nalready included with some of those parts. Applicant also assigned a password to the\nprogram, which he initially kept to himself. Applicant also kept to himself the source\ncodes, which provide a measure of security so that only the programmer or other\nauthorized persons may access the program to modify or repair it.\nAs a result of a 1992 accident in which he suffered a severe head injury,\nApplicant has had a disability that impairs his speech and mobility. He is not at all\ncognitively impaired, but his condition manifests itself in speech and coordination\nchallenges similar to those exhibited by persons with cerebral palsy. Beginning in late\n2005, Applicant began having trouble with his managers, as he felt they were\ndiscriminating against or harassing him because of his physical disabilities. On March 9,\n2006, he filed a complaint using the Government Accountability Office\u2019s (GAO) Fraud\nNet web site. He alleged various acts of discrimination and harassment, as well as\nracial discrimination and harassment of minority co-workers. He also alleged various\nacts of waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct by his supervisors. \nApplicant testified that his claims are still being investigated by GAO. However,\non September 26, 2006, a Department of the Army investigation of his complaints\nconcluded there was no basis for Applicant\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing by his\nsupervisors. (Gx. 3, Tab D)\nOn April 24, 2006, the expiration code caused the data base to stop working. A\nmessage appeared stating that the \u201cprogram trial period\u201d had expired and referred the\nuser to Applicant. At the time this occurred, he was not available and no one else had\nthe source codes or passwords needed to access the program to effect repairs.\nApplicant was eventually located and he fixed the immediate problem. However, this\nevent made clear to his supervisors that they needed the codes and passwords to avoid\nsuch problems in the future. \n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n4\nIn a meeting on April 26, 2006, Applicant was asked to remove the expiration\ncode and to provide all information (codes, passwords, software, etc.) necessary for the\ncompany to manage the program without having to rely on one person to solve\nproblems. Applicant refused to provide the information, becoming upset and belligerent\nover the request. He demanded compensation for the program and claimed he was\nowed back overtime pay by the company. At one point, because he was angry about his\ncircumstances at the company, he deliberately deleted a folder containing the source\ncodes for the program. He was able to reconstruct the codes over the next ten days. On\nApril 28, 2006, Applicant was told he would be terminated for his refusal to comply with\nthe company\u2019s requests; however, a written notice of termination was not signed or\nacted on. \nApplicant was twice reprimanded in May 2006 for his behavior in the workplace\nand for his refusal to provide the program information. Also in May 2006, Applicant was\nnotified he would be let go as part of a reduction in force that also affected about 60\nother employees. Applicant eventually provided some of the information requested, but\nonly after he was reminded of the Patent and Trade Secret Agreement he had signed.\nHis employer also intended to withhold a performance bonus due to Applicant if he did\nnot comply with their requests.\nApplicant\u2019s last day in Iraq was May 12, 2006, and he ended his employment\nwith the company on May 17, 2006. On May 26, 2006, the data base program crashed\nand the company had to resort to a manual tracking system. A subsequent review\nestimated the cost of Applicant\u2019s actions and the labor required to restore or recreate\nthe functional equivalent of the automated tracking system at about $190,000. (Gx. 3,\nTab C)\nAfter he was laid-off, Applicant filed a complaint with the Department of the Army\nInspector General. He alleged he was terminated from his employment in reprisal for his\nearlier complaint to GAO. On April 17, 2007, the Army Inspector General concluded\nthere was no reprisal, as Applicant\u2019s \u201ctermination was based on ... reduced manpower\nrequirements... and [Applicant\u2019s] documented unprofessional conduct.\u201d (Gx. 6)\nApplicant\u2019s record at the company where he has worked since October 2006 is\nexcellent. Several government, military, and company associates and superiors have\nlauded his efforts and expertise. His performance appraisals reflect superior work and a\ngreat deal of potential for continued success. (Ax. A - V)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\n\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n5\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under Guideline M (misuse of information technology systems), at\nAG \u00b6 39, and Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nMisuse of Information Technology Systems.\nUnder Guideline M, \u201c[n]oncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related  computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39). The government presented sufficient information\n\n6\nto support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The latter two allegations simply\nplead supporting evidence, and are not, by themselves, disqualifying. However, taken\ntogether with SOR \u00b6 1.a, they address the gravamen of this case; namely, the security\nramifications of Applicant\u2019s apparent willingness to deny access to a computer program\nneeded by his employer and, more importantly, by the U.S. Army. Further, the\ninformation presented requires consideration of the disqualifying condition listed at AG \u00b6\n40(b) (illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial of access\nto information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information technology system)\n(emphasis added).\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant has argued for a different interpretation of the\ninformation in Gx. 3. He insists he did nothing wrong in managing the program, that he\nwas the victim of harassment and discrimination, and that the information presented\nshould be viewed as his former employer\u2019s way of getting even with him for his GAO\ncomplaints. However, in weighing the available information, I am more persuaded by\nthe e-mails and correspondence in Gx. 3 that was generated at or near the time of the\nevents in question than I am by Applicant\u2019s more current interpretation of those same\nevents. To accept Applicant\u2019s argument is to conclude, which I do not, that the authors\nof those e-mails and other correspondence had in mind an organized effort to get back\nat him. The more plausible interpretation of this information is that, because Applicant\nwas frustrated with his circumstances, he used the program he had developed as\nleverage against his employer, who he felt had mistreated him and denied him proper\ncompensation. \nThe record does not support consideration of any of the Guideline M mitigating\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 41. This conduct was recent and Applicant has not\ndemonstrated how his actions do not reflect adversely on his \u201creliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 41(a)) Indeed, his actions show a willingness to use his\ntechnical expertise to protect his own interests, even at the expense of the\ngovernment\u2019s war effort. Nor does the record show Applicant\u2019s conduct constituted a\nminor transgression (AG \u00b6 41(b)). The estimated damage from Applicant\u2019s actions was\nnearly $200,000. Finally, his conduct was not unintentional or inadvertent. Rather than\ntry to correct the situation, Applicant only partially complied with his employer\u2019s requests\nafter being threatened with termination. (AG \u00b6 41(c)). Applicant\u2019s information about what\nmay or may not have occurred in the workplace is insufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns about his conduct.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nApplicant may not be disqualified under Guideline E for the SOR \u00b6 2.a allegation. While\nthe record shows he misused information technology systems as alleged, such conduct\nis specifically covered under Guideline M and must be addressed according to AG \u00b6\n40(b), as discussed above. \n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n7\nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, available information requires consideration of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 16(f) (violation of a written or recorded commitment made by\nthe individual to the employer as a condition of employment). Applicant tried to renege\non a written agreement he signed when he was hired. That agreement addressed his\nemployer\u2019s interest in any work product generated by its employees while engaged in its\nbusiness and using its resources. It was clearly a condition of his employment.\nApplicant tried to evade its restrictions and would surely have done so had his employer\nnot insisted on trying to enforce the agreement so the program Applicant had\nconstructed could continue to be used to support the government. For the same\nreasons discussed under Guideline M, above, the record does not warrant\nconsideration of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG 17.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines M and E. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult whose recent job performance has been exemplary.\n9\nHowever, the positive information about Applicant is insufficient to overcome the\nadverse information about his conduct at his previous job. Because access to classified\ninformation is increasingly intertwined with automated information technology systems,\ndeliberately impeding the government\u2019s ability to use those systems in support of the\nnational interest is conduct that has significant security ramifications. This is especially\nso when assessing the suitability of one who has access by virtue of his technical\nexpertise. Despite Applicant\u2019s recent conduct, doubts persist about whether, if his\ncircumstances again turn sour, he will again try to leverage his technical expertise for\nhis own interests. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.  \n10\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Jones, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Tom Rogers, Esquire\n----------------------------\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 1,\n2006. On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 24, 2007. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on August 29, 2007, and requested\na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided\nApplicant with a complete copy on October 29, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\n\nGov E 5 (Interrogatory with attachments); Response to FORM, dated November 13, 2007.\n1\nGov E 4 (SF-86) at 6, 11-14, 21-22.\n2\n2\nNovember 9, 2007. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a response, dated\nNovember 13, 2007. The hearing office assigned this case to me on January 15, 2008.\nThe government submitted eight exhibits, which have been marked as Gov E 1-8 and\nadmitted into the record. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings and exhibits,\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H. His\neligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nUnder the procedural guidance rules of the Directive, the government cannot\nsubmit documents from the Report of Investigation (ROI), without an authenticating\nwitness. In the instant case, the government, through counsel, mailed Applicant\nInterrogatories, which included a copy of the summary of his unsworn personal\ninterview with the investigator. Because this document is part of the ROI, the Directive\nprohibits the government from using this document as evidence without an\nauthenticating witness. (Directive E1 Section 5(a) and \u00b6 E.3.1.20). \nThe ROI document may be admitted into the record if the Applicant waives his\nright to object to its admission as evidence. In the instant case, Interrogatory number 2\nrequested the Applicant to review the summary report of his interview and authenticate\nthe report, which he did when he responded yes to Interrogatory number 3. He then\nswore under oath that this information was true and correct to the best of his\nknowledge. Applicant did not object to the admission of this document in his response\ndated November 13, 2007.  I find that Applicant waived his right to exclude this\n1\nevidence, which is admitted into the record.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d of the SOR, with explanation.\nApplicant is 27 years old. Applicant graduated from college with a Bachelor of\nScience degree in May 2003. He received a Masters of Science degree in July 2004.\nHe started his employment with a defense contractor in August 2004. When he\naccepted this job, he relocated to a different part of the country from where he lived and\nattended college. He married his long-time girlfriend in July 2005.  In August 2006, his\nemployer promoted him to his current position of senior technical account manager. He\ncompleted his SF-86 in December 2006, after being promoted.2\nIn 1997, while still a high school student, Applicant smoked his first marijuana\ncigarette with friends in a private home. For the next two years, he and his friends\n\nGov E 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR) at 3-4; Gov E 5, supra note 1, at 2.\n3\nId.\n4\nGov E 5, supra note 1, at 2-3.\n5\nId. at 3; Gov E 3, supra note 3, at 3; Response to FORM at 1.\n6\nGov E 3, supra note 3, at 3-4.\n7\n3\nsmoked marijuana two to four times a month in a social setting. He never purchased\nany marijuana during this time. The marijuana made him feel relaxed, mellow or\nsometimes paranoid. During this same period of time, he experimented with\nhallucinogenic mushrooms four times. As with marijuana, he used the hallucinogenic\nmushrooms at a party with friends.3\nAfter starting college in 1999, he gradually increased his use of marijuana.\nDuring his last year of undergraduate school and while pursuing his masters degree, he\nused marijuana daily to relieve stress. He purchased marijuana for his own use during\nthis same time period.4\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana decreased significantly once he completed his\neducation and moved to another area of the country. He did not know where to\npurchase marijuana after he moved. He also concluded that he could not afford to\npurchase the drug for his personal use on a regular basis. From August 2004 through\nMay 2006, he used marijuana once very two to three months. His girlfriend, now his\nwife, provided him with marijuana in 2004. In May 2006 he purchased marijuana which\nhe and his wife smoked at home over the next month. He decided after this use that he\ncould no longer afford to purchase marijuana and that he would not use it.5\nIn August 2004, he again experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms. His use\ncaused him to become extremely paranoid and visually hallucinate. He lost control of\nhimself and passed out. When he awakened, he decided he would not use this drug\nagain. He has not. He has no intent to use hallucinogenic mushrooms or marijuana in\nthe future, a statement he has made twice in writing. He denies that he has a drug\nproblem and insists he is not a drug abuser.6\nApplicant and his wife purchased a house. He performs yard work and home\nprojects when he is stressed. He also exercises and travels to help relieve his stress.\nHe has a healthy support system with his family, wife, friends and colleagues, who are\nnot drug users. Marijuana or other illegal drug use would negatively impact his future.7\nApplicant has not served in the military. He has no arrest record or financial\nproblems. He willing admitted to his drug use on his SF-86, estimating his use of\n\nGov E 4, supra note 2.\n8\n4\nmarijuana at approximately 300 times. I find that Applicant has been forthcoming and\ntruthful about his drug use in the security clearance process.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions do not apply in this case.\n9\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in\nAG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that are relevant to this case, could raise a\nsecurity concern, and may be disqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.9\nApplicant began smoking marijuana as a high school student. He continued\nsmoking marijuana in college and gradually increased his use of marijuana until he used\nit on a daily basis. He also experimented on five occasions with Hallucinogenic\nmushrooms. He purchased marijuana as a college student and most recently in May\n2006. He never purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms. To smoke marijuana or use the\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, he had to possess them. Because of Applicant\u2019s drug use,\nthe above disqualifying conditions apply.\n\nThe remaining mitigating conditions are not raised in this case.\n10\n6\nAG \u00b6 26 provides one condition that could mitigate security concerns:\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.10\nApplicant\u2019s use of hallucinogenic mushrooms stopped after his last use in 2004,\nwhen he experienced serious problems with this drug. In August 2004, he moved many\nmiles from his home and friends. He changed his life style and his methods for dealing\nwith stress. He uses physical activity, such as exercise and yard work, to reduce his\nstress. He travels, which is another means of relaxing.  He has developed new friends\nwho have a different life style from his friends at home and in college. With his new\nfriends, drugs are not an issue. He has not smoked marijuana in more than 18 months\nand has twice stated in writing that he does not intend to smoke marijuana or use any\nillegal drugs in the future.  AG \u00b6 26 (b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s actions\nclearly demonstrate his intent not to use drugs in the future as a means to cope with\nstress or for recreational purposes. This mitigating conditions is not fully applicable\nbecause he has not agreed to the automatic revocation of a clearance for any violation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant regularly used marijuana\n\nThe Directive does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d\n11\nconduct. ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (Judge did not err by concluding drug use\nnot recent with passage of slightly less than two and a half years between last use and hearing) (citing ISCR\nCase No. 02-10454 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004)).  See ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999)\n(not error for Judge to find that last marijuana use nine months before close of record was not recent).\n7\nfor seven years, initially when socializing with friends. For two years, he used it daily to\nrelieve stress. His high level of marijuana use was abusive and serious. He voluntarily\nchose to smoke marijuana and to experiment with hallucinogenic mushrooms. When he\nmade this decision, he knew these drugs were illegal.\nWhen he completed his education and moved away from family and friends in\n2004, he significantly reduced his use of marijuana. His decision in June 2006 to abstain\nfrom smoking marijuana or using any other illegal drugs is not recent.  He credibly\n11\nstated that he did not intend to use drugs in the future. Applicant made poor decisions\nas a teenager about drugs. When he matured and became a member of the working\nworld, he learned that drug abuse could have very negative consequences for his\nfuture. He changed his lifestyle and his friends. The one person still closely involved in\nhis life who smoked marijuana with him is his wife. Although he has not explicitly stated\nthat his wife no longer uses drugs, I find his statement that his current associates are\nnon-drug users to also include his wife. Applicant voluntarily provided all the information\nthe government knows about his drug use. He did not try to minimize his past drug use\nduring his personal interview or on his SF-86. Because he has been straight forward\nand candid about his drug usage, I find his statements about abstaining from drug use\nnow and in the future credible. There is little likelihood that he will resume his past drug\nactivities and use illegal drugs. Since he has been open about his past drug use, the\npotential for pressure for coercion, exploitation, or duress because of his past drug use\ndoes not exist. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his\ndrug involvement.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n                                                   \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant admitted all Guideline F allegations, denied the lone\nGuideline E allegation, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 21, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 7, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 3, 2008. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled.

That objection was sustained and the remainder\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJuly 8, 2008\n\n2\nof GE 5 was admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted\nseven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-7, and\nadmitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on June 18, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 25 years old, She is employed by a staffing agency and assigned under\na contract to a defense contractor where she has worked as a claims analyst since March\n2006. She graduated from high school in June 2000. She thereafter attended college and\nwas awarded a bachelor of arts degree with a major in psychology in December 2005.\nApplicant worked sporadically at fast food restaurants while attending high school and\ncollege. Following her college graduation, she worked for short periods of time in a factory\nand in meat processing plants. \nApplicant is single and has one child, age 6. The child\u2019s father has been court-\nordered to pay $180 per month as child support. He has failed to make an undetermined\nnumber of support payments over the years but Applicant testified she has not bothered\nto attempt to collect the arrearage owing. (Tr. 31-32)\nThe SOR alleges nine credit card debts, totaling approximately $16,000, and one\ntelephone account, owing in the amount of $1,600, that have either been charged off or\nsubmitted for collection. These accounts have been delinquent for many years. Applicant\nacquired this debt while she was attending school. She testified she never made any\npayment on some of the credit cards she acquired and used. (Tr. 37) She did not take any\naction to resolve these debts but instead chose to rely upon the passage of time for them\nto be removed from her credit reports. None of these accounts are listed in her most recent\ncredit report. (AE 2)\nThe SOR also alleges eight medical bills, totaling approximately $1,700, that have\nbeen submitted for collection. Each of these debts has been delinquent for many years.\nApplicant testified she believes some of these accounts do not belong to her and the\nremainder should have been paid by medical insurance. (Tr. 34-37) She did nothing to\nsatisfy or otherwise resolve any of these accounts until shortly before the hearing when she\ncalled a credit reporting service to dispute her liability for the accounts. She testified that\nif the challenge to her liability for these accounts is successful they will be removed from\nher credit reports about 45 days after the date of the hearing. (Tr. 34)\nApplicant consulted with a consumer credit counseling service a few weeks before\nthe hearing. However, she has not actually entered into a contractual agreement with the\nservice and she doesn\u2019t have the disposable income needed to comply with the plan the\nservice proposed on her behalf.  \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) in March\n2006. In response to a question inquiring whether she was then over 180 days delinquent\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n2\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n3\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n4\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n5\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n6\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n3\non any financial obligation, she answered \u201cNo\u201d. This answer was untrue. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations for her untrue answer is: 1) she was in a hurry; 2) she did not read the\nquestion carefully; 3) she had read an earlier question inquiring about whether she had\never filed for bankruptcy protection to which she correctly answered \u201cNo\u201d; and 4) she\nsomehow inexplicably concluded that because she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the bankruptcy\nquestion she should also answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question. \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n2\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.3\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n4\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.5\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.6\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n7\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n8\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant either has or had numerous delinquent accounts, totalling over $19,000,\nthat were either charged off or submitted for collection. She acquired and used credit cards\nwhen she clearly lacked the financial resources to make payments on the accounts. She\nnever made any payment on some of the credit card accounts. All of her delinquent\naccounts remained delinquent for many years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; DC 19(b): indebtedness caused by frivolous spending or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the\ndebt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations apply.\nApplicant never took affirmative action to resolve any of her delinquent credit card\nor telephone debt. Instead, she chose to wait until they were removed from her credit\nreports through the passage of time. Most disturbing about her conduct in regards to that\ndebt is that she acquired at least some of the credit cards lacking both the ability and intent\nto make payment on them. As to the medical expenses, she failed to take any action to\nresolve them until shortly before the hearing, and it is unknown whether or not the\nchallenges to those debts will be resolved in her favor. While she discussed her financial\nsituation with a consumer credit counselling service, she has not engaged that service and\nlacks the financial ability to make the payments that would be required under the plan the\nservice proposed. \nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol  . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and 20(d): the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not\napply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts in this case.\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n5\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the (sensitive position eligibility) process or any failure to cooperate with\nthe (sensitive position eligibility) process.\nApplicant submitted an SF 85P in March 2006, and in response to a question\ninquiring whether she was then over 180 days delinquent on any financial obligation she\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d. This answer was untrue. Her assertions about why she did not report the\ndelinquent debts, namely: 1) she was in a hurry; 2) she did not read the question carefully;\n3) she had read an earlier question inquiring about whether she had ever filed for\nbankruptcy protection to which she correctly answered \u201cNo\u201d; and 4) she somehow\ninexplicably concluded that because she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the bankruptcy question she\nshould also answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question are not credible. In making that determination, I\nhave considered the substance of her testimony, her appearance and demeanor while\ntestifying, and the nature of the debts in question. Applicant is clearly an intelligent woman\nwith the capacity to read and understand the question at issue and discern the information\nshe was required to furnish. DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, of\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities applies. I have considered all mitigating conditions under\nGuideline E and find none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.   \n \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. She has not\novercome the case against her nor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to sensitive\ninformation. Guidelines F and E are decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-r:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old. He was married in 1987, and divorced in 2001. He currently is involved in a spouse-like relationship. His security applications (SCAs), Items 4, 5, and 6, show he has been employed as a property administrator with a defense contractor since 1985. He has held a security clearance since February 1987. He seeks a security clearance. The SOR includes six allegations under the personal conduct guideline, and one allegation under the criminal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following factual findings. SOR 1.a. On January 31, 2005, Applicant was interviewed as a part of the special access investigation with another agency of DoD. During this polygraph interview, he was asked if he had used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and his answer was \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant was re-interviewed using a polygraph the next day. He admitted using marijuana once in June 2004, but denied using the drug at any other time (Id.). He furnished false information in his January 31, 2005-interview about using marijuana because he was ashamed, and he did not want to jeopardize his employment and security clearance (Item 7). SOR 1.b.

Coacher, Esq. \nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his most recent Security Clearance Application (SCA), on\nMarch 15, 2006. On April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\npersonal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). The action was\ntaken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effectively within the Department of\nDefense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApplicant submitted his notarized answer to the SOR on May 11, 2008. He\nelected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. DOHA mailed a File\nof Relevant Material (FORM, information provided to an applicant to support the\nMarch 18, 2009\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nallegations of the SOR) to Applicant on December 30, 2008. He received the FORM on\nJanuary 5, 2009. His response was due on February 4, 2009. No response was\nsubmitted. I was assigned the case on March 3, 2009. \nRulings on Procedure\nSubparagraph 2.a. incorrectly identifies subparagraphs 2.a., 2.d., 2.e., and 2.f. to\nshow criminal behavior and/or rules violations. There is only one subparagraph under\nparagraph 2. Accordingly, the corrected references are subparagraphs 1.a., 1.d., 1.e.,\nand 1.f. as examples of Applicant omitting material information about his drug use from\nthe government during a security investigation. The corrections are made to remedy an\nadministrative oversight, and do not affect the substantive rights of the parties. The\nSOR shall be amended to conform the SOR to the evidence presented. See, Directive\nE3.1.17.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 48 years old. He was married in 1987, and divorced in 2001. He\ncurrently is involved in a spouse-like relationship. His security applications (SCAs),\nItems 4, 5, and 6, show he has been employed as a property administrator with a\ndefense contractor since 1985. He has held a security clearance since February 1987.\nHe seeks a security clearance. \nThe SOR includes six allegations under the personal conduct guideline, and one\nallegation under the criminal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. In\naddition to Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following factual findings. \nSOR 1.a. On January 31, 2005, Applicant was interviewed as a part of the\nspecial access investigation with another agency of DoD. During this polygraph\ninterview, he was asked if he had used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and his\nanswer was \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant was re-interviewed using a polygraph the next day. He\nadmitted using marijuana once in June 2004, but denied using the drug at any other\ntime (Id.). He furnished false information in his January 31, 2005-interview about using\nmarijuana because he was ashamed, and he did not want to jeopardize his employment\nand security clearance (Item 7). \nSOR 1.b. Applicant\u2019s special access application to another agency of DoD was\ndenied on May 3, 2005 (Item 9) because of his drug use in June 2004, when he was\nbeing sponsored for special access, and while he held a Top Secret security clearance.\nApplicant had also signed a DoD policy letter on February 25, 2004 acknowledging that\nthe use of illegal drugs while holding a security clearance was prohibited.\nSOR 1.c. Applicant admitted in his sworn statement dated October 25, 2007\n(Item 7), that he was aware of his responsibility to report his drug usage in June 2004,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nbut did not make the disclosure until advised by a representative of another agency of\nthe DoD. Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his drug use prompted an adverse information report\nbeing filed against him. \nSOR 1.d. In Applicant\u2019s sworn statement on October 25, 2007, he falsely stated\nthat his marijuana use in June 2004, which he reported in his March 21, 2006 SCA, was\nthe first time he admitted drug use on an SCA. In actuality, he admitted using marijuana\non three occasions: (1) in an SCA that he certified and signed on December 2, 1985\n(Item 6), he indicated he used marijuana about twice; (2) in a signed sworn statement\ndated January 24, 1986, Applicant recalled using marijuana about ten times between\n1974 and 1976; and, (3) in an SCA dated March 12, 1991, Applicant stated he used\nmarijuana once in the fall of 1976.\nSOR 1.e. In Applicant\u2019s signed statement of October 25, 2007, he specifically\ndenied using marijuana in the mid-1970s, or in the 1976-1977 time frame. He falsely\nclaimed he used marijuana on only one occasion in June 2004, and at no other time.\nSOR 1.f. In his SCA dated March 21, 2006, Applicant deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d\nto question 32, requiring a truthful response to having had a clearance or access\ndenied. Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his special access application was\ndenied by another agency of DoD in May 2005.  \nSOR 2.a. The deliberate omissions of information about his marijuana use in\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f., constitute a criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1001, a federal law. All factual allegations under SOR 1 and 2 are found against\nApplicant.\nCharacter Evidence\nOn December 30, 2008, Applicant was sent a copy of the FORM. In an\nexplanatory statement attached to the FORM, Applicant was advised he had 30 days to\nreply to the enclosed governmental exhibits, which the government intended to use to\nsubstantiate the SOR allegations. Also, he was advised he could object to the exhibits\nand/or other documents. He was advised he could access the Internet for decisions\nmade by DOHA Administrative Judges for guidance in the presentation of his case.\nFinally, Applicant was informed in the final paragraph of the December 30 letter to call\nDepartment Counsel if he had questions. Other than his admissions in his answer to the\nSOR on May 11, 2008, Applicant provided no information in response to the FORM. \nItems 4 (SCA, March 21, 2006), 5 (SCA, March 12, 1991), and 6 (SCA,\nDecember 1985) indicate Applicant has worked for his current employer since July\n1985. Sometime in the 1990s, Applicant\u2019s position was renamed from \u201csecurity\ncoordinator\u201d to \u201cproperty administrator.\u201d There is no information in the SCAs or in other\nlocations in the file describing Applicant\u2019s job responsibilities. Items 4, 5 and 6 also\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nprovide the names and addresses of seven individuals Applicant described as character\nreferences and/or individuals who know him well. Applicant supplied no other\ninformation about these individuals, and/or whether they are aware that he deliberately\nprovided false information about his drug use during his security investigation over the\nyears.\nPolicies\nAs set forth in Appendix 8 of the Regulation, every recommended personnel\nsecurity decision must be a fair and impartial, overall commonsense decision based on\nall available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The decision must be arrived at\nby applying the standard that the grant or continuance of a security clearance or access\nto classified information must be clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables in considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we\nshould view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and various\nother variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into account all\nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis. No unfavorable personnel security clearance or access determination may be\nmade without granting the individual concerned the procedural benefits set forth in the\nRegulation. See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nor sensitive information).\nIn all adjudications, the protection of the national security is the paramount\nconsideration. Therefore, any reasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered\nfor access to classified information must be resolved in favor of national security. In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on speculation or guesswork. \nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information from\nan SCA or an interview or a sworn statement. Whether an omission is intentional or\ndeliberate, depends on the circumstances of each case. Applicant admitted deliberately\nomitting material information about his marijuana use from a January 2005 interview, an\nOctober 2007 sworn statement, and a March 2006 SCA. Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nomissions to all subparagraphs under paragraph 1 completely undermine the\nbelievability of his statements describing his marijuana use over the years. His false\nstatements in interviews and sworn statements invoke PC DC 16.b. (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator or other official government representative). The false information he\nprovided in SCAs activates PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness). \nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) under the PC guideline that are\npotentially applicable to the circumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC\n17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment or falsification, before being confronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the\noffense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC\n17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change\nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur). PC MC 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant has not made\nany effort to provide the full scope of his drug history. Even though he was confronted a\nsecond time with a polygraph in January 2005, he furnished an incomplete account of\nhis drug history. He had an additional opportunity to set the record straight by\nresponding to the FORM, and declined. PC MC 17.a. does not apply. \nPC MC 17.c. is inapplicable because Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications were not\nisolated. Rather, they constituted a pattern of dishonesty dating to at least 1985, that\ncannot be credibly reconciled as minor. The second element of the condition cannot be\napplied as the most recent falsification occurred less than 18 months before January 5,\n2009, when Applicant received the FORM. \nRehabilitating dishonest behavior begins with accepting full responsibility for\none\u2019s conduct. The favorable mitigation Applicant receives under the first element of PC\nMC 17.d. in acknowledging the behavior is reduced by Applicant\u2019s decision not to\ndescribe the full scope and history of his drug use. Further, PC MC 17.d. calls for\nadditional evidence to be taken into consideration under the condition. Applicant has\npresented no evidence that demonstrates he has taken positive steps to prevent his\ndrug use from recurring. Without positive action to reduce the chances for drug use in\nthe future, there remains corresponding concerns about the recurrence of Applicant\u2019s\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\ndrug involvement as well as his vulnerability to pressure and coercion in the future. The\nPC guideline is found against Applicant. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30\nThe two disqualifying conditions under the CC guideline applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case are CC DC 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and CC DC 31.c. (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). On several\noccasions since 1986, Applicant intentionally omitted material information (information\nthe government has a legitimate right to know about to make an informed decision\nregarding an applicant\u2019s security suitability) about his drug use. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nomissions between 1991 and October 2007 represent felonious criminal conduct under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nI have carefully considered the mitigating conditions, however, I conclude that\nnone apply. CC MC 32.a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good\njudgment) does not apply since Applicant\u2019s most recent omission occurred less than 18\nmonths ago. Applicant\u2019s decision not to respond to the FORM continues to cast\nconcerns on his judgment and reliability. \nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) has only limited application. Though Applicant\u2019s October 2007-\nsworn statement reflects his remorse for lying about his drug use, that remorse did not\nstop him from continuing to provide false information about his drug history in his\nOctober 2007 statement. Though his tenure at his current employer of 23 years infers a\ngood employment record, that inference is tenuous without performance evaluations,\ncharacter endorsements, and certificates/awards praising his job performance.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct has not been mitigated.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nthe PC and CC guidelines. I have also weighed the circumstances of this case within\nthe context of nine variables known as the whole person concept: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nIn 1985, Applicant was 25 years old, and had just started working for the\npredecessor of his current employer. He stated in an SCA in December 1985 that he\ntried marijuana a couple of times. About a month \u00bd later, he stated he used the drug\nabout 10 times between 1974 and 1976. Yet, in an SCA in 1991, Applicant changed his\nstory (use only in the Fall of 1976) a third time in six years. In January 2005, Applicant\nprovided still a fifth account of using marijuana on only one occasion in June 2004,\nwhich he recounted in a sworn statement in October 2007. Though his October 2007\nclearly shows his understanding of the reporting requirements for security violations, he\nhas yet to demonstrate the commonsense rule of telling the truth about his drug use. By\npresenting no evidence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes, there appears to\nbe a likelihood of continuation or recurrence of his drug use that requires a finding\nagainst Applicant under the PC and CC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.f \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, (Guideline J): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nConclusion\\\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n                      \nPaul J.

He is a high school graduate who also has a certificate as a boilermaker and welder. He served briefly in the Army and received an Honorable Discharge based on hardship. He has been married twice with both marriages ending in divorce. He married his first wife in 1966. She left him and he divorced her in 1973. He has three grown children from his first marriage.

He submitted his latest \nsecurity clearance application on June 3, 2004, and his access to classified information \nwas continued.  He was involved in a serious criminal incident in 2006.  Based on this \nincident, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for Applicant for criminal conduct under \nGuideline J on August 13, 2008.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 19, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 2, 2008.  He admitted \nthree and denied two factual allegations as alleged in the SOR under Guideline J.  He \nprovided a detailed explanation of his actions which led to the 2006 criminal incident.  \nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 1, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nprepared to proceed on February 10, 2009.  The case was assigned to me on February \n23, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 24, 2009, for a hearing on \nMarch 19, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered six \ngovernment exhibits marked (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6 which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant submitted six Applicant Exhibits marked (App. Ex.) A through F \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant and one witness testified on his \nbehalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 26, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 63 year old operating engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor at an Air Force base since 1987.  He is a high school graduate who also has \na certificate as a boilermaker and welder.  He served briefly in the Army and received \nan Honorable Discharge based on hardship.  He has been married twice with both \nmarriages ending in divorce.  He married his first wife in 1966.  She left him and he \ndivorced her in 1973.  He has three grown children from his first marriage.  He was \ngranted custody of the children and his grandmother helped him raise the children (Tr. \n11-12, 16-19; Gov. Ex. 1, Security Clearance Application, dated June 3, 2004; \nApplicant's Additional Response to SOR, dated September 2, 2008).   \n \nApplicant admitted that he was arrested for having an open container of beer in \n1975.  He paid a $22 fine (SOR 1.a).  He denied that he was arrested for the same \noffense in 1976 (SOR 1.b).  Applicant noted an arrest for Open Container in \napproximately 1976 on his first security clearance application submitted on June 19, \n1987 (Gov. Ex. 4, Personnel Security Questionnaire, dated June 19, 1987).  On his \nsecond security clearance application submitted in 1989, Applicant listed an Open \nContainer offense in 1975 (Gov. Ex. 5, Personnel Security Questionnaire, dated July 26, \n1989).  Applicant again listed an Open Container offense in 1975 on his third security \nclearance application submitted in 1994 (Gov. Ex. 6, National Agency Questionnaire, \ndated February 14, 1994).  Applicant submitted a letter from the Clerk of the county \ncourt which stated that court records do not list charges for Open Container in either \n1975 or 1976 (See Response to SOR, dated September 2, 2008, Circuit Court Clerk \nLetter, dated August 27, 2008).  Since Applicant admitted to an arrest for Open \ncontainer in 1975, I find that he did commit the offense in 1975 and paid a fine.  I further \nfind that he provided a different date for the Open container offense on his 1987 security \nclearance application leading to confusion as to whether there were two offenses, one \nin 1975 and the other in 1976.  I find that the Open Container offense happened in \n1975, and there is insufficient evidence to establish an Open Container offense in 1976. \n \nApplicant denied that he had been arrested for trespassing in 1979.  Applicant \nnoted on two of his prior security clearance applications an arrest for trespassing in \n1980 and that the charges were either dropped or he paid a fine (Gov. Ex. 5, Personnel \nSecurity Questionnaire, dated July 26, 1989; Gov. Ex. 6, National Agency \nQuestionnaire, dated February 14, 1994).  The police records from the jurisdiction \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwhere the offense allegedly took place do not show an arrest for trespassing (See \nResponse to SOR, dated September 2, 2008, Police Letter, dated August 29, 2008).  \nBased on Applicant's admission in the security clearance applications, I find that the \ntrespassing arrest took place.  Since the charges were probably dropped, it is not \nsurprising that the police do not have a record of the arrest.  \n \nApplicant admitted that he was charged with aggravated assault in 1983. He was \nliving with the woman who would be his second wife when they had an argument about \nher not coming home.  They shoved each other but he did not strike her.  She filed a \ncomplaint with the police.  After they reconciled, his former wife told the police she did \nnot want to press charges, and charges were dropped in February 1984 after costs \nwere paid (See Response to SOR, dated September 2, 2008 at 1).   \n \nApplicant lived with his second wife from 1982 until they married in 1999.  She \nhad an affair with another man so Applicant divorced her in 2003.  His second wife \nmarried this other man.  Applicant was being verbally harassed, tormented, and publicly \nhumiliated at work by a fellow employee about his former wife's affair and why they \ndivorced.  Applicant told his tormentor to stop but the harassment and humiliation \ncontinued.  Applicant went to their supervisor asking for his tormentor to be moved.  \nHowever, the supervisor refused to stop the harassment.  \n \nIn 2005, Applicant became very ill.  He continued to have medical problems until \ndoctors discovered the cause of the medical problem and started appropriate treatment.  \nHowever, he was still feeling ill and the harassment by his co-worker continued.  In \nFebruary 2006, Applicant went to his human resource office and reported the \nharassment.  Human resource personnel promised to start an investigation.  However, \nApplicant and his tormentor had a verbal altercation and the tormentor filed a complaint \nagainst Applicant.  Applicant did not feel that the situation was being resolved so he \nasked the senior supervisor to relocate the tormentor.  The senior supervisor refused to \nreassign the tormentor and told Applicant just to stay away from the individual.  \nApplicant felt that no one would take action to assist him.  He felt he was alone in \nresolving the issue.  He was still ill and was unstable because of his divorce.  He was \nalso mentally distraught.   \n \nOn the night of March 10, 2006, Applicant went home and took an anti-anxiety \nmedication prescribed by his physician.  After about an hour, he did not feel the \nmedicine was working so he took another dose.  He also started drinking beer.  The \nwarning label on the medicine stated that taking alcohol in conjunction with the \nmedication may have an adverse effect.  Applicant is not a heavy drinker and had never \ntaken alcohol in conjunction with the anti-anxiety medicine in the past.  He does not \nrecall much that happened after taking the medicine and drinking beer. \n \nThe local police were called by Applicant's former wife's husband about 7 am on \nthe morning of March 11, 2006, about a man with a gun at their back door.  His former \nwife and her husband never left their house and did not confront the individual.  The \npolice arrived to find Applicant in the back yard with a loaded pistol and more \n\n \n4 \n \n \nammunition in his pocket.  He was arrested and taken to jail.  Applicant only remembers \nseeing a police officer pointing a gun at him.  Applicant was charged with aggravated \nassault, criminal trespass, reckless endangerment, and public intoxication (Tr. 16-46; \nGov. Ex. 3, Police Report and Indictment, dated March 11, 2006, and July 2006).  \n \nApplicant was placed in a pre-trial diversion program in lieu of a trial on \nSeptember 12, 2006, for two years, required to perform public service, pay a fine and \ncourt cost, and stay away from his former wife and her husband (Gov. Ex. 3, Agreed \nOrder, dated September 12, 2006, at 19).  Applicant completed his public service by \nDecember 2006, paid the fine and court cost, and completed his pretrial diversion \nprogram in September 2008 (App. Ex. F, Order of Expungement and Dismissal, dated \nSeptember 16, 2008). He has not seen his former wife or her husband since the \nincident.  In addition, he changed his shift at work to the day shift so he is no longer on \nthe same shift as his tormentor.  \n \nAt the time of the incident, Applicant's employer had him evaluated by a mental \nhealth counselor.  He informed the counselor about his problems at work, his former \nwife leaving him for another man, his illness, and the resulting mental condition.  The \ncounselor noted that Applicant's personality was more introverted than extroverted, that \nhe experienced a high degree of anxiety, and has a hard time with social skills.  He lets \nhis hurt turn to anger, broods over relationship failures, and has moderate to high \ndepressed feelings.  His arrest and the resulting charges were uncharacteristic.  The \ncounselor determined that Applicant did not pose a threat to himself or others, and was \ninsecure but a decent person.  He could benefit from some support from his supervisors \n(App. Ex. A, Report, dated March 31, 2006).  A counselor who saw him for about eight \nsessions from April 17, 2006, until July 6, 2006, noted he presented with symptoms of \ndepression and anxiety.  He was cooperative and willing to be responsible for his \nbehavior.  He was honest and true, hardworking, and willing to make adjustments.  He \nexhibited determination to do right (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated December 12, 2008). \n \nApplicant's son testified that he works for the same company at the same \nlocation as his father.  His father is a good person who raised him and his sisters as a \nsingle parent with help from his grandmother.  His father's 2006 actions were out of \ncharacter and caused by the stress at work combined with the medicine and alcohol.  \nHis father is not a drinker and only occasionally has a beer or two.   He is well liked by \neveryone.  His co-workers and supervisors think highly of him.  His father's tormentor \nhas a reputation at work of being an agitator who stirs up conflicts and troubles (Tr. 46-\n49).  \n \nApplicant's supervisor stated that Applicant was always good to work with and \ncooperative with supervisors and fellow workers.  His only problem was the one he had \nwith his tormentor.  He had a good working relationship with Applicant before and after \nApplicant's problems with the tormentor.  Applicant continues to be a good worker (App. \nEx. C, Letter, undated).  Applicant latest evaluation report shows he is a good employee \nwith a middle evaluation score (App. Ex. D, Evaluation, dated September 19, 2007). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).  Appellant admitted that he was \n\n \n6 \n \n \narrested for having an open alcohol container in 1975, for trespassing in 1979, and for \nassault in 1983.  He admits he was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, \ncriminal trespass, reckless endangerment, unlawful possession of a weapon, and public \nintoxication in 2006.  The government must establish by substantial evidence \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence \nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all \nthe contrary evidence in the record (See, directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \n(App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006)).  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F. 3d 375, 380 (4th \nCir. 1994)).  The government, based on Applicant's admissions and the fact that he was \narrested and charged with criminal offenses, has established by substantial evidence \nfour of the criminal offenses alleged in the SOR.  They did not establish the offense of \npossession of an open container in 1976.  The facts admitted by Applicant raise \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) \"a single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses\", and CD DC \u00b6 31(c) \"allegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted\".  The alleged offenses are serious.  Even though charges may not have been \nprosecuted, or findings of not guilty entered, or charges dismissed, they are still \nallegations of criminal conduct that raise a security concern.  \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the illegal drug use (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15).  An \napplicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)).   \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) \"so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; CC MC \u00b6 \n32(b) \"the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life\"; and CC MC \u00b6 32(d) \"there is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\".  The \n1975 open container arrest, the 1979 trespassing arrest, and 1983 assault charge \noccurred 26 to 34 years ago.  The extensive passage of time since the offenses were \ncommitted is sufficient to show that the acts are unlikely to recur and no longer cast \ndoubt on his reliability and trustworthiness.   \n \n \nThe 2006 offenses of aggravated assault, unlawful possession of a weapon, \ncriminal trespass, and public intoxication, even though they arose from one incident are \nserious.  The offenses were committed three years ago and Applicant has not been \ninvolved in any further criminal offenses.  Psychological evaluations of Applicant done \ncontemporaneously with the 2006 offense show that his actions were not characteristic \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor him and are not likely to recur.  There were outside pressures.  His divorce and the \nanxiety caused by continued ridicule and torment at work, led to the offenses.  There is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation.  Applicant removed himself from those pressures \nby changing his shift at work so he does not encounter his tormentor.  He has seen \nmental health professionals who have provided him with coping skills to understand his \ndivorce.  He completed all of his court ordered probation and community service.  He \ncontinues to work hard and is productive at work.  He leads a quiet live with is family.  \nApplicant established he is successfully rehabilitated by his quiet life style, the passage \nof time, and his ability to understand and manage the stresses in his life.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \n32(b), and 32(d) all apply.  Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security \nconcerns alleged under Guideline J. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that three of the four \noffenses happened over 26 years ago and are not likely to recur.  I considered one \nalleged offense was not established.  I considered Applicant mitigated the remaining \noffense by establishing that the offense was out of character for him, and there was \nsuccessful rehabilitation by completion of his pre-trial diversion and community service.  \nSufficient time has passed to show the actions are not likely to recur.  Overall, on \nbalance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant used the Egyptian passport to travel to Egypt in June 1999 and November 2005.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to Guideline E.  That finding is not at issue here.\n1\n2\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 9, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January\n31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Government met its burden of\nproof; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant was born in Egypt and\nmoved to the United States in 1984 to pursue higher education.  He is married to a Canadian citizen,\nand he became a naturalized United States citizen in 1999.  Applicant admitted certain SOR factual\nallegations (which the Judge incorporated in his decision as findings of fact).  These include the fact\nthat Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Egypt and the United States and was issued an\nEgyptian passport in June 1999 (which was renewed in 2005) after he received a United States\npassport in May 1999.  Applicant used the Egyptian passport to travel to Egypt in June 1999 and\nNovember 2005.  Applicant maintains his Egyptian citizenship and passport because he owns a\ncondominium in Egypt worth $170,000 and maintains a bank account there with a balance of\napproximately $100,000.  Applicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of Egypt.\nIn his Conclusions section, regarding Guideline C, the Judge stated that while Applicant did\ncut a small piece off of his Egyptian passport, he could not be considered to have ultimately revoked,\ndestroyed, or invalidated his foreign passport.  Since Applicant was unwilling to renounce his\nEgyptian citizenship, and he never notified the Egyptian authorities to revoke his passport, there is\nnothing to prevent him from immediately reapplying and getting a new Egyptian passport.  The\nJudge further concluded that no mitigating condition under Guideline C applied to the case and the\ndisqualifying evidence substantially outweighs the mitigating evidence.  Regarding Guideline B, the\nJudge concluded that Applicant was particularly close to his mother, who lives in Egypt, and also\nconcluded that when compared to his limited resources in the United States, Applicant\u2019s Egyptian\nholdings, which include a condominium valued at $170,000 and a bank account worth $100,000,\nmust be considered substantial and could subject Applicant to heightened risk of foreign influence\nor exploitation, resulting in a formal finding against Applicant under Guideline B.\n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant repeats some of his testimony from the hearing.   He also\n1\npresents new facts which are not part of the record below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n\nApplicant admitted all but one of the SOR allegations under Guideline C and all of the allegations under\n2\nGuideline B.\nApplicant cites two ICSR decisions which he contends support his position.  One, ISCR Case No. 99-0062\n3\n(Sep. 15, 1999), is a Hearing Office decision and therefore would not be binding precedent for the Board.  The other,\n98-0476 (Dec. 14, 1999), is a Board decision which discusses Foreign Preference, but it denies the applicant a clearance.\n3\nApplicant maintains that the government did not meet its burden of proof in his case.\nAlthough Applicant admitted factual allegations against him in the SOR,  he argues that the\n2\ngovernment was required to prove the disqualifying conditions related to those factual allegations\nand that its failure to do so constitutes error.  Applicant\u2019s argument is without merit.  Under the\nDirective, once the facts alleged in the SOR had been established, in this case by Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate those facts; and\nApplicant had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions with regard to the Guideline C and\nGuideline B allegations against him.  Among the conclusions that Applicant points to under\nGuideline C are those concerning the security significance of Applicant\u2019s possession and use of an\nEgyptian passport and under Guideline B those concerning the presence of his mother and sister in\nEgypt.  \nWith regard to Guideline C, Applicant argues that he should be able to hold and use an\nEgyptian passport purely for travel convenience as long as he does not otherwise demonstrate a\npreference for Egypt over the United States.   Moreover, Applicant argues that he defaced the\n3\npassport and sent copies of it to Department Counsel shortly after the hearing (during the time that\nthe Judge left the record open for further submissions).  \nIn deciding that Applicant\u2019s continued possession of his Egyptian passport was of security\nsignificance and was unmitigated, the Judge noted that Applicant never notified the Egyptian\nauthorities to revoke his passport.  To the extent the Judge concluded that Applicant was required\nto notify Egyptian authorities and get them to revoke his passport in order to mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns, such a conclusion was error.  The implementation of the current\nAdjudicative Guidelines on September 1, 2006 superceded the August 16, 2000 Memorandum of\nthe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence and\nits requirement that Applicants formally surrender a foreign passport to the issuing authority.\nHowever, after a review of the totality of the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline C, the Board\nconcludes that any error regarding the requirement of passport surrender is rendered harmless by the\nfact that other portions of the Judge\u2019s analysis, which emphasize Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to\nrenounce his Egyptian citizenship and his failure to ultimately revoke, destroy, or invalidate his\nEgyptian passport, are sufficient to sustain the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse clearance decision under\nGuideline C.        \n   \n\n4\nApplicant also argues that his dual citizenship and the presence of his mother and sister in\nEgypt should not be considered to be of security concern.  He notes the cooperative relationship\nbetween Egypt and the United States and maintains that Egypt has no need to gather information due\nto the nature of that relationship.  However, he states that renunciation of his Egyptian citizenship\nwould require him to file a court action in Egypt which would eventually reach the office of the\nPresident of Egypt.  Applicant states that action would be \u201crisky\u201d for him because \u201c[i]t exposes the\napplicant to the Egyptian government and identifies him as someone with foreign allegiance and\npossibly information.\u201d  He also states that it would also put his family in Egypt in jeopardy.  The\nrecord supports the Judge\u2019s conclusions on those matters, particularly in light of Applicant\u2019s\ncomments.  Cf. ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007).      \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guideline C and Guideline B is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance decision is AFFIRMED\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Applicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Government met its burden of proof; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant was born in Egypt and moved to the United States in 1984 to pursue higher education. He is married to a Canadian citizen, and he became a naturalized United States citizen in 1999. Applicant admitted certain SOR factual allegations (which the Judge incorporated in his decision as findings of fact).

On August 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C, B,\nand E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on September 4, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 18, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 13, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 19, 2007, in Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received and\nadmitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through H.\n\n2\nExhibits G and H, after objection, were not admitted. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 10, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record\nopen until January 4, 2008, to submit an additional document.  On January 2, 2008, he\nsubmitted Exhibit I, without objection, and the record closed on that date. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Egypt. The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 4. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 27, 2007, Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations in the SOR with the exception of 1.c. and 3.a. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 48 years old and was born in Egypt in 1959. He moved to the United\nStates in 1984 to pursue a higher education. He became a naturalized United States\ncitizen in 1999. Applicant received two Masters degrees from United States universities.\nHe is married to a Canadian citizen, and he has no children. \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his potential future employment in the defense sector.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\n1.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Egypt and\nthe United States. The basis of this allegation includes the following subparagraphs 1.b.\nthrouugh 1.e., under Guideline C.\n1.b. Applicant applied for and was issued an Egyptian passport in June 1999,\nand he renewed it in October 2005, even though he had become a United States citizen\nin April 1999, and received a United States passport in May 1999. Applicant testified\nthat he kept and renewed his Egyptian passport to use it as an identification form. He\nalso uses it to enter Egypt since he believes it is safer than using any other passport.\n1.c. When Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on July 18,\n2006, he possessed a valid Egyptian passport that is not scheduled to expire until 2012,\n\n3\nand he indicated that he was unwilling to relinquish this passport. At the hearing\nApplicant testified that he is willing to relinquish this passport to the proper Egyptian\nauthorities, but he is not willing to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. The record was\nheld open to allow Applicant to return his Egyptian passport to Egyptian authorities.\nRather than do that, he did submit a post hearing document (Exhibit I) showing a copy\nof his Egyptian passport with one corner cut off. He indicated in an accompanying letter\nthat he did not submit it to the Egyptian authorities, as he still hopes to be able to use it\nas an Egyptian identification. \n1.d. Applicant maintains his Egyptian citizenship and passport because he\nmaintains a condominium and bank account in Egypt, as discussed in 2.b., and 2.c.,\nbelow. At the hearing, Applicant conceded that he could not own the condominium or\nthe bank account in Egypt if he were not an Egyptian citizen. Currently his mother and\naunt live in the condominium, and when he visits Egypt, Applicant stays there as well.\n1.e.  Applicant used his Egyptian passport rather than his United States passport\nto enter and exit Egypt in June 1999 and November 2005. When he entered Egypt in\n1999 and 2005, he only identified himself as an Egyptian citizen, not as a dual citizen or\nUnited States citizen. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\n2.a. Applicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of Egypt.  His\nmother, who is 75,  has been retired from the Egyptian Department of Welfare since\n1992, and she now receives a pension form the Egyptian Government. His sister had\nbeen a school teacher, but she is not currently working. He speaks to his mother by\ntelephone, once a week, and to his sister once every two or three months.  Applicant\nalso has four aunts who live in Egypt. None of them have worked for the Egyptian\nGovernment.  He testified that he has no relatives other than his wife who live in the\nUnited States.\n2.b. Applicant owns a condominium in Egypt worth approximately $170,000. He\ninherited that from his father.\n2.c. Applicant maintains a bank account in Egypt with a balance of the equivalent\nof approximately $100,000. He also inherited the money from his father.\n2.d. Applicant traveled to Egypt in June 1999 and November 2005. Applicant\nintends to visit Egypt again in the not too distant future, but he does not have any set\nplans at this time. He did testify that he wants to see his mother before she dies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n3.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance application (SCA) on October 27,\n2005. Question #17 asked, \u201cDo you have any foreign property, business connections or\nfinancial interests?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. He should have identified\nhis condominium and bank account in Egypt, as set forth in 2.b. and 2.c., above. At the\n\n4\nhearing, Applicant testified that the condominium and the money were not placed in his\nname until after he completed the SCA, so at the time he executed the SCA, his answer\nthat he did not own any property or other financial interests in another country were\ncorrect. He also stated that he believed the question was asking about a business\ninterest in another country, which Applicant did not have. \nIn response to questioning, Applicant indicated that he owns no property in the\nUnited States, and he has approximately $20,000 in U.S. assets.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Egypt. The Arab\nRepublic of Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. It is a republic with a\ndeveloping economy and a strong executive. The United States and Egypt enjoy a\nstrong and friendly relationship based on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace\nand stability, strengthening trade relations, and promoting regional security. However,\ndespite Egypt\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists and it zero tolerance policy on\nextremism, the threat of terrorism in Egypt remains high and transnational and local\nterrorist groups continue to pose a threat to Egypt, and these terrorist groups conduct\nintelligence activities. Finally, Egypt\u2019s human rights record is poor and serious abuses\ncontinue in many areas. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s retention of his Egyptian  passport raises foreign preference\nconcerns. Disqualifying condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the privilege of foreign\ncitizenship applies because (1) Applicant retained his Egyptian passport, which he used\non the two occasions to enter and exit Egypt, after he became a United States citizen.\nDC (e) also apples as Applicant used his Egyptian citizenship to protect his ownership\nrights to the condominium and the bank account in Egypt, which he could not have\nowned if he were not an Egyptian citizen.  \nWhile Applicant did cut a small piece off of his Egyptian passport, I find that he\ncan not be considered to have ultimately revoked, destroyed, or invalidated his foreign\npassport. Since he was unwilling to renounce his Egyptian citizenship, and he never\nnotified the Egyptian authorities to revoke his passport, there is nothing to prevent him\nfrom immediately reapplying and getting a new Egyptian passport.  Therefore, I find that\nno mitigating condition (MC) under this guideline applies to this case. After considering\nall of the evidence of record on Guideline C, I conclude that the disqualifying evidence\nsubstantially outweighs the mitigating evidence. \n\n6\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens\nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial\nreason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence). Applicant\u2019s relatives are citizens of Egypt, which could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information\nbecause it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to\npresent evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of\npersuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC 7. (a) applies,\ncontact with foreign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign\ncountry, if that contact creates heightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or\ncoercion. Applicant is particularly close to his mother, whom he speaks to every week. \nDC (e) also applies because of Applicant\u2019s ownership of a condominium in Egypt valued\nat $170,000, and his Egyptian bank account worth $100,000. Based on his limited\nresources in the United States, his Egyptian holdings must be considered substantial\nand could subject Applicant to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \nI have determined that based on his extremely close relationship with his mother\nand his substantial financial holdings in Egypt that under Guideline B, no MC applies in\nthis case.\n \n        Accordingly, I find Guideline B against Applicant.\n\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant did not\nidentify his ownership of the condominium or the bank account in Egypt when he\ncompleted the SCA in October 2005. However, I find that Applicant\u2019s contention that at\nthe time he completed the SCA neither of these items was legally owned by him.\nTherefore Applicant response was correct, and Applicant did not intend to mislead the\nGovernment.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant.\nI therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove, regarding Applicant\u2019s Egyptian citizenship and passport, his mother in Egypt and\nhis significant assets in Egypt, I also find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn October 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 2, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 4, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nApril 10, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 10, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and six exhibits.  The transcript\nAugust 11, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on April 18 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her disputed debts with two of her listed creditors and a\nresponse from one of the creditors whose debt she has disputed. For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted 20 days to supplement the record.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented dispute correspondence\nand information.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated six delinquent\ndebts exceeding $29,000.00 and (b) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in March\n1998 and was discharged in bankruptcy in July 1998.  The SOR does not detail her\ncreditor and asset schedules. \nFor her answer, Applicant admitted her bankruptcy petition and discharge, but\ndenied the alleged debts, with explanations.  She claimed to be an honest hardworking\nAmerican, who tries to be a good example and live by the law (e.g., pays her fair share\nof taxes, never been arrested ro committed a crime, save for minor traffic violations, and\nalways tries to help people and organizations in her community when able to).

Later in the same year, she was involved in an auto accident and incurred injuries\nthat prevented her from working (R.T., at 108-09).  While out of work with a disability,\nshe settled with both her own workman\u2019s compensation carrier and the carrier of the\nthird party responsible for her accident (see ex. M; R.T., at 112-15).  Under the terms of\nher overall settlement with the two carriers, she became entitled to payment of her\nmedical expenses and disability payments (see ex. M).  When workman\u2019s compensation\n\n3\nceased paying her medical charges, she was forced to invade her savings to satisfy her\ndebts.  Once she exhausted her savings, she turned to selling off her personal assets to\ncover her ongoing medical bills.  \nBased on the advice she received from a bankruptcy lawyer, Applicant petitioned\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in March 1998 (R.T., at 112-14).  Her schedule of\ncreditors included both medical and consumer-related debts, and exceeded $50,000.00\n(see ex. 3; R.T., at 129).  She reaffirmed her car loan, though, and continued making\npayments on this loan following her bankruptcy discharge in July 1998 (see ex. 3).  \nFor some period following her bankruptcy discharge, Applicant was able to\nrestore her credit.  For several years (i.e., between 1998 and 2002), she was able to\nmaintain current status with her creditors.  This all changed for Applicant in 2002\nfollowing her layoff, her battles with cancer (see exs. H and M), and her husband\u2019s\ninability to work for medical reasons.  During her extended layoff, she relied on her\ncredit protection insurance to defer her monthly payment obligations on her creditor 1.b\naccount.  \nApplicant disputes the five debts listed in the SOR.  One of the debts (creditor\n1.c) represents a credit card debt she believes to belong to her sister who assumed her\nidentity (see exs. A and C through G; R.T., at 88-92).  This debt reflects AF base\ncharges that were incurred on a base facility in which her sister had access to, but\nApplicant did not (see ex. G; R.T., at 139-45).  Applicant has written to the credit\nreporting agencies about these debts, and her dispute is reflected in her most recent\ncredit report (see exs. A and B). \nAnother listed debt (creditor 1.b) involves a credit card debt that Applicant\nopened in 1998.  She claims she had credit card protection that protected her during\nperiods of medically-related work disruptions and disputes the entire debt (see exs. A, H\nand K; R.T., at 67-69). She had been fully employed and paying her bills when she\nsuffered a layoff in November 2001.  Several months following her layoff and initiation of\ncancer treatments (in February 2002), she filed for credit protection to cover the\nprevious three months of work disruption and any continuing disruptions (R.T., at 75-\n76).  It is not clear how many months (if any) her credit protection insurance covered her\nmonthly payments.  \nApplicant does provide documentation of her creditor 1.b dispute (see ex. this\ndispute that she provided after the hearing (see exs. A and F).  Her documentation does\nnot contain any details of her specific disputes with the creditors.  Her post-hearing\ndocumentation addresses her credit protection claims, but reflects much more limited\ncredit protection (up to 24 months) available (see ex. K).  The further documentation\ndoes not shed any further light on Applicant\u2019s claims that the creditor suspended its\nmedical protection coverage long before the end of her cancer treatment.  Applicant\npreviously shredded the credit protection agreement she relies on, and must rely,\naccordingly, on coverage summaries (ex. K; R.T., at 67-71).  While not fully verifiable,\n\n4\nher claims reflect sincerity and candor and absent any evidence from the creditor to\nchallenge her claims are entitled to acceptance.  \nApplicant claims credit card fraud with the two smaller listed creditors (creditors\n1.d and 1.e).  She documents her successful efforts to obtain the removal of these two\ntwo  smaller debts listed in the SOR (see exs. A and I).  Applicant assures she paid\nthese debts and has not had accounts with either of these creditors in years (R.T.,at 93-\n108).  With their removal from her credit report, these debts are resolved.\nApplicant also disputes the creditor 1.a debt listed in the SOR.  This debt\nrepresents a $4,000.00 deficiency on a repossessed vehicle in 2002 (see exs. 4 through\n6, A, H, J and O; R.T., at 41-63).  Applicant and her husband had been making regular\npayments on a Ford Explorer they purchased the previous year.  When Applicant was\ndiagnosed with skin cancer, her husband took off a good deal of time from work to help\nout at home with the kids.  He soon lost his job, and missed some car payments (R.T.,\nat 41).  With her husband out of work and Applicant\u2019s ongoing cancer treatments, their\nfinances at the time were very limited (see exs. H and M).  Applicant claims she and her\nhusband were able to work out a temporary payment agreement with the seller until\nthey could get back on their feet that permitted them to make partial payments for a\ncouple of months (R.T., at 57-58).\nBy Applicant\u2019s account, creditor 1.a  reneged on its agreement with Applicant and\nher husband and repossessed the Explorer vehicle before they could ever develop their\nreduced payments.  Breach of their agreement with the seller is the gravamen of their\ndispute with creditor 1.a.  Applicant assures she never received a sale notice for the\nrepossessed vehicle and disputes creditor 1.a\u2019s claimed deficiency on both breach and\nnotice grounds.  She documents correspondence covering a class action lawsuit and\ninitiated complaints with the better business bureau in her community (see ex. A) that\nshe joined against this creditor over notice issues.  There has been no documented\ndisposition of this class action.  \nNotwithstanding her continuing dispute with creditor 1.b over credit protection\ndefaults in 2004 while she was receiving cancer treatment, she acknowledges some of\nthe debt and is willing to pay on the debt, were the creditor to offer her a reasonable\npayment plan (R.T., at 84-85).  With the class action still pending, she advised the credit\nreporting agencies that the creditor could not pursue collection of the debt (see ex. A;\nR.T., at 46-47).  Unable to elicit any kind of supportive response from the creditor about\npending class action litigation, the credit reporting agency just deleted the debt from her\ncredit report in December 2007 (see ex. A; R.T., at 47-56).  To date, though, creditor 1.b\nhas not been willing to negotiate any kind of payment terms, and has continued to\naccrue interest (compounded) on the debt.  \nApplicant assures she is current with her other creditors.  Her credit report\nprovides general corroboration for her claims (see ex. B).  She couldn\u2019t recall any past\ndue accounts at the present (R.T., at 117). \n\n5\nTo provide more liquidity for her family, she has put her home up for sale and\nseeks a little less than $20,000.00 over the home\u2019s purchase price (R.T., at130-31).\nShe has less than $1,200.00 in stock savings (down from the $2,000.00 she used to\nhave in her account) and $47,514.00 in medical bills (R.T., at 132).  She is responsible\nfor about $7,000.00 in co-pays on these bills (R.T., at 132).  Applicant has two cars (a\n1995 Blazer and a 2005 truck) that are paid off.  Applicant is essentially providing most\nof the financial support for her family.  Her husband has not returned to work for some\ntime (R.T., at 117), and between the two of them, they estimate a monthly remainder of\n$250.00, sometimes less  (R.T., at 136).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b618.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\n\n6\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a defense contractor employee with some history of recurrent debt\nissues.  Medically-related issues prompted her to seek and perfect Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief in 1998, and she has accrued several listed delinquent debts (five in\nall) since 2002 that she seriously disputes on various grounds.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts that prompted her to seek Chapter 7 protection in\n1998 and her recurrent problems with her finances since 2002 warrant the application\nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations:\nDC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to income shortages attributable to\nrecurrent medical-related issues involving both herself and her husband that produced\nextended periods of disability and lay-offs for both spouses.  Applicant disputes each of\nthe debts listed and documents her disputes with the credit reporting agencies.  Since\nreceiving the SOR, she has initiated additional efforts to bring to closure the five listed\ndebts she claims to represent erroneous delinquencies in her credit reports. \n\n7\nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with her\nmedical disabilities and work layoffs, the limited resources that have been available to\nher to address her old debts when during financial crises, and her documented\nresponsible efforts to resolve her acknowledged debts, through the dispute process\nafforded her by the credit reporting agencies, Applicant may rely on MC 20 (b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial considerations.  With her\nincreased flow of steady income and better management of her finances, Applicant has\nslowly begun to regain control of her finances.  \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her credible proofs of\ngood-faith disputes with all five of the listed creditors in the SOR.  Age of the debts at\nissue is covered by two of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC\n20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability, while not dispositive.\nMC (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some applicability.  MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d has applicability as well relative to\nthe listed creditors she disputes. \nApplicant seriously disputes each of the listed debts for different reasons: some\nover prior payment claims (creditors 1.d and 1.e), one over stolen identity (creditor 1.c),\none over failure to honor her credit card\u2019s credit protection when there is proof of a\nmedical disability (creditor 1.b), and one over the lack of notice of any intended resale of\nthe vehicle (creditor 1.a).  For each of these accounts, regardless of whether they may\nreflect otherwise valid debts, they may no longer be enforceable under the State\u2019s\napplicable statute of limitations for written contracts.  \nThe state statute of limitations in Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written\ncontract is four years (see 16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code) and\nclaims not otherwise provided for (see 16.051 of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code). \nAll of Applicant\u2019s disputed debts are aged and appear to be covered by the State\u2019s four-\nyear time bar.  \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by our\nAppeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.\nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.  They have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020,\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  Weight, if any, to be assigned to potentially applicable\n\n8\nstatutes of limitations under the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the\ncircumstances surrounding the existing debts.  Viewed in this whole person light, the\ncontrolling state statute of limitation for written contracts is entitled to be accorded\nconsiderable mitigation weight in evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk. \n                                                        \nWhile the counseling advice from her bankruptcy attorney in 1998 is too aged to\nhave any material bearing on resolution of her most recent debts, Applicant is to be\ncredited with earnestly looking for sources of financial advice with the resources\navailable to her and taking productive advantage of the public advice she received in\naddressing her debts.  She may take limited advantage MC 20\u00a9), \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Based on her initiated efforts to\ndate, prospects for her gaining important insights in handling her finances in the future\nappear to be promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are present, too, in\nfinancial cases (as here).  See Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b618.\nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has shown considerable resilience in\nmeeting the challenges posed by medical disabilities and layoffs (both herself and her\nhusband), and demonstrated a remarkable turn around in her efforts to rebuild her credit\nstatus.  She has disputed the debts she questions and acknowledged those that hers.\nOverall, she is credited with producing some very tangible improvements in her\nmanaging of her finances.  \nTaking into account all of the facts and extenuating circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, her documented steps taken to resolve her disputed\ndebts, Applicant mitigates security concerns related to her disputed debts. Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.f of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

The minor, inadvertent security \nviolations at issue here were a result of Applicant\u2019s workload, the lax security culture \nthat his employer previously fostered, and sharing office space with others who, at \ntimes, willingly violated the security rules knowing Applicant would be held responsible. \nNone of the violations resulted in the compromise of classified information, and the last \nsecurity incident occurred over three years ago.

He submitted a security \nclearance application (SCA) in September 2006. He was subsequently interviewed by \nand provided an affidavit to a government investigator as part of his background \ninvestigation in June 2008.

The basis for this decision is set forth in a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), which alleges the security concern of Guideline K \n(Handling Protected Information).1 Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on \nFebruary 4, 2010.2 He admitted all the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing to \ncontest the adverse determination. \n \n \nOver a year later, on May 12, 2011, the Government filed its ready-to-proceed.

His Air Force career was primarily in the field of command, control, \ncommunications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance or, as it is \ncommonly referred to nowadays, C4ISR. He was involved with classified projects and \nwas granted a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented \nInformation (TS/SCI).6 While a member of the U.S. Air Force, Applicant never had a \nsecurity violation, nor mishandled classified information.7 Applicant\u2019s earliest \nperformance reports to his last one in the Air Force speak to his professionalism, work \nethic, and exceptional judgment.8 During the Bosnian conflict and while assigned to \nNATO, Applicant developed and implemented security procedures that protected \nsensitive U.S. technology, while simultaneously ensuring that the C4ISR assets \ndisplayed and recorded critical mission data.9  \n \n \n \nAfter retiring from the Air Force in 1999, Applicant was hired by a NATO Agency \n(Agency). This Agency generally provides an initial three-year employment contract to \nindividuals they hire and, if the Agency is happy with the individual\u2019s work performance, \na three-year extension. Most employees do not have their employment contracts \nrenewed at the end of the six-year period. However, a select few, 20 to 25 percent of \nthose hired, whose performance is outstanding, are retained. In September 2010, \nApplicant was offered and accepted a permanent position with the Agency.10 He \ncurrently serves as the Agency\u2019s head portfolio manager for a multi-million dollar a year \ncontract, which provides NATO forces, including those deployed to Afghanistan, with \nmuch needed capabilities.11 \n \n \nFrom about 1999 to about April 2008, Applicant served as both a program \nmanager and an executive officer for the Agency. These two responsibilities kept \nApplicant extremely busy. It involved a lot of paperwork, with other Agency employees \ncoming in and out of Applicant\u2019s office, and leaving all sorts of papers on his desk. The \nAgency has since bifurcated these demanding positions and hired two different \nindividuals to handle them. During this time, Applicant also shared an office with two \nother Agency employees. These two other employees reflected the Agency\u2019s culture at \nthe time when it came to the handling and safeguarding of classified information. In \nshort, employees at the Agency had become lax in their security responsibilities. The \n \n6 Tr. at 131-133, 165-166, 206-208.

Also, the fact \nthat the Agency was physically located within a well-guarded restricted area where only \nauthorized individuals were allowed to enter contributed to this lax attitude. It is during \nthis period that the bulk of the security violations at issue occurred.12  \n \n \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s security violations took place between 1999 and \n2005. (SOR, \u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d). All were a result of negligence. Most were either actually \ncommitted by the two employees Applicant shared an office with or heavily contributed \nto by their actions or those of other Agency employees. Applicant, as the highest \nranking individual in the shared office, always took responsibility for the violations. After \none of the earlier incidents, Applicant spoke to the two employees about being more \ncareful in securing classified material; however, he was not their supervisor. Following \nthis conversation, one of the officemates improved her security awareness, while the \nother, who understood that Applicant would always be held responsible for the \nviolations occurring in the shared workspace, did not change.13 The new security \nmanager for the Agency described this other employee as one of the worst offenders in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information within the Agency.14  \n \nAll the security violations that occurred between 1999 and 2005 involved NATO \nRestricted (NR) documents, except for a May 2004 incident involving NATO \nConfidential materials.15 (SOR, \u00b6 1.b). The Agency could not determine whether it was \nactually Applicant or one of the two officemates who committed the May 2004 \nviolation.16 \n \n \nThe last three security violations took place between 2006 and 2008. (SOR, \u00b6 1.e \n\u2013 1.g). The first of these in July 2006 occurred when Applicant returned from a trip and a \nsecretary left a large number of documents on his desk for his review. One of these \ndocuments contained NR information, but did not have the required cover sheet alerting \nthe reader that it was a NR document. Applicant quickly reviewed the documents, \nremoved those classified documents that had the required coversheet, and threw out \n \n12 Tr. at 33-34, 47-50, 71-95, 105-106, 127-128, 150, 153-160, 174-176, 208-209.

This \ngenerally causes problems for NATO employees with a U.S. background, because the U.S. does not \nhave a true equivalent to NR. NATO employees with a U.S. background usually overlook that NR is a \nclassification level requiring that the user handle and safeguard the information as they would other \nclassified material.

The Agency\u2019s security staff \nuncovered the violation and cited Applicant.17 The last two security violations, in \nOctober 2006 and February 2008, involved NATO Secret (NS) material. In both \ninstances Applicant was distracted by work, either a late business call or a meeting, and \ndid not realize that the safe he shared with three other Agency employees had not been \nproperly secured by one of the other employees. The other Agency employee had \nclosed the safe, but forgotten to take the last step of spinning the dial. These violations \nwere caught by the Agency\u2019s security staff and, as Applicant was the last to leave the \noffice, he was held responsible for these violations.18  \n \nShortly after the February 2008 incident, Applicant received a written warning \nfrom the Agency\u2019s Deputy General Manager. This served as a wakeup call to Applicant. \nPrior to this written warning, Applicant had only received, at most, a mild rebuke from a \nsecurity officer or his supervisor regarding his past violations. Applicant was also placed \non a one-year probationary period and the Security Manager told his staff to pay special \nattention to Applicant. The security staff did not detect any security violations by \nApplicant during the one-year probationary period, nor since the last incident in \nFebruary 2008.19  \n \nApplicant has taken a number of steps to ensure that such violations do not \noccur again. He diligently follows a step-by-step checklist and then goes through the \nchecklist a second time, to include checking his trash every night before he leaves to \nmake sure that neither he, nor anyone else has mistakenly thrown away a classified \ndocument.20 Since the last incident in February 2008, Applicant occupies his own office \nand the Agency hired an individual to take over his executive officer duties, which allows \nApplicant to concentrate on his program manager responsibilities.21 The Security \nManager, who has over two decades of experience in the security field, testified that he \nhas no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s reliability and thinks \u201cit highly unlikely that he (Applicant) \nwould violate (security protocols) again.\u201d22 \n \nThe Agency\u2019s Financial Controller and Director of Resources (Director), who has \nbeen delegated the security responsibility for the entire Agency, testified that all of \nApplicant\u2019s security violations were determined by the Agency to be minor. None were \nintentional and none resulted in the compromise of classified information. According to \nthe Agency\u2019s own security rules, minor security violations, such as those at issue in this \n \n17 Tr. at 146-149, 194-195; GE 3 at 2. \n \n18 Tr. at 143-145, 195-206; GE 3 at 2-3. \n \n19 Tr. at 96-97, 110-111, 160-161, 188-191.

All of \nApplicant\u2019s security violations have been removed from his record at the Agency.23  \n \nThe Agency conducted its own investigation into Applicant\u2019s security violations. \nThe subsequent report notes the lax security culture existing at the time of these \nsecurity violations, and that a number of \u201cEnvironmental Issues\u201d contributed to the \nsecurity violations at issue, to include Applicant being located in a \u201cmulti-user office.\u201d \nThe report concludes that: \n \nSince the last incident . . . (Applicant) has occupied a single person office \nand has not been involved in any security violation. On the contrary, he \nhas been fully cooperative, compliant and wholly conscious of the \nindividual and collective part he plays in securing NATO\u2019s collective \nmaterial and personnel. At no time was he ever considered a case that \nneeded to be reported either to the National Security Authority or to the \nNATO Office of the Security, and this view was fully explained to the \nFederal Investigator during her visit to the Agency in June 2008. \n(Applicant) is currently seen as a well-respected and security conscious \nindividual, who has learned from his previous mistakes.24 \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, a retired one-star flag officer, who has \nsupervised Applicant over the last two years and gotten to know Applicant quite well, \nboth on a professional and social level, testified on his behalf. He testified that Applicant \nhas exceptional attention to detail and does not allow the fast pace of his work to \nundermine his security obligations. Based upon his observations, the supervisor opined \nthat Applicant is totally reliable, has a strong character, and is a pivotal member of his \nteam. As far as personnel security is concerned, the supervisor testified as to how \nApplicant serves as a role model to others25 \u2013 testimony that was corroborated by both \nthe Director and Security Manager.26  \n \nThe General Manager of Applicant\u2019s Agency, a retired three-star general, writes: \n\u201cI do not regard (Applicant) as a security risk in any way and would therefore urge that, \nin this case, his security clearance is left undisturbed and he be allowed to continued \nworking within (the Agency).\u201d27 The Agency\u2019s former General Manager, who has known \n \n23 Tr. at 50-51, 63-66.

I have never had any occasion to question his dedication to his \nwork, his loyalty or his integrity.\u201d28 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n28 AE B-4. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n32). \n                                                          \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information  \n \nThe Directive sets forth the security concern when an applicant fails to comply \nwith rules and regulations regarding the handling of protected information at AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201c[o]nce it is established that an applicant has \ncommitted a security violation, he has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he \nshould be entrusted with classified information.\u201d29 Accordingly, DOHA administrative \njudges must review any claims of reform and rehabilitation under a strict scrutiny \nstandard.30 Applicant\u2019s admissions in his affidavit (GE 3), interrogatory response (GE \n2), and Answer, establish the 14 security violations alleged in the SOR. Thus, the \u201cvery \nheavy burden\u201d standard enunciated by the Appeal Board applies.  \n \nAfter a review of the evidence, I concur with the position of the parties that the \nonly two disqualifying conditions established by the evidence are AG \u00b6 34(g)31 and \n(h).32 (Tr. at 224 and 2\n \n \nAn applicant may mitigate the Guideline K concerns by establishing one or more \nof the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 35. As noted above, Applicant in this case \nshoulders a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in attempting to establish any of these mitigating \nconditions and his ultimate burden of persuasion under the Directive. I have considered \nall the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35, and find that the following warrant \ndiscussion: \n \n \n29 ISCR Case No. 07-08119 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 8, 2010). See also, ISCR Case No. 04-12742 at \n3 (App. Bd. February 25, 2011); ISCR Case No. 06-21537 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. \n04-05802 at 5 (App. Bd. June 13, 2007) (Dissenting Opinion).  \n \n30 Id. at 4. \n \n31 Any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information. \n \n32 Negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by management. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last security violation occurred in February 2008, over three years \nago. Since then, he has not committed any further violations. However, time alone, \nwithout the occurrence of any further violations, would not be sufficient to carry the day \nin light of the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard that is applicable in this case. Applicant met \nthis burden. After his last security violation, Applicant was subjected to an intense one-\nyear probationary period during which time he was singled out for special observation \nby the Agency\u2019s security staff. Even though the staff was tasked with looking for any \nviolations committed by the Applicant, they did not find a single security violation during \nthat probationary period or afterwards.  \n \n \nFurther, and more importantly, Applicant has fundamentally changed the \nbehavior and attitude that led to the security violations in the first place. Notably, he \nscrupulously follows a checklist and goes over it twice, including checking his trash to \nmake sure that neither he, nor another employee has mistakenly thrown away classified \nmaterial. He has become a role model for other employees and is helping change the \nAgency\u2019s previously lax security culture. Clearly, the formal warning Applicant received \nin 2008 served as a much needed wakeup call, and he has since responded positively \nin discharging his security responsibilities.  \n \n \nIn addition, the circumstances under which the vast majority of these \nunintentional, minor violations took place have significantly changed since they \noccurred. Applicant is no longer tasked with two highly demanding jobs. The Agency \nhired two different individuals for the two time-consuming jobs Applicant held when \nthese violations occurred. More importantly, Applicant no longer shares an office with \nthe other employees who either committed the violations at issue or heavily contributed \nto their occurrence. The salutary result the Agency hoped would take effect when it \ninstituted these changes has been realized, as evidenced by the lack of security \nviolations over the past three plus years.  \n \n \nI had an opportunity to not only observe Applicant as he was questioned by \ncounsel, but also questioned him myself. I found him credible and straightforward. He \ntakes full responsibility for the violations at issue, is remorseful for his past conduct, and \nclearly now takes his security obligations seriously. I come to the same conclusion \nshared by all the witnesses in this case, including the Agency\u2019s General Manager, that \nApplicant\u2019s past history of security violations no longer casts doubt as to his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \ns.  \n                                                          \n \nThe above factors were favorably cited to by the Appeal Board in upholding a \ndecision for an applicant in ISCR Case No. 04-05802. (See ISCR Case No. 04-05802 at \n3). In that case, the applicant\u2019s last security violation occurred just a year before the \nfavorable hearing decision. Moreover, unlike the cited Appeal Board case, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer in this case did not wait until the eve of the hearing to make the necessary \nchanges to the environmental factors that heavily contributed to the violations at issue. \nThe salutary result the Agency expected from making these changes is clearly evident \nas there have been no further security violations since the changes took effect over \nthree years ago.33 Furthermore, this is not a case where Applicant failed to take \nresponsibility for the security violations at issue,34 the violations here did not result in \nthe actual compromise of classified information,35 and none of Applicant\u2019s violations \nwere due to intentional or willful security breaches36 \u2013 all factors that the Appeal Board \nhas previously cited in reversing favorable hearing level decision\n \n \nAccordingly, for all the reasons set forth above, I find that AG \u00b6 35 (a) and (b) \napply. Furthermore, I find that Applicant has met the very heavy burden standard and \nmitigated the Guideline K concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).37 I have considered and given due weight to all the \nfavorable and extenuating factors in this case. Applicant served this nation in the Air \nForce for over 20 years. He was granted access to and worked on some of the Air \nForce\u2019s most sensitive C4ISR technology and cutting-edge weapon systems. He never \n \n33 Compare with, ISCR Case No. 04-05802 at 6 (one of the reasons cited by the Dissent in its \nseparate opinion was the fact that the changes instituted by applicant\u2019s employer \u201coccurred, at most, two \nor three weeks prior to the hearing . . . (and) the lack of ability to evaluate whether the change has had \nthe salutary results applicant\u2019s superiors were hoping (to achieve)\u201d). \n \n34 ISCR Case No. 06-21537 at 4 (\u201cWhile there is record evidence that Applicant is now more \nreliable, there is also evidence that Applicant has not demonstrated a positive attitude by downplaying her \nresponsibility in the account\u2019s security errors.\u201d).  \n \n35 Id. at 5 (agency determination that actual compromise occurred undermined Administrative \nJudge\u2019s favorable decision).  \n \n36 ISCR Case No. 07-08119 at 5 (Appeal Board reverses due to evidence of an \u201congoing pattern \nof knowing and willful security violations, in contradistinction to Applicant\u2019s contention of merely \ninadvertent breaches.\u201d).  \n \n37 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nonce violated security regulations during that time or compromised the security of these \nprograms. The minor, inadvertent NATO security violations at issue here were a result \nof Applicant\u2019s prior workload, the lax security culture at the Agency, and sharing office \nspace with others who, at times, willingly violated the security rules knowing Applicant \nwould be held responsible. None of the violations resulted in the compromise of \nclassified information, and the last security incident was over three years ago. \nApplicant\u2019s Agency is confident in his ability to continue to safeguard classified \ninformation and asks that he be granted a security clearance. Based upon all the \nevidence presented, as well as having the opportunity to observe and question \nApplicant, I am confident that he will continue to properly handle protected information. \nThese whole-person factors, in conjunction with the favorable matters noted above, \nmitigate the Guideline K concern. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K (Handling Protected Information):    FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:       \n \n \n \n   For Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant continued access to classified information.

He has since received a salaried layoff notification notice that he will be laid off from his job in April 2008 (see ex. B).

While a citizen and resident of India, he obtained bachelors and masters degrees in his chosen field of engineering (R.T., at 39-40). In 1981, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. to pursue graduate studies in aeronautical engineering. He received two additional advanced degrees from a recognized U.S. university (R.T., at 39-43, 48). He applied for U.S. citizenship and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 44). He married in 1989 and divorced his wife in 1998 (see exs. 1 and 2), and remarried her in February 2008 (ex. A). He has one child from this marriage (now 13 years of age). He retains his dual citizenship with India (see ex. 1). Applicant\u2019s father (who worked for a federal government bank in India) is deceased. His mother is a citizen and resident of India. (R.T., at 61-62). He provides her monthly financial support that ranges from $100.00 to $50.00 (R.T., at 63-64). App",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHISTORY OF CASE\nOn December 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 26, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 4, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on April\n9, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 9, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.)\nJuly 24, 2008\n\n2\nwas received on April 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 10\ndocuments:  Background Note: India, U.S. Department of State (October 2007);\nConsular Information Sheet, U.S. Department of State (August 2007); Country Reports\non Human Rights Practices - 2006, India (March 2007); Country Reports on State\nSponsors of Terrorism, U.S. Department of State (November 2007); Country Reports on\nTerrorism, Chapter 2 - Country Reports, U.S. Department of State (April 2007); CRS\nReport to Congress: India-U.S. Relations (October 2007); Annual Report to Congress on\nForeign Economic Collection, 2005, National Center for Intelligence Executive (August\n2006); Press Release, Export Privileges Denied to Indian Corporation, U.S. Department\nof Commerce (December 2007). Press Release, Man to Plead Guilty in Plot to Export\nrestricted Technology to India, .U.S. Department of Commerce and Commerce (July\n2007), High Tech Firms/Executives Sentenced in Export Case,  U.S. Department of\nCommerce  (November 2005), Press Release, Chyron Corp Settles charges of\nUnlicensed Export to India, U.S. Department of Commerce (August 2004), Berkely\nNucleonics Corp Settles Charges of Unlicensed Exports (June 2004), Sentry Settles\nCharges of Unlicensed Exports, U.S. Department of Commerce (June 2004).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in India.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing India\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have a mother who is a citizen and\nresident of India, (b) provide financial support to his mother, (c) own an apartment in\nIndia, (d) have brothers and sisters who are citizens and residents of Indica, (e) have\nfiled petitions with U.S. immigration authorities in 1996 for the immigration of his brothers\nto the U.S., (f) to have a roommate (his former spouse) who has parents who are\ncitizens and residents of India, (g) have traveled to India in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002,\n2003, and 2004, and (h) have a son (born in 1995) who resided with his former spouse\u2019s\nparents from October 1995 to 2005, who he could see only through supervised visits\nbecause of his maternal grandparents\u2019 fear he would leave the country with his son.\nFor his answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations. He claimed he sponsored his mother\u2019s visits to the U.S., but still feels she\nis better staying in India to be with her children and grandchildren.  He explained that he\n\n3\nhas provided financial support to his mother since his father\u2019s death in 1991.  He claimed\nhis ex-wife\u2019s parents, while still citizens of India, are now permanent residents of the U.S.\nHe claimed his travels to India were all socially-related.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 52-year-old staff engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  He has since received a salaried layoff notification notice that he will\nbe laid off from his job in April 2008 (see ex. B). The layoff notice does not affect his\nentitlement to a hearing on his security clearance application (see Directive). The\nallegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and\nmaterial findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in India and attended high school there. While a\ncitizen and resident of India, he obtained bachelors and masters degrees in his chosen\nfield of engineering (R.T., at 39-40). \nIn 1981, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. to pursue graduate studies in\naeronautical engineering.  He received two additional advanced degrees from a\nrecognized U.S. university (R.T., at 39-43, 48).  He applied for U.S. citizenship and\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 44).  He married in 1989\nand divorced his wife in 1998 (see exs. 1 and 2), and remarried her in February 2008\n(ex. A).  He has one child from this marriage (now 13 years of age).  He retains his dual\ncitizenship with India (see ex. 1).  \nApplicant\u2019s father (who worked for a federal government bank in India) is\ndeceased.  His mother is a citizen and resident of India. (R.T., at 61-62).  He provides\nher monthly financial support that ranges from $100.00 to $50.00 (R.T., at 63-64).\nApplicant has five brothers and five sisters who are citizens and residents of India. (R.T.,\nat 73-74).  One of the brothers worked for a federal government bank before his\nretirement two years ago (R.T. at 74-75), and one of his sister\u2019s husbands was a\nresearch at a state-operated university in India (R.T., 79-80.  None of his other brothers\nand sisters have any experience in working for the Indian government (R.T., at 81).  \nApplicant owns an apartment unit in India.  He pays his youngest brother about\n$300.00 a year to manage the apartment unit (R.T., at 64-68).  His mother currently\nresides in this unit, which Applicant estimates to be worth about $10,000.00 (R.T., at 65-\n66).  None of Applicant\u2019s brothers or sisters have ever served in India\u2019s military.  His\nsisters all reside in India.  \nIn 1996, Applicant filed petitions with the U.S. Immigration Service for the\nimmigration of all five of his brothers to the U.S. (R.T., at 84-86).  While one of his\nbrothers has obtained his green card and will be immigrating to the U.S. to work, the\nother applications have likely lapsed for inactivity (R.T., at 86).\n\n4\nIn 2005, Applicant resumed living with his former spouse (W) at the time. They\nhave resided together continuously since 2005 with their son. W, too, is of Indian\ndescent and has parents who are citizens and former residents of India.  W\u2019s parents\nremain citizens of India, but have since taken up residence in the U.S. (R.T., at 88).\nApplicant and W have a son who was born to them in 1995.  Following his separation\nfrom W in 1995, W took their son to India to live with W\u2019s parents.  His son stayed with\nW\u2019s parents for the ensuing 10 plus years (i.e., October 1995 to 2005).  During this\nperiod, Applicant was allowed only supervised visits to see his son, because his son\u2019s\nmaternal grandparents were fearful that Applicant might attempt to leave India with his\nson (R.T., at 52-53). Since his return to the U.S. in 2005, his son has resided with\nApplicant and W in their U.S. residence (R.T., at 55-57)\nApplicant has traveled to India regularly since 1997.  He reports his trips to India\nin 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2007 to visit his parents and siblings (R.T., at 96-\n99).  His son accompanied him on his last trip to India to visit his mother and W\u2019s parents\n(R.T., at 99-100).  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has two sisters who reside in the U.S. and a third sister who\nstill resides in India.  W\u2019s father practiced privately as a physician in India; he never\nworked for the Indian government or military (R.T., at 90-91).  W\u2019s mother was a nurse at\none time, but is currently retired.  W\u2019s sister who resides in India is a homemaker; her\nhusband worked in the PRC for a year, but is currently looking for a job in India.\nApplicant maintains monthly contact with his mother and little contact with any of\nhis siblings (R.T., at 82-83).  W talks to her sisters weekly (R.T., at 94).  No government\nor military officials have ever tried to exert any pressure or influence over his immediate\nand extended family members (R.T., at 40-41).\nApplicant has no relatives of either his immediate family or extended family who\ncurrently work for the Indian government.  He does have numerous aunts and uncles,\nnephews and nieces who are citizens and residents of India who work exclusively in the\nprivate sectors (R.T., at 101-02).\nApplicant owns a home in the U.S., which he values at about $600,000.00 (R.T.,\nat 103).  He has a mortgage on the home of approximately $475,000.00 (R.T., at 104).\nIndia\u2019s country status\nConsidered the world\u2019s largest democratic republic, India is also a very diverse\ncountry, in population, geography and climate (see Consular Information Sheet, U.S.\nDepartment of State (August 2007));. India is the world\u2019s second most populous country\nand the world\u2019s seventh largest country in area (id.).\nIndia is a constitutional democracy, whose Constitution defines it as a \u2018sovereign,\nsocialist, secular democratic republic\u201d (see Background Note: India, U.S. Department of\nState (October 2007)).  It is a \u201cmultiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a\n\n5\nbicameral parliament\u201d and an historical reputation for respecting the rights of its citizens\n(see id.).  True, there have been reports of extrajudicial killings of persons in custody,\ndisappearances, torture and rape by police and security forces, who generally enjoy de\nfacto impunity (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, India  U.S.\nDepartment of State (March 2007)).  The basic problem stems from the lack of any clear\naccountability, which too often has resulted in cited human rights violations going\nunpunished (see id., at 1).  Police and security officials reportedly use torture and\nthreaten violence during interrogations to extort money and summarily punish prisoners\n(id. at 6).  \nSince gaining its independence from great Britain in 1947, India has been\ninvolved in wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, and has had to defend itself\nagainst a 1999 intrusion of Pakistani-backed forces into Indian-held territory that nearly\nturned into full-scale war ((see Background Note: India, supra, at 7 and CRS Report to\nCongress: India-U.S. Relations (October 2007)).  India survived a 1975 declaration of a\nstate of emergency that carried a suspension of many civil liberties (see Background\nNote: India, supra, at 3).  The country has experienced two assassinations of its leaders:\nPrime Minister Indira Ghandi in October 1984 and Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandi in May\n1991 (see id).  In recent years, India has been confronted with sporadic outbreaks of\nreligious riots (which resulted in numerous deaths and casualties, and violent attacks by\nseparatist groups in various parts of the country (id.).  \nBefore its demise in the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was India\u2019s principal and\nmost reliable trading partner, and an important source of economic and military\nassistance (see CRS Report to Congress: India-U.S. Relations, supra, at 9; Background\nNote: India, supra, at 8).  U.S. efforts to strengthen its ties with India have been\nhampered some by U.S. differences over India\u2019s nuclear weapons programs and the\npace of India\u2019s efforts to achieve long-planned economic reforms. \nImportant U.S. concerns have been raised, too, over reported cases involving\ngovernment sponsored entities and their illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of\nU.S. restricted dual use technology to India, including (1) high-tech testing equipment\nthat posed potential risks of diversion to a weapons of mass destruction program, (2)\ndual use equipment that can be used in military and civilian aircraft to extract engine\nvibration information, (3) equipment that can be used to manufacture material that\nimproves the accuracy of strategic ballistic missiles with nuclear capabilities, (4) an\nanimation system that can be diverted to weapons of mass destruction technology, (5)\nnuclear pulse generators to two Indian entities capable of mounting diversion to the\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or missiles, and (6) heat treating\ncontainers to an Indian entity capable of mounting diversion to the development of\nweapons of mass destruction or missiles (see Press Release, Export Privileges Denied\nto Indian Corporation, U.S. Department of Commerce (December 2007); Press Release,\nMan to Plead Guilty in Plot to Export Restricted Technology to India, U.S. Department of\nCommerce and Commerce (July 2007), High Tech Firms/Executives Sentenced in\nExport Case, U.S. Department of Commerce  (November 2005), Press Release, Chyron\n\n6\nCorp Settles charges of Unlicensed Export to India, U.S. Department of Commerce\n(August 2004)).\nRecommended travel restrictions do exist for U.S. citizens visiting India.  The\nState Department cautions U.S. citizens to avoid travel in general (with several noted\nexceptions) to the state of Jammu & Kashmir (see Consular Information Sheet).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism\u201d (see Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\n\n7\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nANALYSIS\nBorn and raised in India, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994.  He\nmarried his wife in 1989 and resumed living with her since their divorce in 1998\n(remarrying her in 2008).  Security concerns focus on Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings who\ncurrently reside in India, and his wife\u2019s family members who are also citizens of India who\nare either currently residing in the U.S. (her parents) or in India (her siblings). \nApplicant and his wife and family have deep roots in India, a country rich in history\nand socio/political traditions, constitutional government and institutional respect for human\nrights, intermixed with periodic reports of abuses by police and government authorities.\nDespite encouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships between India\nand the U.S. in recent years, there have been cited instances of illegal and damaging\nexport practices by Indian firms associated with the Indian government to create dual use\ndiversion risks.  \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s mother,\nsiblings and family members, as well as his wife and her family members residing in India,\nmight be subject to undue foreign influence by Indian government authorities to access\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant and his\nwife have family members who have Indian citizenship by birth and reside currently in\nIndia, they present potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition\n(DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence\nstatus of these family members in India pose some potential concerns for Applicant\nbecause of the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or\nclassified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. \n\n8\nBecause none of Applicant\u2019s family or W\u2019s family have any identified prior military\nor government service, no consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is\nwarranted.  To be sure, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of W\u2019s\nimmediate family residing in India have any political affiliations with the Indian\ngovernment or military.  Nor do they have any history to date of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nApplicant and his immediate family members (i.e., his mother, siblings and family\nmembers residing in India) have deep family roots in India.  The same is true with\nApplicant\u2019s wife, who also has immediate family members who are citizens and residents\nof India.  Their citizenship status and presence in India does not by itself create a\nheightened risk. Applicant/W\u2019s contacts with their family members are manageable risks,\nand clearly not of the magnitude that could make them subject to a heightened security\nrisk of pressure or compromise under Guideline B.  As a country, India has a lengthy\nhistory of constitutional government and generally recognized respect for human rights\nand the rule of law.  It continues to be a country with emerging strategic relationships with\nthe U.S., and a country that at present does not present a heightened risk under\nGuideline B. \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about India. \nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take into account the\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter.  As historically demonstrated, India has long been known to\nbe a country with democratic traditions, and generally recognized respect for human\nrights and the rule of law.  While the reports of illegal exporting of potential dual use\ntechnology has been matter of some security concern to the U.S., India\u2019s emergent status\nas a strategic partner of the U.S. in controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons is an\nimportant political development that serves to promote political solidarity, and reduce\nsecurity risks and concerns between the two nuclear powers.\nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or\nactivities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  is available\n\n9\nto Applicant.  Neither Applicant nor his immediate or extended family residing in India\npose heightened security risks that could subject them to potential pressures and\ninfluence from Indian government and military officials. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., is well demonstrated and enough\nunder these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his\nrelationships with his immediate, and extended family members, and his wife\u2019s family\nmembers.  MC 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d has some applicability, too, based on Applicant own infrequent contacts with\nhis ex-wife\u2019s family members residing in India. \nTwo other mitigating conditions have mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nMC 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value.  But there is really no\ndocumented record of Applicant\u2019s prior reporting of his contacts with members of his\nfamily and his wife\u2019s family, respectively, to warrant any more than minimal consideration\nat this time.  On the other hand, MC 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign\nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict\nand could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d has\na good deal more application to Applicant\u2019 situation.  His financial interests in India\n(primarily an apartment unit managed by his younger brother) are relatively small\ncompared to his U.S. interests.    \nWhole person assessment is available also to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflicts of interests with his Indian family members.  Most importantly, Applicant is not\naware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his, or his wife\u2019s, family\nmembers might be exposed to. So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential risk of coercion,\npressure, or influence being brought to bear on him, his ex-wife who is living with him, or\nany of their respective family members is minimal and mitigated. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with his\nwife and their respective family members residing in India, are sufficiently mitigated to\npermit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his familial relationships in India.  Favorable conclusions warrant\nwith respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\n\n10\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nFOR APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Aguirre, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated personal conduct and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 26, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines E (personal conduct) and J (criminal conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 15, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 7, 2011. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 2, 2011, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on March 24, 2011. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, \nApril 15, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. The record \nwas held open until April 8, 2011, for Applicant to submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted a document that was marked AE F and admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum forwarding Applicant\u2019s exhibit is marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 1, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer, or a predecessor contractor, since 2006. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1988 until he was \ndischarged in 1990. He has a General Educational Development (GED) high school \nequivalency certificate. He was married from 1989 to 1995. He has been married to his \ncurrent wife since 1997. He has five children, three from his first marriage, and two with \nhis current wife.1 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 1992, after he and his stepbrother burglarized a \nbusiness and stole about $10,000. He was charged with the felony offenses of burglary \nand theft. He pleaded guilty to burglary pursuant to a plea bargain. The plea bargain \nrequired him to testify against his stepbrother on the burglary and theft charges, and on \ncharges against the stepbrother for the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. Applicant \nreceived a deferred sentence and probation for six years, and he was ordered to pay \ncosts and $2,000 in restitution. The theft charge was dismissed. Applicant violated the \nterms of his probation on several occasions. The burglary charge was dismissed in \n1999 after Applicant completed his probation.2 \n \n \nApplicant was separated from his first wife in September 1992. He went to her \nhome and found her with a friend. His first wife and her friend reported to the police that \nApplicant became angry, pulled a pistol, pointed the pistol at them, pulled the slide \nback,3 and threatened to kill the friend. Applicant was later stopped in his car by the \npolice. Applicant told the police that he did not have a pistol, but that he used a knife \ncontained in a black leather sheath to simulate a pistol. There was no pistol found in his \nvehicle, but a knife in a black leather sheath was found in the glove compartment. \nApplicant was arrested for aggravated assault. He was never charged with the offense. \nApplicant testified that he did not have any weapon during the argument.4 I did not find \nhis testimony credible. I find that he did threaten his wife and her friend with a weapon. \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 22-25, 55-58; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 29-31, 38, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 10-13; AE B-E. \n \n3 In a semiautomatic pistol, a round is chambered by pulling the slide back, making the weapon \nready for firing. \n \n4 Tr. at 61-65, 84-85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 11, 12; AE D. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn April 1993, Applicant was charged with the felony offense of sexual assault by \naccountability. The complaint alleged that Applicant physically removed a 15-year-old \ngirl from a bedroom in which his stepbrother and another 15-year-old girl were engaged \nin, or about to engage in, sexual contact. Applicant then prevented the first girl from \nreentering the bedroom by blocking the doorway with his body. The charge against \nApplicant was dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain to testify against his stepbrother, as \ndiscussed above. Applicant admits that his stepbrother was dating a girl and she was in \nhis bedroom. He denies knowing her age, and he denies removing another girl from the \nbedroom and preventing her reentry.5 His testimony was not credible. \n \n \nIn November 1993, Applicant sold stolen antlers for $52. When questioned by the \npolice, Applicant initially stated that he found the antlers. He then admitted that he stole \nthe antlers, and that another man was involved. The police questioned the other man. \nThe man admitted that he stole the antlers, and then he and Applicant sold them. \nApplicant and the other man were both charged with the misdemeanor offense of petit \ntheft. Applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and court costs. At \nhis hearing, Applicant admitted that he sold the antlers, but he denied stealing them. He \nstated the other man was his cousin, and his cousin stole the antlers. He stated that he \nhad an idea that the antlers might be stolen when he sold them, but he was not certain.6 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 1999 and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI), first offense, and operation of a vehicle by a person with \nalcohol concentration of .10 or more. He pleaded guilty to the second charge. He was \nsentenced to 30 days in jail, all suspended; a $320 fine; he was ordered to attend \nalcohol classes; and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. The DUI charge \nwas dismissed.7 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for national security positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2006. He listed his 1999 DUI under the question that asked about alcohol \nand drug offenses. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 23a of the SF 86, which asked \u201cHave \nyou ever been charged with, or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under \nUniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d He stated that he misread the question and thought it \nonly asked for felony convictions. He stated that he did not know that he was charged \nwith felonies, and his burglary conviction was overturned.8 I do not find sufficient \nevidence for a determination that Applicant intentionally falsified the SF 86.   \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed about the 1992 burglary charge by an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in December 2006. He told the \ninvestigator that he had nothing to do with the burglary, and he was arrested as an \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 32-36, 61, 65-67, 79-82; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 11-13; AE D. \n \n6 Tr. at 31-32, 67-71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 7, 11. \n \n7 Tr. at 45-48, 75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 9. \n \n8 Tr. at 25-29, 41-42, 82-83; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n \naccomplice because his stepbrother used his truck and the stolen money was found in \nthe truck.9 I find that Applicant intentionally provided false information about the burglary \nto the investigator. \n \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement to an OPM investigator in March 2009. He \nwrote that he \u201cknew nothing about the burglary and had nothing to do with it.\u201d He wrote \nthat he was not guilty of the burglary, but agreed to plead guilty in order to receive a \ndeferred sentence. At his hearing, Applicant initially testified that the statement was \ntruthful; he later admitted that it was false.10 I find that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse information in the statement about his participation in the burglary.  \n \n \nIn the same statement, Applicant discussed his knowledge of the charges \nagainst his stepbrother for the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. He wrote that he \nknew his stepbrother had a teenage girlfriend, but he \u201cnever saw him victimize her and \ndid not know what they did behind closed doors.\u201d He also wrote that he \u201cnever blocked \nanyone in any room in [stepbrother\u2019s] residence.\u201d11 I do not find sufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that Applicant intentionally provided false information in the statement \nabout the sexual assault of the 15-year-old girl. \n \n \nApplicant provided another signed statement to an OPM investigator in May \n2009. He wrote that when he testified against his stepbrother, he knew his stepbrother \nhad a girlfriend, but he did not know how old she was. He also wrote that he \u201cdid not \nknow that [he] was charged with sexual assault and had no involvement or knowledge \nof a sexual assault involving a minor or anyone else.\u201d12 There is insufficient evidence for \na determination that Applicant intentionally provided false information in the statement \nabout the sexual assault of the 15-year-old girl. \n \n \nApplicant has received several awards from his employer for his excellent job \nperformance. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that he is trustworthy and a \u201chard-working good \nman.\u201d She also wrote a letter attesting to his honesty and dependability. She wrote that \nhe \u201chas learned from his bad choices and shows remorse for what he had done in the \npast.\u201d She believes he \u201chas paid his debt to society and has become a good citizen.\u201d \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been arrested, charged, or convicted of any \noffenses after 1999.13  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 76-79; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n10 Tr. at 36, 75-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11. \n \n11 Tr. at 36-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11. \n \n12 GE 12. \n \n13 Tr. at 75, 87-94; AE A. \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nIn 2006, and again in 2009, Applicant intentionally provided false information to \nOPM investigators about his participation in the 1992 burglary. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable.  \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified his 2006 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for \nApplicant. There is also insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant \nintentionally provided false information to OPM investigators about the sexual assault of \na 15-year-old girl in 1993. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are concluded for Applicant.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information to OPM investigators in 2006 \nand again in 2009. He was not completely candid during his testimony at the hearing. \nThere are no applicable mitigating conditions.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant was involved in a burglary and an aggravated assault in 1992, sexual \nassault by accountability and theft in 1993, and DUI in 1999. In 2006, and again in \n2009, Applicant knowingly and willfully made materially false statements to OPM \ninvestigators, as discussed above. It is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to \nknowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \nrepresentation in any matter within the executive branch of the Government of the \nUnited States. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of \nthe Government of the United States.1 A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious \noffense as it may be punished by imprisonment for up to five years. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n                                                          \n1See Egan, 484 U.S. at 527.  \n\n \n8 \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has not been arrested, charged, or convicted of any offenses since \n1999. He has a good job and a stable family life. Had Applicant been completely truthful \nthroughout the security process, a number of mitigating conditions would be applicable. \nHowever, he willfully violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in 2006 and again in March 2009. He \nwas not completely truthful at his hearing. No criminal conduct mitigating conditions are \napplicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n9 \n \nunder Guidelines E and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and his service to this \ncountry in the U.S. military. For the most part, Applicant has his life in order following a \nturbulent period of criminal activity in the 1990s. However, he failed to provide truthful \nresponses about his criminal activity during that period. It is fundamental to the security \nclearance process that applicants provide truthful and candid answers to all questions. \nApplicant chose not to.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns\narising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on October 6, 2008, Applicant denied 9 of the 11\nallegations noted in the SOR and declined a hearing on the record. Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), including 14 attached items,\ndated February 19, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on March 9, 2009. She timely\nsubmitted additional materials in response to the FORM. On May 15, 2009, the\nDirector, DOHA, forwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge for\nMay 27, 2009\n\n Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (SOR allegation 1.i).\n      1\n Appellant states she filed the bankruptcy because she \u201chad a \u2018housefire\u2019 and was trying desperately to\n      2\nsave my house from foreclosure.\u201d Response to FORM.

I was assigned the case on May 18, 2009. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her\nburden regarding the security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for\nthe same company for over 31 years. She presently serves as an engineering data\nsystems specialist. She earned a high school diploma and completed three years of\ncollege. She is married with three grown children.\nIn 1994, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection because she \u201chad a\nvery \u2018lazy\u2019 husband and in an effort to try to keep [her] house from being foreclosed on.\n. . . [She] eventually separated from [her] husband and had to leave the house\nanyway.\u201d  Her case was dismissed in or about September 1995. She again filed for\n1\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June 1999 in order to protect her house, but did\nnot include any bills or other obligations in her filing.  That case was dismissed in or\n2\nabout June 1999. In the late 1990s, Appellant failed to file her federal taxes because\nshe did not have the funds to pay her taxes-owed. She was unaware she could file,\nthen pay the amount owed later. She also felt that, after failing to file initially: \u201cI guess\nI\u2019d better not file this time because \u2018I ALREADY OWE THEM.\u2019\u201d  She ultimately married\n3\n\u201ca young man that was \u2018God\u2019 sent\u201d who helped her get her life back on track.  When\n4\nshe eventually ran into trouble with her federal taxes, he helped her sort out the\nproblem. Meanwhile, her health began to decline. She suffered from extreme\nhypertension by the end of the 1990s. Six years later, she was diagnosed with diabetes.\nA thyroid condition followed that diagnosis. Doctors had difficulty adjusting her\nmedications. With her husband\u2019s assistance, she ultimately filed federal income tax\nreturns for the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2003 together.  \n5\nUltimately, a tax lien was put in place for around $7,8883. Applicant states,\nwithout documentary evidence, that she took a loan to satisfy the lien. She is currently\nindebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for approximately $12,500. It is being\n\n As evidence of this plan, Applicant submitted a single month\u2019s \u201cMonthly Statement\u201d from the IRS,\n      6\nindicating her \u201cnext payment of $340,\u201d was due on February 28, 2009. This amount was due on a then-current\nbalance of approximately $8,000 (including approximately $3,700 in interest). The statement reflects no prior\nhistory of payments toward her obligation for tax years 1997, 1998, and 2001. See Applicant\u2019s Response to\nthe FORM.\n Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.\n      7\n As depicted in SOR allegations 1.a, 1.j, and 1.k. The remaining two allegations (1.h and 1.i) concern\n      8\nbankruptcy petitions which, by themselves, are legal and legitimate methods for resolving financial problems\nand do not necessarily raise significant security concerns. Here, Applicant sought bankruptcy protection not\nto satisfy extraneous debts, but to protect her home. \n Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.\n      9\n3\nrepaid through a payment plan under which she pays $350 a month.  After making\n6\npayments on this debt for a certain amount of time, Applicant claims the IRS will drop\nthe 1996 and 1997 tax liabilities, lowering the total amount owed to about $5,000 or\nless.  Much of the sum now owed is derived from penalties and interest. Otherwise,\n7\nApplicant has been current on her federal taxes for the past decade.\nThe SOR also cites to nine negative entries on Applicant\u2019s credit report.\nApplicant initially denied all allegations in her first answer to the SOR. Some of those\nanswers were amended in her response to the FORM. The six delinquent accounts at\nissue unrelated to her tax situation  are: \n8\nMEDICAL PROVIDER ($46) \u2013 No proof of payment. Regarding SOR allegation 1.b,\nApplicant stated she is not indebted to this creditor because \u201cthe amount was paid off at\nor on 2007. In fact, that amount was turned over to a collector before my insurance\nactually paid that amount back to the doctor.\u201d  In her response to the FORM, Applicant\n9\nstated she had a receipt showing the bill was paid. What was submitted, however, was\na form sent to her from the medical office regarding a request to delete its account from\nher credit report. The form includes a section indicating the amount due ($25.00) and a\nsection to be remitted with payment. No evidence of payment by Applicant or any other\nparty is included, nor is evidence that the account is now at zero and in good standing. \nMEDICAL PROVIDER ($25) \u2013 No proof of payment. Regarding SOR allegation 1.c,\nApplicant stated she paid this amount in 2007. In her response to the FORM, Applicant\nstated she had a receipt showing the bill was paid. What she submitted, however, was\na form sent to her from the medical office regarding a request to delete its account from\nher credit report. The form includes a section indicating the amount due ($46.00) and a\nsection to be remitted with payment. No evidence of actual payment by Applicant or any\nevidence that the account is now at zero and in good standing is included. \nCOLLECTIONS ($157) \u2013 No proof of payment. Regarding SOR allegation 1.d,\nApplicant stated in her response to the SOR that she paid this balance \u201cin April/May\n\n Id.\n      10\n Item 6 (Jun. 18, 2008, credit report), at 2, indicating $466 past due.\n      11\n May 7, 2009, Letter in response to the FORM.\n      12\n4\ntimeframe (sic) 2007.\u201d  She failed, however, to submit any evidence of payment or that\n10\nthe account is now at zero and in good standing.\nCOLLECTIONS ($575) \u2013 No proof of payment or repayment plan/debt consolidation.\nRegarding allegation 1.e, Applicant initially denied this allegation and stated that she\nhad negotiated a settlement with this entity to pay off the balance by October 31, 2008.\nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant agreed to the allegation, stating that the bill\n\u201chas been incorporated into the bills for the debt consolidation company.\u201d There is no\nevidence, however, of an arrangement with a debt consolidation company or other\nevidence concerning this outstanding account. \nCREDITOR ($466) \u2013 No proof of payment or deletion from credit report. Regarding\nallegation 1.f, Applicant initially stated the proper balance owed was $361, an amount\nshe claimed was paid on October 2, 2008. In her response ot the FORM, Applicant\nwrote: \u201cThis debt is showing as paid off as of October 2008. I personally spoke to this\ncollection agency and it was quoted to me (by them) that their bill was paid off last year\nand I owe them nothing.\u201d No documentary evidence was introduced, however,\nsubstantiating this assertion or otherwise showing the account now reflects a zero\nbalance in good standing. Further, Applicant failed to provide any documentary\nevidence as to how this account was reflected on her credit report on or after October\n2008 in order to refute its representation on her June 18, 2008, credit report, included in\nthe FORM at item 6.11\nCOLLECTIONS/TELECOMMUNICATIONS ($1,581) \u2013 No proof of payment or other\narrangement to settle obligation. Regarding allegation 1.g, Applicant initially denied this\nallegation, indicating she had an arrangement to settle her obligation by payment of\n$700 by November 14, 2008. In her response to the FORM, however, she agreed to the\nallegation, stating \u201c[t]his bill is not showing up on my credit report. However, I know that\nI owed a balance when this account was closed.\u201d\nRecently, in 2007, Applicant fractured her arm after falling off a van at work. This\ncaused her to miss \u201ca lot of work\u201d while she sought treatment for her condition.  Later,\n12\nafter receiving the SOR, Applicant reviewed her credit report. Looking forward to her\nretirement, she saw this as an opportunity to clear up her credit. She states she has\ncontacted a \u201cdebt solution\u201d company to help her resolve her financial issues and a \u201ctax\nconsultant\u201d for advice on her tax situation, but provided no evidence of her efforts with\nsuch professionals. Moreover, there is no evidence establishing she has received\nfinancial counseling. As of the date of her response to the FORM, Applicant was\n\u201cchecking . . . to make sure that the debt solution company is legitimate and making a\n\n Id.\n      13\n Id.\n      14\n Id.\n      15\n5\ndecision to go with one of these company\u2019s [sic] to get my debt cleared up completely\nand finally.\u201d13\nApplicant is devoted to her work and has enjoyed her nearly 32 years of service\nwith the company. She has maintained a security clearance previously without incident.\nShe leads a simple life with few unnecessary extras. She states that \u201cthe debt that [she\nhas] is no worse than the debt that a lot of people incur in the course of a lifetime that\nhave on-going health issues. I am an hourly employee with very limited \u2018sick leave\u2019 time\nand after that I am not paid at all for time off from work.\u201d  She believes she will be\n14\n\u201cgood to go\u201d by the end of 2009 with regard to getting her debt resolved.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      16\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      17\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      18\n Id.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      21\n6\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n16\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n17\n18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n19\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n20\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that\n21\nperson\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\n\\\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      22\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.22\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nHere, Applicant has six delinquent accounts which remain substantially\nunaddressed after the issuance of the SOR and LOR. She also incurred a liability for\nfailure to timely file her federal taxes for several years. Such facts are sufficient to give\nrise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant\nto overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant incurred tax liability when she failed to file her federal tax returns for a\nnumber of years. A couple of those years occurred when she was the sole familial\nincome generator, seeking separation and divorce from a first husband who contributed\nlittle to the family coffers. During this time frame, she also instituted bankruptcy\nproceedings designed not to relieve Applicant of various debts, but to protect her\nhomestead. Further, she has a history of hypertension and diabetes, and she most\nrecently fractured an arm on the job. At least two of the six unaddressed delinquent\naccounts are medical in nature. To the limited extent these factors contributed to her\nacquisition of her delinquent debt, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nOtherwise, Applicant\u2019s efforts toward resolving her delinquent debt are lacking\nwith regard to substantiating evidence. She initially claimed at least two of her\ndelinquent accounts for $575 and $1,581 would be resolved in 2008, then later\nacknowledged they remained outstanding. She claimed an obligation for $466 was\nsatisfied in 2008 and so reflected on her credit report, but failed to submit a copy of the\npertinent section of that more recent credit report to substantiate her claim. Likewise, no\nevidence was submitted to show a debt of $157 was previously satisfied. The evidence\nsubmitted regarding her medical bills indicates that a dispute action was taken to\nremove their entry from her credit report, but those same statements include stubs to\nbe submitted with payments for the amounts alleged. Consequently, there is no\nevidence of actual payment. \n\n8\nFinally, with regard to her tax situation, Applicant\u2019s written explanation as to her\ncurrent repayment status is highly credible. Her explanation reflects the terminology and\nnuance related to the repayment of past tax liabilities through a repayment plan.\nMoreover, she has submitted one monthly statement reminding her of her next due\npayment of $340. However, there is no documentation indicating that she is in timely\nrepayment on what appears to be a debt of approximately $8,000, how many other\npayments have been made, or how she is progressing on her overall obligation. As for\nher nearly $8,000 tax lien, which she claims she satisfied by borrowing money from\nanother source, there is no evidence of its satisfaction. Nor is there evidence of either\nher progress on, or the satisfaction of, the obligation created by that loan. Choosing a\ndecision on the record precludes further inquiry into these matters and the ability to\nextend additional time for the acquisition of additional documentation. As the record\ncurrently reflects, the delinquent debts at issue remain largely unaddressed to date.\nConsequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d)\ncannot apply. Moreover, based on the very limited facts presented and in the absence\nof additional facts (e.g., whether Applicant pursued financial counseling) none of the\nother available mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature woman who has devoted over three decades to her\nemployer, enjoys the challenges of her employment, and has never been involved in an\n\n9\nadverse security incident. Neither her abilities, qualifications, nor her dedication are at\nissue.\nApplicant\u2019s first husband abdicated the role of head of the financial household to\nher. She struggled to make ends meet and keep their mortgage timely. To that end, she\nsought bankruptcy protection to save their home, but that action was later dismissed.\nHer second husband has helped her with her finances, but that help has not\ncompensated for a lack of financial counseling and assistance. Despite her express\nintentions, debts she hoped to satisfy in 2008 remain outstanding or lack appropriate\ndocumentation of payment. Documents submitted to demonstrate payment of a debt or\nprogress on a repayment plan are insufficient as forms of evidence. While there is no\nbasis to doubt Applicant\u2019s honesty or sincerity, her proffers do not substantiate her\nclaims of progress on her debts. In light of the fact the ultimate burden is on Applicant,\nfinancial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated. Consequently, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

On February 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E.\nMalone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline\nG is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found Applicant had consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from at least 1999 to at least June 2007.  In 1999 Applicant was charged with driving\nunder the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of at least .10%.  She was found\nguilty of the offense, fined, and her driving privileges were revoked for one year.  In 2007 Applicant\nwas charged with driving under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of .21%.  She was convicted\nand sentenced to 33 days in jail, with 30 days suspended conditioned on five years good behavior,\ncompletion of the Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and payment of her fines and costs.1\n  \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge\u2019s findings contain multiple errors.  Applicant also argues that her alcohol consumption does\nnot present a problem and that she would not have driven in an intoxicated state in 2007 had\nsomeone told her that it could result the revocation of her security clearance.   Applicant\u2019s arguments\n2\ndo not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  To\n\nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that she was hired in 2004, when in fact she was\n3\nhired in 2003, and erred in finding that she attended karaoke events weekly, when in fact she attends them once or twice\na month.\nDecision at 6.\n4\n3\nthe extent that there is error, it is harmless in that it would not change the outcome of the case.3\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d4\nis sustainable.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Franklin J. McElhaney, Union Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 17, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF\n86) to request a security clearance as part of her employment with a defense contractor.\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant\n1\na security clearance. On October 1, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline G (alcohol consumption).\n2\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 6, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on\nDecember 13, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted\nsix exhibits offered by the government (Gx. 1 - 6). Applicant testified in her own behalf,\nand offered one exhibit, which was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(Ax.) A. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s request to renew her\nsecurity clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant consumed alcohol between\n1999 and 2007, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the\ngovernment alleged Applicant was arrested in April 1999 and charged with driving while\nintoxicated, as a result of which she was fined and her driving privileges were\nsuspended for one year. In SOR \u00b6 1.c, the government alleged Applicant was arrested\nin March 2007 and charged with driving under the influence, for which she was\nsentenced to 33 days in jail (30 of which were suspended for five years), her driving\nprivileges were restricted for one year, she was fined, and she was ordered to complete\na 10-week alcohol safety awareness program (ASAP).\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, but admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\nand 1.c. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 44 years old and has worked since 2004 as a security guard for a\ndefense contractor at a NASA facility. She attended college at a large state university\nfrom September 1981 until June 1982, and is a single mother of two, ages 12 and 20. At\nworks, she also serves as a union shop steward at work. Applicant is generally well-\nregarded by her co-workers, especially for her work in support of diversity workshops\nand other issues of importance to her constituents. (Ax. A) Applicant carries a firearm as\npart of her duties. (Tr., 52) \nOn or about April 18, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving\nunder the influence of alcohol. It was her birthday and she had been out celebrating.\nApplicant estimated she had about four glasses of wine that evening and that her blood\nalcohol content (BAC) was at least .10%. (Tr., 36 - 37) She was found guilty, fined, and\nher driving privileges were revoked for one year. (Answer; Tr, 39)\nOn March 2, 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol with a BAC of .21%. (Gx. 6) Applicant had been at a club on the\nbase where she works and was driving home. She testified she had two glasses of wine\nand two beers over a five hour period. The BAC was based on a blood test, but the vials\nwere not admitted at her trial because of defective chain of custody. However, based on\nher admissions at trial, she was convicted and sentenced to 33 days in jail. The judge\nsuspended 30 days of her sentence. However, the suspended sentence was\nconditioned for five years on good behavior, completion of ASAP, payment of her fines\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n3\nand costs, and that she have no further arrests for DUI, or arrests for reckless or\naggressive driving, or arrests for driving while drinking. (Gx. 3; Gx. 6)\nOn June 15, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to DOHA\ninterrogatories about her consumption of alcohol and her alcohol-related arrests.\nApplicant acknowledged she consumes alcohol; that her drink of choice is wine; that\nshe had last consumed alcohol on June 2, 2007; that she at times drinks to the point of\nintoxication; and that she was last intoxicated the night she was arrested for DUI in\nMarch 2007. (Gx. 2) As to her admission in response to the interrogatories that she at\ntimes drinks to the point of intoxication, Applicant insists she did not understand the\nquestion as it was drafted and did not know she could elaborate. Had she known that,\nshe \u201cwould have filled in something totally different...\u201d (Tr., 22 - 23, 32)\nWhen Applicant was hired in 2004, she initially denied she had ever been in\ntrouble. Upon being asked by the company security officer a second time, she disclosed\nher 1999 DUI. She was told that a single offense would probably not prevent her from\ngetting a security clearance. (Tr., 20) Applicant further testified that she would not have\ngotten her second DUI in 2007 had anyone told her it would adversely impact her\nsuitability for a security clearance. (Tr., 20 - 21)\nApplicant first used alcohol in her early 20's. She primarily drinks wine, but was\nevasive in her testimony when asked how often she has been intoxicated, preferring to\ndebate the definition of \u201cintoxicated\u201d rather than give straightforward answers to\nquestions about how often she has been intoxicated. (Tr., 26, 33 - 35) At one point in\nher testimony, she stated she has only been intoxicated twice, on the dates she was\narrested for DUI in 1999 and 2000. (Tr., 23) On cross-examination, she admitted she\nhas been intoxicated more than twice. (Tr., 34 - 35) Applicant also testified she attends\na weekly karaoke event at the club where she was drinking before her most recent DUI,\nbut if she drinks she has someone else drive her home. She was leaving the same\nevent when she was arrested in March 2007. (Tr., 31, 53 - 54) \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n4\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties at hearing require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) at AG \u00b6 21.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption. \nUnder Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) The government alleged\nApplicant has consumed alcohol since 1997, at times to excess, and that her alcohol\nconsumption has resulted in two arrests and convictions in the last 10 years for driving\nunder the influence of alcohol. Available information is sufficient to support the SOR\nallegations. Applicant\u2019s testimony about her use of alcohol in support of her denial of\nSOR \u00b6 1.a was not credible. In addition to the two arrests, she begrudgingly admitted\nshe has been intoxicated at other times. She continues to consume alcohol, and intends\nto do so in the future. As to whether she has engaged in excessive use of alcohol, I\nconclude it is more likely than not that she has done so more often than she will admit.\nDespite the fact the evidence of a .21% BAC was not used to convict her of her March\n2007 DUI charge, the court nonetheless had enough information to convict and was\nsufficiently concerned about her drinking to impose a five-year condition on the\nsuspension of most of her 33-day jail sentence.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 3, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n5\nBased on the foregoing, the Guideline G disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a)\n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under  the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent) and 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent) must be considered. By contrast, the recency of her latest arrest,\nand her evasiveness about the true scope of her drinking habits preclude consideration\nof any of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 23.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline G. I have also reviewed\nthe record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG 2(a).8\nApplicant is a mature adult, a single mother of two, and is well-respected at work.\nHowever, her unwillingness to be forthcoming about her use of alcohol precludes a\nconclusion she is rehabilitated and unlikely to engage in such conduct in the future. Of\nparticular concern is her assertion that, after having worked in her current job as an\narmed security guard at a sensitive facility for nearly three years, she needed someone\nto explain to her the security significance of having a second alcohol-related arrest in\n2007. Such a response to the government\u2019s concerns reflects an inability or\nunwillingness to accept responsibility for her actions. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all of the information bearing on Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol shows there\n9\nare still doubts about her ability to protect the government\u2019s interests as her own.\nBecause the protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations,\nsuch doubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.10\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old business woman and entrepreneur. She was born, raised, and educated in Iran (Tr. 26). She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and a master\u2019s degree in abstract mathematics in 1994 from an Iranian university (Tr. 120). Applicant had started another master\u2019s degree in operations research, but was expelled in 1992 from the university before she completed her degree because she did not cover her face and hair as required by Islamic law (Tr. 25). While attending her master\u2019s classes, Applicant also taught at the university. While studying in Iran, Applicant taught high school and college classes. After she completed her education, Applicant worked for an Iranian company managing and coordinating the construction of a mid-size airport (Tr. 28). She claimed the company was privately owned. Applicant married her Iranian-born spouse in 1988 in Iran (GE 1). He was a professor at the same Iranian university she attended. He attended college in the United States and had real estate investments in the United States (Tr. 121-122).

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nSeptember 4, 2007. On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).1  \n  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApril 2, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on November 16, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December \n19, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 24, 2007. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on January 29, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 20).2 Applicant testified on her \nown behalf, and presented the testimony of one witness and six exhibits, marked AE 1 \nthrough 6, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old business woman and entrepreneur. She was born, \nraised, and educated in Iran (Tr. 26). She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied \nmathematics and a master\u2019s degree in abstract mathematics in 1994 from an Iranian \nuniversity (Tr. 120). Applicant had started another master\u2019s degree in operations \nresearch, but was expelled in 1992 from the university before she completed her degree \nbecause she did not cover her face and hair as required by Islamic law (Tr. 25). While \nattending her master\u2019s classes, Applicant also taught at the university.  \n \nWhile studying in Iran, Applicant taught high school and college classes. After \nshe completed her education, Applicant worked for an Iranian company managing and \ncoordinating the construction of a mid-size airport (Tr. 28). She claimed the company \nwas privately owned. \n \nApplicant married her Iranian-born spouse in 1988 in Iran (GE 1). He was a \nprofessor at the same Iranian university she attended. He attended college in the United \nStates and had real estate investments in the United States (Tr. 121-122). In 1989, \nApplicant travelled to the United States for the first time with her then husband (Tr. 41). \nFrom 1989 to 1994, Applicant and her spouse lived in the United States during \napproximately six months each year, and travelled back to Iran and lived there for the \nremainder of the year (Tr. 121). She has an 18-year-old son born in Iran of this marriage \n(Tr. 23-24). He is soon to be sworn in as a U.S. naturalized citizen, and currently \nattends a U.S. university on a scholarship (Tr. 45). According to Applicant, her son has \nno Iranian friends, and is not a practicing Moslem. He does not have an Iranian \npassport and has never traveled to Iran.  \n \nIn 1994, Applicant emigrated to the United States with her husband and child. \nShe divorced her spouse in 2000 in the United States (Tr. 76). Since their divorce, \nApplicant has little or no contact with her ex-spouse. Applicant became a U.S. \nnaturalized citizen in 1997. She described her naturalization as an emotional event (Tr. \n \n2  GE 3 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \n42-44). She feels she belongs in the American society, and has had great support from \nher American friends. She claimed her social network of friends is composed primarily \nof U.S. citizens. She has limited contact with the Iranian community in the United \nStates. Applicant believes in God, but testified she is not a religious person, and is not a \npracticing Moslem. She testified she has no property or any financial interests in Iran. \nApplicant has not travelled to Iran since 1994, and she stated her intent never to return \nto Iran (Tr. 51). \n \nIn 2004, Applicant founded her own company in the United States and requires \naccess to classified information to participate in promoting her company\u2019s business and \nto qualify for contracts with the federal government (Tr. 26). She started working full \ntime for her company in 2006. Applicant\u2019s company has a facility\u2019s top secret clearance \n(Tr. 108). Applicant had interim access to classified information for approximately seven \nmonths prior to her hearing (Tr. 26-28). Applicant\u2019s company is a sub-contractor in \nseveral important contracts with U.S. government agencies. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parent\u2019s were born, raised and educated in Iran. They are Iranian \ncitizens, and they live with Applicant when they are present in the United States (Tr. 46-\n49). Her father is 72 years old. He was an engineer for an Iranian oil company. In that \nposition, he supervised/managed approximately 100 employees (Tr 125, 133). He \nretired from his employment after 30 years of service. Initially, Applicant claimed not to \nknow whether her father was receiving a pension from the government of Iran (Tr. 100-\n101). Later she changed her testimony and clarified she believes her father receives a \npension from the Iranian government (Tr. 116). Her mother completed high school, but \nwas a homemaker for most of her life. Her parents would like to become U.S. citizens \nbut are working to improve their English language ability (Answer).  \n \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant\u2019s parents were living in Iran. They left for \nIran sometime prior to her hearing, and she believes they will spend approximately six \nmonths visiting their relatives in Iran (Tr. 105). Since 1999, her parents have been \ntravelling back and forth each year between Iran and the United States. They spend \nclose to half of each year living with Applicant in the United States. The remainder of the \nyear they spend with their other children living in Iran (Tr. 97).3 While in the United \nStates, Applicant\u2019s parents have telephone contact with their relatives in Iran at least \nonce every two weeks (Tr. 99). \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and her two sisters living in Iran jointly own an apartment \nbuilding in Iran. She is not aware of the percentage of ownership between them (Tr. 49-\n50). Her parents\u2019 home was demolished so that her sisters and her husbands could \nbuild a new apartment building to live in. Her parents keep ownership of the land. Her \nparents have an apartment in the new apartment building.  \n \n \n3  Applicant initially testified her parents were living permanently with her, and that they travelled \nto Iran every year, and stayed there visiting their relatives for a period of one to three months (Tr. 97). \nShe later clarified that her parents stay in Iran for a period of four to six months every year (Tr. 126). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has a 38-year-old sister living in the United States. She emigrated to \nthe United States in 1999, and would like to become a U.S. naturalized citizen. She \nreceived an engineering degree in agriculture from an Iranian university. However, she \nis a homemaker. Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s husband was born in Iran. Applicant believes he \nbecame a U.S. naturalized citizen in 2007 (Tr. 127). Applicant\u2019s sister has traveled to \nIran approximately every other year since 1999, and stays in Iran for approximately one \nmonth during her visits (Tr. 54, 104). The last time she visited Iran was in 2006 (Tr. \n105). She has no financial interests or property in Iran. She provides charitable \ncontributions to an orphanage in Iran (Tr. 56). According to Applicant, her sister has no \nintention to go back to live in Iran (Tr. 56).  \n \nApplicant has three siblings living in Iran who are citizens and residents of Iran. \nHer two sisters were rejected from medical school because they attended a combined \ngender school in violation of Islamic law (Tr. 64). They both graduated from mid-wife \nschool (Tr. 57). Both sisters are married to practicing physicians and have never been \nto the United States. They live in an apartment building owned by them and their \nparents. Applicant does not know the frequency of her telephonic contact with her \nsisters (Tr. 68). She has unscheduled telephonic contact with her sisters \u2013 sometimes \nthey talk once a week, sometimes once a month. Applicant never corresponds with her \nsisters via e-mail or written correspondence because she is concerned about the Iranian \ngovernment monitoring their communications (Tr. 60). Both of her sisters would like to \nemigrate to the United States (Tr. 64). They also contribute financially to the same \nIranian orphanage her sister in the United States sponsors (Tr. 63). \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is 41 years old, and married. He is an architect by profession \nand owns his own private consulting firm. Applicant believes he does not have any ties \nto the Iranian government (Answer). He served in the Iranian Army for approximately \none and one-half year (Tr. 130). She has contact with her brother approximately once a \nyear during the New Year holidays (Tr. 72). \n \nApplicant claimed that none of her relatives in Iran, including her parents and \nsiblings, have ever asked her about her work, and that they have no knowledge of what \nshe does for a living (Tr. 50). Only her sister living in the United States is aware \nApplicant is applying for access to classified information (GE 2). She testified that none \nof her relatives in Iran have any current political difficulties with the Iranian government. \nHer relatives do not work for or have any business relationship with the Iranian \ngovernment, and they are not involved in any social or political organization. She \nclaimed her siblings are hostile to the current Iranian government. All of her relatives \nhave philosophical objections to the current Iranian government. \n \nApplicant considers herself a loyal American. She believes the United States has \nthe best constitution in the world, and that the United States should act as the \u201cfather of \nthe world\u201d (Tr. 89). She promised to report any inquiries about her work and/or any \npossible threat against the United States from any foreigners, U.S. citizens, or from her \nfamily members (Tr. 90-94). She also promised to protect classified information even it \nher doing so would be the downfall of her business or her family (Tr. 93). She also \n\n \n5 \n \n \npromised to promote the interest of the United States (Tr. 90), and to do anything she \ncould to overcome the Iranian government (Tr. 94).  \n \nApplicant claimed she would not go back to Iran for any reason, including a sick \nfamily member or the death of a family member (Tr. 91). In her answer to the SOR, she \nstated that \u201c[she] simply do not attach any overriding significance to relationships based \nsolely on blood of family ties.\u201d She believes she would place herself at risk if she were \nto go back to Iran because of her protests against the Iranian government while she \nwas attending college (Tr. 92). She participated in two protests against the Iranian \ngovernment when it intended to close schools for four years, and to force women to \ncover their hair and faces (Tr. 95-96). In 1992, she was expelled for one year from the \nuniversity (GE 2). \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government background \ninvestigator. During the interview she disclosed trips in 2006 to Dubai (twice) and India \nwhere she met with foreign nationals trying to develop her company\u2019s business. During \nthese trips, she met with numerous foreign nationals with whom she maintains \ninfrequent telephone contact. Applicant was not sure whether she had properly reported \nher contacts with foreign nationals (GE 2). One of her sisters traveled from Iran to Dubai \nto meet with Applicant during one of her trips. \n \nApplicant received solid recommendations from her colleagues in business, \nfriends, and past supervisors (AE 1c-e). She is considered to be a hard-working, ethical, \nand dedicated employee. In general, she is perceived as being highly professional and \nhonest. She is trustworthy, dependable, and committed to principles of freedom and \ndemocracy. Her references recommended her for a security clearance. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iran is a \u201ctheocratic Islamic \nrepublic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures.\u201d Iran engages \nin clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD) in defiance of the International community, sponsors international \nterrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, is arming terrorists in Iraq, \nundermines the Middle East peace process, and violates the human rights of the Iranian \npeople. The United States and its allies are attempting to block Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining \nnuclear weapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iraq and \nother the Middle East countries.  \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who pursue sectarian \nviolence in Iraq. Iranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the \nrisks of travel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian \nauthorities. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has \nharassed and detained dual citizens of the United States and Iran. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and, \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.6 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with her parents and siblings. Her parents and \nsiblings are citizens and residents of Iran (except one of her sisters who is a U.S. \nresident). Her parents live with Applicant when they live in the United States. The \ncloseness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone contacts with \nher siblings. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Iranian agents or terrorists may exploit the \nopportunity to obtain information about the United States. Her connection to her family \nmembers also creates a potential conflict of interest because her relationships are \nsufficiently close to raise a security concern about her desire to help them by providing \nsensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because Iran and the United States\u2019 relationship is far from \nfriendly. Her connections to her Iranian family also create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause her relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about her \ndesire to help her family by providing sensitive information. Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nher parents creates a \u201cheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or \ncoercion\u201d because they return to Iran every year for an extended period and could be \nsubjected to Iranian pressure. \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies.  \n \nApplicant has not traveled to Iran since 1994, and she became a U.S. naturalized \ncitizen in 1997. She has contacts and close relationships with her parents and sister \nliving in the United States who are citizens of Iran. Applicant also has contacts and \nclose relationship with her siblings who are residents and citizens of Iran. Her sister \nliving in the United States travels every other year to Iran and stays there with her \nrelatives for approximately one month. Her parents have lived with Applicant since \n1999, and they have traveled to Iran every year since 1999. They lived approximately \nhalf of each year in Iran and the other half of the year in the United States. They travel \nto Iran to visit their children and relatives living in Iran.  \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Appellant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[she] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [her \nIranian family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Her frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with her Iranian family members could potentially force her to choose \nbetween the United States and Iran. She did not meet her burden of showing there is \n\u201clittle likelihood that [her relationships with her Iranian family members] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nThe nature of Iran\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The hostility of Iran \nto the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that her immediate family members in Iran (visiting or living in Iran) do not \npose a security risk and she will not be placed into a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and her Iranian family members.7 With its \nadversarial stance and its negative human rights record, it is likely that Iran would target \nany citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive information from the United \nStates. \n \nApplicant testified she was expelled twice from an Iranian university for protesting \nactions by the Iranian government, and that her sisters were barred from medical school \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nbecause they attended mixed gender schools. To a certain extent, her family members \nliving in Iran, and her parents, have challenged the policies of the Iranian government. \nThus, it is more likely the Iranian government is monitoring her parents\u2019 and sister\u2019s trips \nto Iran, as well as all their communications. On the other hand, there is no evidence that \nany of her relatives work for the Iranian government or military or any news media. \nThere is no evidence that the Iranian government has approached any of her Iranian \nfamily for any reason, and in particular, has not approached them recently about \nApplicant. There is no evidence that her family living in Iran currently engages in \nactivities which would bring attention to themselves or that they are even aware of her \nwork.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Foreign Influence mitigating conditions cannot be applied in this \ncase, and the security concerns cannot be fully mitigated because there is no reason for \nIran to contact her relatives about Applicant until she receives access to classified \ninformation. Even taking for granted that her family members currently have low-key \nnon-controversial lifestyles, and that the Iranian government has not contacted them \nabout Applicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns because of the nature of the Iranian government and its relationship to the \nUnited States. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the United States\u2019 interests. She has lived in the United States for \napproximately 14 years. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen and all of her financial and \nbusiness interests are in the United States. Applicant has established herself as an \nAmerican citizen and a successful business woman (Tr. 149). She has worked hard for \nnumerous employers in the United States, and she continues this track record of diligent \nlabor in the development of her company. Although this mitigating condition is \napplicable, it is insufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant strongly averred her loyalty to the United States, that she feels like an \nAmerican, her desire to help the United States against any possible enemies, and her \ndesire to help the United States to overcome the current Iranian government. Applicant \nhas lived in the United States for 14 years and has been a naturalized citizen for 11 \nyears. When she became a U.S. citizen, she swore allegiance to the United States. Her \nson is also a U.S. citizen, and her parents and one of her sisters are U.S. residents.  \n \nNotwithstanding, her parents travelled to Iran and have lived in Iran for \napproximately six months of every year since 1999. Her sister travels to Iran every other \nyear and stays in Iran for approximately one month. Applicant has strong ties of \naffection and or obligation to her parents and siblings, including those in Iran. Because \nher family members travel to Iran and live in Iran for long periods of time, they are \nvulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power. Applicant\u2019s statement about \nher loyalty to the United States is credible, and there is no reason to believe that she \nwould take any action which could cause potential harm to her U.S. family or to this \ncountry.  \n \nThere is no evidence she has ever taken any action which could cause potential \nharm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. She credibly stated \nthat she takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously. She has the respect and \ntrust of her business partners, her friends, and family. There is no evidence that she has \nrevealed to her family in Iran the nature of her work or about applying for a security \nclearance.   \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nIran is seeking WMD and Iran\u2019s government is currently in an adversarial position with \nrespect to the United States. More importantly for security purposes, Iran seeks \nsensitive or protected U.S. information. Applicant had significant connections to Iran \nbefore she immigrated to the United States in 1994. She was born in Iran and educated \nin Iranian universities. Likely, the Iranian government is aware of her protests during her \nuniversity days and monitors Applicant\u2019s and her family communications. She has family \nmembers who are Iranian citizens living in Iran, and her parents and sister in the United \nStates travel to and stay in Iran for long periods of time. Applicant has frequent and non-\ncasual contact with her family members living in Iran. These contacts create a risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nIranian agents or terrorists may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in Iran \nto obtain information about the United States.  \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns \narising from her foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 15, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 12, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000.  Three\nof the debts were minor, the largest being $360.  The remaining three were substantial.  Applicant\ntestified that he was disputing the amount of one of the debts, but that otherwise he planned to enter\ninto repayment plans for their resolution using a portion of his income tax refund as a down payment.\nThe Judge found Applicant\u2019s testimony in that regard, and his plan, credible because Applicant was\ncurrently paying off $18,000 in federally insured student loans which he had revived from default\nstatus in 2007.  With respect to that loan, Applicant had made a down payment using part of his\nprevious year\u2019s income tax refund, followed by consistent payments for one year of $150 a month.\nThe lender had then considered the loans rehabilitated and lowered his payments to $125 a month.\nApplicant also had two credit cards with balances of only $170 and $200, which he paid regularly.\nDecision at 2-3.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision should\nbe reversed because there is no reasonable basis to dispute any of the debts and Applicant has not\ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of paying off any of the debts alleged in the SOR, noting that\nthe $18,000 debt for which Applicant established a workable payment plan was not one of the debts\nlisted in the SOR.  Therefore, the Judge should not have given Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve his\noutstanding debts much weight, because such promises to take actions in the future, however sincere,\nare not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial actions.\nIn response, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he would take action to resolve\nhis outstanding debts in accordance with his articulated plan was reasonable because Applicant had\nalready done so on his own initiative with respect to other substantial debts, and that it was likewise\nreasonable for the Judge to evaluate Applicant\u2019s entire financial situation, and not just the debts\nlisted in the SOR, in reaching his conclusions.  In support of his argument, Applicant offers new\n\n3\nevidence which indicates that Applicant has now paid off or settled four of the six debts listed in the\nSOR, including his $13,036 debt for a repossessed car.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nHowever, the Board finds Applicant\u2019s arguments to be otherwise persuasive. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of\n\u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment\nof debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007).  However, an applicant\nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the\nSOR.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).  All that is required is that\nan applicant demonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and\ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 6, 2006).  The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his\noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d)  There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all\noutstanding debts simultaneously.  Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide\nfor the payment of such debts one at a time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n4, 2008).  Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a\nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.   \nThe Board has considered the briefs of the parties, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record as a\nwhole.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence\nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  See also Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  The Judge also examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962).  Department Counsel\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  Accordingly,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate favorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.
